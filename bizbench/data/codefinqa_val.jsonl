borrowing privileges , with draw periods scheduled to end in 2015?", "answer": "1.5", "task": "CodeFinQA", "context": "on a regular basis our special asset committee closely monitors loans , primarily commercial loans , that are not included in the nonperforming or accruing past due categories and for which we are uncertain about the borrower 2019s ability to comply with existing repayment terms . these loans totaled $ .2 billion at both december 31 , 2014 and december 31 , 2013 . home equity loan portfolio our home equity loan portfolio totaled $ 34.7 billion as of december 31 , 2014 , or 17% ( 17 % ) of the total loan portfolio . of that total , $ 20.4 billion , or 59% ( 59 % ) , was outstanding under primarily variable-rate home equity lines of credit and $ 14.3 billion , or 41% ( 41 % ) , consisted of closed-end home equity installment loans . approximately 3% ( 3 % ) of the home equity portfolio was on nonperforming status as of december 31 , 2014 . as of december 31 , 2014 , we are in an originated first lien position for approximately 51% ( 51 % ) of the total portfolio and , where originated as a second lien , we currently hold or service the first lien position for approximately an additional 2% ( 2 % ) of the portfolio . the remaining 47% ( 47 % ) of the portfolio was secured by second liens where we do not hold the first lien position . the credit performance of the majority of the home equity portfolio where we are in , hold or service the first lien position , is superior to the portion of the portfolio where we hold the second lien position but do not hold the first lien . lien position information is generally based upon original ltv at the time of origination . however , after origination pnc is not typically notified when a senior lien position that is not held by pnc is satisfied . therefore , information about the current lien status of junior lien loans is less readily available in cases where pnc does not also hold the senior lien . additionally , pnc is not typically notified when a junior lien position is added after origination of a pnc first lien . this updated information for both junior and senior liens must be obtained from external sources , and therefore , pnc has contracted with an industry-leading third-party service provider to obtain updated loan , lien and collateral data that is aggregated from public and private sources . we track borrower performance monthly , including obtaining original ltvs , updated fico scores at least quarterly , updated ltvs semi-annually , and other credit metrics at least quarterly , including the historical performance of any mortgage loans regardless of lien position that we do or do not hold . this information is used for internal reporting and risk management . for internal reporting and risk management we also segment the population into pools based on product type ( e.g. , home equity loans , brokered home equity loans , home equity lines of credit , brokered home equity lines of credit ) . as part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring , we segment the home equity portfolio based upon the delinquency , modification status and bankruptcy status of these loans , as well as the delinquency , modification status and bankruptcy status of any mortgage loan with the same borrower ( regardless of whether it is a first lien senior to our second lien ) . in establishing our alll for non-impaired loans , we primarily utilize a delinquency roll-rate methodology for pools of loans . in accordance with accounting principles , under this methodology , we establish our allowance based upon incurred losses , not lifetime expected losses . the roll-rate methodology estimates transition/roll of loan balances from one delinquency state ( e.g. , 30-59 days past due ) to another delinquency state ( e.g. , 60-89 days past due ) and ultimately to charge-off . the roll through to charge-off is based on pnc 2019s actual loss experience for each type of pool . each of our home equity pools contains both first and second liens . our experience has been that the ratio of first to second lien loans has been consistent over time and the charge-off amounts for the pools , used to establish our allowance , include losses on both first and second liens loans . generally , our variable-rate home equity lines of credit have either a seven or ten year draw period , followed by a 20-year amortization term . during the draw period , we have home equity lines of credit where borrowers pay either interest or principal and interest . we view home equity lines of credit where borrowers are paying principal and interest under the draw period as less risky than those where the borrowers are paying interest only , as these borrowers have a demonstrated ability to make some level of principal and interest payments . the risk associated with the borrower 2019s ability to satisfy the loan terms upon the draw period ending is considered in establishing our alll . based upon outstanding balances at december 31 , 2014 , the following table presents the periods when home equity lines of credit draw periods are scheduled to end . table 36 : home equity

of potential derivatives-related credit loss : peak , derivative risk equivalent ( 201cdre 201d ) , and average exposure ( 201cavg 201d ) . these measures all incorporate netting and collateral

local insurance operations regardless of currency fluctuations . the principal currencies creating foreign exchange risk for us are the british pound sterling , the euro , and the canadian dollar .

reinsurance of variable annuity guarantees , primarily gmdb and gmib . these reserves are calculated in accordance with sop 03-1 ( sop reserves ) and changes in these reserves are reflected as life and annuity benefit expense , which is included in life underwriting income . in addition , our net income is directly impacted by the change in the fair value of the gmib liability ( fvl ) , which is classified as a derivative according to fas 133 . the fair value liability established for a gmib reinsurance contract represents the differ- ence between the fair value of the contract and the sop 03-1 reserves . changes in the fair value of the gmib liability , net of associated changes in the calculated sop 03-1 reserve , are reflected as realized gains or losses . ace views our variable annuity reinsurance business as having a similar risk profile to that of catastrophe reinsurance , with the probability of long-term economic loss relatively small at the time of pricing . adverse changes in market factors and policyholder behavior will have an impact on both life underwriting income and net income . when evaluating these risks , we expect to be compensated for taking both the risk of a cumulative long-term economic net loss , as well as the short-term accounting variations caused by these market movements . therefore , we evaluate this business in terms of its long-term eco- nomic risk and reward . the ultimate risk to the variable annuity guaranty reinsurance business is a long-term underperformance of investment returns , which can be exacerbated by a long-term reduction in interest rates . following a market downturn , continued market underperformance over a period of five to seven years would eventually result in a higher level of paid claims as policyholders accessed their guarantees through death or annuitization . however , if market conditions improved following a downturn , sop 03-1 reserves and fair value liability would fall reflecting a decreased likelihood of future claims , which would result in an increase in both life underwriting income and net income . as of december 31 , 2008 , management established the sop 03-1 reserve based on the benefit ratio calculated using actual market values at december 31 , 2008 . management exercises judgment in determining the extent to which short-term market movements impact the sop 03-1 reserve . the sop 03-1 reserve is based on the calculation of a long-term benefit ratio ( or loss ratio ) for the variable annuity guarantee reinsurance . despite the long-term nature of the risk the benefit ratio calculation is impacted by short-term market movements that may be judged by management to be temporary or transient . management will , in keeping with the language in sop 03-1 , regularly examine both quantitative and qualitative analysis and management will determine if , in its judgment , the change in the calculated benefit ratio is of sufficient magnitude and has persisted for a sufficient duration to warrant a change in the benefit ratio used to establish the sop 03-1 reserve . this has no impact on either premium received or claims paid nor does it impact the long-term profit or loss of the variable annuity guaran- tee reinsurance . the sop 03-1 reserve and fair value liability calculations are directly affected by market factors , including equity levels , interest rate levels , credit risk and implied volatilities , as well as policyholder behaviors , such as annuitization and lapse rates . the table below shows the sensitivity , as of december 31 , 2008 , of the sop 03-1 reserves and fair value liability associated with the variable annuity guarantee reinsurance portfolio . in addition , the tables below show the sensitivity of the fair value of specific derivative instruments held ( hedge value ) , which includes instruments purchased in january 2009 , to partially offset the risk in the variable annuity guarantee reinsurance portfolio . although these derivatives do not receive hedge accounting treatment , some portion of the change in value may be used to offset changes in the sop 03-1 reserve. .\n", "context_type":

a combined ratio above 100.0 demonstrates underwriting losses . the combined ratio has decreased from 2003 to 2004 primarily because of improvement in the expense ratio . the combined ratio in 2005 could be significantly higher or lower than the 2004 combined ratio depending on the level of catastrophe losses , but will also be impacted by changes in pricing and an expected moderation in favorable loss cost trends . catastrophe ratio : the catastrophe ratio ( a component of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio ) represents the ratio of catastrophe losses ( net of reinsurance ) to earned premiums . a catastrophe is an event that causes $ 25 or more in industry insured property losses and affects a significant number of property and casualty policyholders and insurers . by their nature , catastrophe losses vary dramatically from year to year . based on the mix and geographic dispersion of premium written and estimates derived from various catastrophe loss models , the company 2019s expected catastrophe ratio over the long-term is 3.0 points . before considering the reduction in ongoing operation 2019s catastrophe reserves related to september 11 of $ 298 in 2004 , the catastrophe ratio in 2004 was 5.3 points . see 201crisk management strategy 201d below for a discussion of the company 2019s property catastrophe risk management program that serves to mitigate the company 2019s net exposure to catastrophe losses . combined ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development : the combined ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development represents the combined ratio for the current accident year , excluding the impact of catastrophes . the company believes this ratio is an important measure of the trend in profitability since it removes the impact of volatile and unpredictable catastrophe losses and prior accident year reserve development . before considering catastrophes , the combined ratio related to current accident year business has improved from 2002 to 2004 principally due to earned pricing increases and favorable claim frequency . other operations underwriting results : the other operations segment is responsible for managing operations of the hartford that have discontinued writing new or renewal business as well as managing the claims related to asbestos and environmental exposures . as such , neither earned premiums nor underwriting ratios are meaningful financial measures . instead , management believes that underwriting result is a more meaningful measure . the net underwriting loss for 2002 through 2004 is primarily due to prior accident year loss development , including $ 2.6 billion of net asbestos reserve strengthening in 2003 . reserve estimates within other operations , including estimates for asbestos and environmental claims , are inherently uncertain . refer to the other operations segment md&a for further discussion of other operation's underwriting results . total property & casualty investment earnings .\n\n|  | 2004 | 2003 | 2002 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Investment yield, after-tax | 4.1% | 4.2% | 4.5% |\n| Net realized capital gains (losses), after-tax | $87 | $165 | $(44) |\n\nthe investment return , or yield , on property & casualty 2019s invested assets is an important element of the company 2019s earnings since insurance products are priced with the assumption that premiums received can be invested for a period of time before loss and loss adjustment expenses are paid . for longer tail lines , such as workers 2019 compensation and general liability , claims are paid over several years and , therefore , the premiums received for these lines of business can generate significant investment income . him determines the appropriate allocation of investments by asset class and measures the investment yield performance for each asset class against market indices or other benchmarks . due to the emphasis on preservation of capital and the need to maintain sufficient liquidity to satisfy claim obligations , the vast majority of property and casualty 2019s invested assets have been held in fixed maturities , including , among other asset classes , corporate bonds , municipal bonds , government debt , short-term debt , mortgage- .\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": "total_investment_value = 87 / 0.040999999999999995\nanswer = total_investment_value"}

{"question": "what is the growth rate in net reserves in 2005?", "answer": "11.1000003815", "task": "CodeFinQA", "context": "development of prior year incurred losses was $ 135.6 million unfavorable in 2006 , $ 26.4 million favorable in 2005 and $ 249.4 million unfavorable in 2004 . such losses were the result of the reserve development noted above , as well as inher- ent uncertainty in establishing loss and lae reserves . reserves for asbestos and environmental losses and loss adjustment expenses as of year end 2006 , 7.4% ( 7.4 % ) of reserves reflect an estimate for the company 2019s ultimate liability for a&e claims for which ulti- mate value cannot be estimated using traditional reserving techniques . the company 2019s a&e liabilities stem from mt . mckinley 2019s direct insurance business and everest re 2019s assumed reinsurance business . there are significant uncertainties in estimating the amount of the company 2019s potential losses from a&e claims . see item 7 , 201cmanagement 2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 2014asbestos and environmental exposures 201d and note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements . mt . mckinley 2019s book of direct a&e exposed insurance is relatively small and homogenous . it also arises from a limited period , effective 1978 to 1984 . the book is based principally on excess liability policies , thereby limiting exposure analysis to a lim- ited number of policies and forms . as a result of this focused structure , the company believes that it is able to comprehen- sively analyze its exposures , allowing it to identify , analyze and actively monitor those claims which have unusual exposure , including policies in which it may be exposed to pay expenses in addition to policy limits or non-products asbestos claims . the company endeavors to be actively engaged with every insured account posing significant potential asbestos exposure to mt . mckinley . such engagement can take the form of pursuing a final settlement , negotiation , litigation , or the monitoring of claim activity under settlement in place ( 201csip 201d ) agreements . sip agreements generally condition an insurer 2019s payment upon the actual claim experience of the insured and may have annual payment caps or other measures to control the insurer 2019s payments . the company 2019s mt . mckinley operation is currently managing eight sip agreements , three of which were executed prior to the acquisition of mt . mckinley in 2000 . the company 2019s preference with respect to coverage settlements is to exe- cute settlements that call for a fixed schedule of payments , because such settlements eliminate future uncertainty . the company has significantly enhanced its classification of insureds by exposure characteristics over time , as well as its analysis by insured for those it considers to be more exposed or active . those insureds identified as relatively less exposed or active are subject to less rigorous , but still active management , with an emphasis on monitoring those characteristics , which may indicate an increasing exposure or levels of activity . the company continually focuses on further enhancement of the detailed estimation processes used to evaluate potential exposure of policyholders , including those that may not have reported significant a&e losses . everest re 2019s book of assumed reinsurance is relatively concentrated within a modest number of a&e exposed relationships . it also arises from a limited period , effectively 1977 to 1984 . because the book of business is relatively concentrated and the company has been managing the a&e exposures for many years , its claim staff is familiar with the ceding companies that have generated most of these liabilities in the past and which are therefore most likely to generate future liabilities . the company 2019s claim staff has developed familiarity both with the nature of the business written by its ceding companies and the claims handling and reserving practices of those companies . this level of familiarity enhances the quality of the company 2019s analysis of its exposure through those companies . as a result , the company believes that it can identify those claims on which it has unusual exposure , such as non-products asbestos claims , for concentrated attention . however , in setting reserves for its reinsurance liabilities , the company relies on claims data supplied , both formally and informally by its ceding companies and brokers . this furnished information is not always timely or accurate and can impact the accuracy and timeli- ness of the company 2019s ultimate loss projections . the following table summarizes the composition of the company 2019s total reserves for a&e losses , gross and net of reinsurance , for the years ended december 31: .\n\n| (Dollars in millions) | 2006 | 2005 | 2004 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---

( ii ) the probability of a default event occurring for each counterparty , as derived from observed or estimated cds spreads ; and ( iii ) estimated recovery rates implied by cds , adjusted to consider the differences in recovery rates as a derivative creditor relative to those reflected in cds spreads , which generally reflect senior unsecured creditor risk . as such , the firm estimates derivatives cva relative to the relevant benchmark interest rate . 2022 dva is taken to reflect the credit quality of the firm in the valuation of liabilities measured at fair value . the dva calculation methodology is generally consistent with the cva methodology described above and incorporates jpmorgan chase 2019s credit spread as observed through the cds market to estimate the probability of default and loss given default as a result of a systemic event affecting the firm . structured notes dva is estimated using the current fair value of the structured note as the exposure amount , and is otherwise consistent with the derivative dva methodology . 2022 the firm incorporates the impact of funding in its valuation estimates where there is evidence that a market participant in the principal market would incorporate it in a transfer of the instrument . as a result , the fair value of collateralized derivatives is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows at the relevant overnight indexed swap ( 201cois 201d ) rate given the underlying collateral agreement with the counterparty . effective in 2013 , the firm implemented a fva framework to incorporate the impact of funding into its valuation estimates for uncollateralized ( including partially collateralized ) over- the-counter ( 201cotc 201d ) derivatives and structured notes . the firm 2019s fva framework leverages its existing cva and dva calculation methodologies , and considers the fact that the firm 2019s own credit risk is a significant component of funding costs . the key inputs are : ( i ) the expected funding requirements arising from the firm 2019s positions with each counterparty and collateral arrangements ; ( ii ) for assets , the estimated market funding cost in the principal market ; and ( iii ) for liabilities , the hypothetical market funding cost for a transfer to a market participant with a similar credit standing as the firm . upon the implementation of the fva framework in 2013 , the firm recorded a one time $ 1.5 billion loss in principal transactions revenue that was recorded in the cib . while the fva framework applies to both assets and liabilities , the loss on implementation largely related to uncollateralized derivative receivables given that the impact of the firm 2019s own credit risk , which is a significant component of funding costs , was already incorporated in the valuation of liabilities through the application of dva . the following table provides the credit and funding adjustments , excluding the effect of any associated hedging activities , reflected within the consolidated balance sheets as of the dates indicated. .\n\n| December 31, (in millions) | 2014 | 2013 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Derivative receivables balance<sup>(a)</sup> | $78,975 | $65,759 |\n| Derivative payables balance<sup>(a)</sup> | 71,116 | 57,314 |\n| Derivatives CVA<sup>(b)</sup> | (2,674) | (2,352) |\n| Derivatives DVA and FVA<sup>(b)(c)</sup> | (380) | (322) |\n| Structured notes balance<sup>(a)(d)</sup> | 53,772 | 48,808 |\n| Structured notes DVA and FVA<sup>(b)(e)</sup> | 1,152 | 952 |\n\nderivative receivables balance ( a ) $ 78975 $ 65759 derivative payables balance ( a ) 71116 57314 derivatives cva ( b ) ( 2674 ) ( 2352 ) derivatives dva and fva ( b ) ( c ) ( 380 ) ( 322 ) structured notes balance ( a ) ( d ) 53772 48808 structured notes dva and fva ( b ) ( e ) 1152 952 ( a ) balances are presented net of applicable cva and dva/fva .

follows : ( 1 ) an amount in cash ( the 201cprincipal return 201d ) equal to the lesser of ( a ) the aggregate conversion value of the debentures to be converted and ( b ) the aggregate principal amount of the debentures to be converted , and ( 2 ) if the aggregate conversion value of the debentures to be converted is greater than the principal return , an amount in shares ( the 201cnet shares 201d ) , determined as set forth below , equal to such aggregate conversion value less the principal return ( the 201cnet share amount 201d ) . the number of net shares to be paid will be determined by dividing the net share amount by the ten-day weighted average price . in lieu of delivering fractional shares , the company will deliver cash based on the ten-day weighted average price . the conversion rate for the debentures is subject to adjustments upon the occurrence of certain corporate events , such as a change of control of the company , 193253ti_txt.indd 96 4/2/10 1:18 pm .\n",
