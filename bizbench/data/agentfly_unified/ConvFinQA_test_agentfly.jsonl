million in 2010 compared with net pre-tax catastrophe losses of $ 137 million and $ 567 million in 2009 and 2008 , respectively . the catastrophe losses for 2010 were primarily related to weather- related events in the u.s. , earthquakes in chile , mexico , and new zealand , and storms in australia and europe . the catastrophe losses for 2009 were primarily related to an earthquake in asia , floods in europe , several weather-related events in the u.s. , and a european windstorm . for 2008 , the catastrophe losses were primarily related to hurricanes gustav and ike . prior period development arises from changes to loss estimates recognized in the current year that relate to loss reserves first reported in previous calendar years and excludes the effect of losses from the development of earned premium from pre- vious accident years . we experienced $ 503 million of net favorable prior period development in our p&c segments in 2010 . this compares with net favorable prior period development in our p&c segments of $ 576 million and $ 814 million in 2009 and 2008 , respectively . refer to 201cprior period development 201d for more information . the adjusted loss and loss expense ratio declined in 2010 , compared with 2009 , primarily due to the impact of the crop settlements , non-recurring premium adjustment and the reduction in assumed loss portfolio business , which is written at higher loss ratios than other types of business . our policy acquisition costs include commissions , premium taxes , underwriting , and other costs that vary with , and are primarily related to , the production of premium . administrative expenses include all other operating costs . our policy acquis- ition cost ratio increased in 2010 , compared with 2009 . the increase was primarily related to the impact of crop settlements , which generated higher profit-share commissions and a lower adjustment to net premiums earned , as well as the impact of reinstatement premiums expensed in connection with catastrophe activity and changes in business mix . our administrative expense ratio increased in 2010 , primarily due to the impact of the crop settlements , reinstatement premiums expensed , and increased costs in our international operations . although the crop settlements generate minimal administrative expenses , they resulted in lower adjustment to net premiums earned in 2010 , compared with 2009 . administrative expenses in 2010 , were partially offset by higher net results generated by our third party claims administration business , esis , the results of which are included within our administrative expenses . esis generated $ 85 million in net results in 2010 , compared with $ 26 million in 2009 . the increase is primarily from non-recurring sources . our policy acquisition cost ratio was stable in 2009 , compared with 2008 , as increases in our combined insurance operations were offset by more favorable final crop year settlement of profit share commissions . administrative expenses increased in 2009 , primarily due to the inclusion of administrative expenses related to combined insurance for the full year and costs associated with new product expansion in our domestic retail operation and in our personal lines business . our effective income tax rate , which we calculate as income tax expense divided by income before income tax , is depend- ent upon the mix of earnings from different jurisdictions with various tax rates . a change in the geographic mix of earnings would change the effective income tax rate . our effective income tax rate was 15 percent in 2010 , compared with 17 percent and 24 percent in 2009 and 2008 , respectively . the decrease in our effective income tax rate in 2010 , was primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings to lower tax-paying jurisdictions , a decrease in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits which was the result of a settlement with the u.s . internal revenue service appeals division regarding federal tax returns for the years 2002-2004 , and the recognition of a non-taxable gain related to the acquisition of rain and hail . the 2009 year included a reduction of a deferred tax valuation allowance related to investments . for 2008 , our effective income tax rate was adversely impacted by a change in mix of earnings due to the impact of catastrophe losses in lower tax-paying jurisdictions . prior period development the favorable prior period development , inclusive of the life segment , of $ 512 million during 2010 was the net result of sev- eral underlying favorable and adverse movements . with respect to ace 2019s crop business , ace regularly receives reports from its managing general agent ( mga ) relating to the previous crop

year . higher net interest income , very strong private equity gains , record asset management , administration and commissions revenue , higher mortgage fees and related income and record investment banking fees contributed to the revenue growth . these increases were offset partially by lower trading revenue . investment banking fees grew in 2007 to a level higher than the pre- vious record set in 2006 . record advisory and equity underwriting fees drove the results , partially offset by lower debt underwriting fees . for a further discussion of investment banking fees , which are primarily recorded in ib , see the ib segment results on pages 40 201342 of this annual report . principal transactions revenue consists of trading revenue and private equity gains . trading revenue declined significantly from the 2006 level , primarily due to markdowns in ib of $ 1.4 billion ( net of hedges ) on subprime positions , including subprime cdos , and $ 1.3 billion ( net of fees ) on leveraged lending funded loans and unfunded commitments . also in ib , markdowns in securitized products on nonsubprime mortgages and weak credit trading performance more than offset record revenue in currencies and strong revenue in both rates and equities . equities benefited from strong client activity and record trading results across all products . ib 2019s credit portfolio results increased compared with the prior year , primarily driven by higher revenue from risk management activities . the increase in private equity gains from 2006 reflected a significantly higher level of gains , the classification of certain private equity carried interest as compensation expense and a fair value adjustment in the first quarter of 2007 on nonpublic private equity investments resulting from the adoption of sfas 157 ( 201cfair value measurements 201d ) . for a further discussion of principal transactions revenue , see the ib and corporate segment results on pages 40 201342 and 59 201360 , respectively , and note 6 on page 122 of this annual report . lending & deposit-related fees rose from the 2006 level , driven pri- marily by higher deposit-related fees and the bank of new york transaction . for a further discussion of lending & deposit-related fees , which are mostly recorded in rfs , tss and cb , see the rfs segment results on pages 43 201348 , the tss segment results on pages 54 201355 , and the cb segment results on pages 52 201353 of this annual report . asset management , administration and commissions revenue reached a level higher than the previous record set in 2006 . increased assets under management and higher performance and placement fees in am drove the record results . the 18% ( 18 % ) growth in assets under management from year-end 2006 came from net asset inflows and market appreciation across all segments : institutional , retail , private bank and private client services . tss also contributed to the rise in asset management , administration and commissions revenue , driven by increased product usage by new and existing clients and market appreciation on assets under custody . finally , commissions revenue increased , due mainly to higher brokerage transaction volume ( primarily included within fixed income and equity markets revenue of ib ) , which more than offset the sale of the insurance business by rfs in the third quarter of 2006 and a charge in the first quarter of 2007 resulting from accelerated surrenders of customer annuities . for additional information on these fees and commissions , see the segment discussions for ib on pages 40 201342 , rfs on pages 43 201348 , tss on pages 54 201355 , and am on pages 56 201358 , of this annual report . the favorable variance resulting from securities gains in 2007 compared with securities losses in 2006 was primarily driven by improvements in the results of repositioning of the treasury invest- ment securities portfolio . also contributing to the positive variance was a $ 234 million gain from the sale of mastercard shares . for a fur- ther discussion of securities gains ( losses ) , which are mostly recorded in the firm 2019s treasury business , see the corporate

by $ 374 million to $ 3547 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 . the increase primarily was attributable to an improvement in our operating working capital balances of $ 570 million as discussed below , and $ 187 million related to lower net income tax payments , as compared to 2009 . partially offsetting these improvements was a net reduction in cash from operations of $ 350 million related to our defined benefit pension plan . this reduction was the result of increased contributions to the pension trust of $ 758 million as compared to 2009 , partially offset by an increase in the cas costs recovered on our contracts . operating working capital accounts consists of receivables , inventories , accounts payable , and customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred . the improvement in cash provided by operating working capital was due to a decline in 2010 accounts receivable balances compared to 2009 , and an increase in 2010 customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred balances compared to 2009 . these improvements partially were offset by a decline in accounts payable balances in 2010 compared to 2009 . the decline in accounts receivable primarily was due to higher collections on various programs at electronic systems , is&gs , and space systems business areas . the increase in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred primarily was attributable to an increase on government and commercial satellite programs at space systems and air mobility programs at aeronautics , partially offset by a decrease on various programs at electronic systems . the decrease in accounts payable was attributable to the timing of accounts payable activities across all segments . net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $ 1248 million to $ 3173 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 . the decline primarily was attributable to an increase in our contributions to the defined benefit pension plan of $ 1373 million as compared to 2008 and an increase in our operating working capital accounts of $ 147 million . partially offsetting these items was the impact of lower net income tax payments in 2009 as compared to 2008 in the amount of $ 319 million . the decline in cash provided by operating working capital primarily was due to growth of receivables on various programs in the ms2 and gt&l lines of business at electronic systems and an increase in inventories on combat aircraft programs at aeronautics , which partially were offset by increases in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred on government satellite programs at space systems and the timing of accounts payable activities . investing activities capital expenditures 2013 the majority of our capital expenditures relate to facilities infrastructure and equipment that are incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments . we also incur capital expenditures for it to support programs and general

operating cash flows will continue to be sufficient to fund our annual capital expenditures over the next few years . acquisitions , divestitures and other activities 2013 acquisition activities include both the acquisition of businesses and investments in affiliates . amounts paid in 2010 of $ 148 million primarily related to investments in affiliates . we paid $ 435 million in 2009 for

our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program for the repurchase of our common stock from time-to-time , up to an authorized amount of $ 3.0 billion ( see note 12 ) . under the

seeking the cost of remediating mtbe contamination and natural resources damages allegedly resulting from contamination of groundwater by mtbe . we are vigorously defending these cases . we have

represent the arithmetic average of the inputs and are not weighted by the relative fair value or notional of the respective financial instruments . an average greater than the median indicates that the majority of inputs are below the average . for example , the difference between the average and the median for credit spreads and oil spread inputs indicates that the majority of the inputs fall in the lower end of the range . 2030 the ranges , averages and medians of these inputs are not representative of the appropriate inputs to use when calculating the fair value of any one derivative . for example , the highest correlation for interest rate derivatives is appropriate for valuing a specific interest rate derivative but may not be appropriate for valuing any other interest rate derivative . accordingly , the ranges of inputs do not represent uncertainty in , or possible ranges of , fair value measurements of the firm 2019s level 3 derivatives . 2030 interest rates , currencies and equities derivatives are valued using option pricing models , credit derivatives are valued using option pricing , correlation and discounted cash flow models , and commodities derivatives are valued using option pricing and discounted cash flow models . 2030 the fair value of any one instrument may be determined using multiple valuation techniques . for example , option pricing models and discounted cash flows models are typically used together to determine fair value . therefore , the level 3 balance encompasses both of these techniques . 2030 correlation within currencies and equities includes cross- product type correlation . 2030 natural gas spread represents the spread per million british thermal units of natural gas . 2030 oil spread represents the spread per barrel of oil and refined products . range of significant unobservable inputs the following is information about the ranges of significant unobservable inputs used to value the firm 2019s level 3 derivative instruments : 2030 correlation . ranges for correlation cover a variety of underliers both within one product type ( e.g. , equity index and equity single stock names ) and across product types ( e.g. , correlation of an interest rate and a currency ) , as well as across regions . generally , cross-product type correlation inputs are used to value more complex instruments and are lower than correlation inputs on assets within the same derivative product type . 2030 volatility . ranges for volatility cover numerous underliers across a variety of markets , maturities and strike prices . for example , volatility of equity indices is generally lower than volatility of single stocks . 2030 credit spreads , upfront credit points and recovery rates . the ranges for credit spreads , upfront credit points and recovery rates cover a variety of underliers ( index and single names ) , regions , sectors , maturities and credit qualities ( high-yield and investment-grade ) .

we test goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur that would warrant such review . while the company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment for both goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment exists , the company elects to perform the quantitative assessment for our annual impairment analysis . the impairment analysis involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or non-amortizable intangible asset to the carrying value . if the carrying value exceeds the fair value , goodwill or a non-amortizable intangible asset is considered impaired . to determine the fair value of goodwill , we primarily use a discounted cash flow model , supported by the market approach using earnings multiples of comparable global and local companies within the tobacco industry . at december 31 , 2018 , the carrying value of our goodwill was $ 7.2 billion , which is related to ten reporting units , each of which consists of a group of markets with similar economic characteristics . the estimated fair value of each of our ten reporting units exceeded the carrying value as of december 31 , 2018 . to determine the fair value of non-amortizable intangible assets , we primarily use a discounted cash flow model applying the relief-from-royalty method . we concluded that the fair value of our non- amortizable intangible assets exceeded the carrying value . these discounted cash flow models include management assumptions relevant for forecasting operating cash flows , which are subject to changes in business conditions , such as volumes and prices , costs to produce , discount rates and estimated capital needs . management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values are estimated , and we believe these assumptions are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use . since the march 28 , 2008 , spin-off from altria group , inc. , we have not recorded a charge to earnings for an impairment of goodwill or non-amortizable intangible assets . marketing costs - we incur certain costs to support our products through programs that include advertising , marketing , consumer engagement and trade promotions . the costs of our advertising and marketing programs are expensed in accordance with u.s . gaap . recognition of the cost related to our consumer engagement and trade promotion programs contain uncertainties due to the judgment required in estimating the potential performance and compliance for each program . for volume-based incentives provided to customers , management continually assesses and estimates , by customer , the likelihood of the customer's achieving the specified targets , and records the reduction of revenue as the sales are made . for other trade promotions , management relies on estimated utilization rates that have been developed from historical experience . changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual marketing program would not result in a material change in our financial position , results of operations or operating cash flows . employee benefit plans - as discussed in item 8 , note 13 . benefit plans to our consolidated financial statements , we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees , including pensions , postretirement health care and postemployment benefits ( primarily severance ) . we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by u.s . gaap . these calculations include various actuarial assumptions , such as discount rates , assumed rates of return on plan assets , compensation increases , mortality , turnover rates and health care cost trend rates . we review actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so . as permitted by u.s . gaap , any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods . we believe that the assumptions utilized in calculating our obligations under these plans are reasonable based upon our historical experience and advice from our actuaries . weighted-average discount rate assumptions for pension and postretirement plan obligations at december 31 , 2018 and 2017 are as follows: .\n\n| | | | |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 1 |  | 2018 | 2017 |\n| 2 | pension plans | 1.61% ( 1.61 % ) | 1.51% ( 1.51 % ) |\n| 3 | postretirement plans | 3.97% ( 3.97 % ) | 3.79% ( 3.79 % ) |\n\nwe anticipate that assumption changes will increase 2019 pre-tax pension and postretirement expense to approximately $ 205 million as compared with approximately $ 160 million in 2018 , excluding amounts related to employee severance and early retirement programs . the anticipated increase is primarily due to higher amortization out of other comprehensive earnings for unrecognized actuarial gains/ losses of $ 14 million , coupled with lower return on assets of $ 16 million , higher interest and service cost of $ 12 million and $ 4 million respectively , partially offset by other movements of $ 1 million . weighted-average expected rate of return and discount rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amount of expense reported for the employee benefit plans . a fifty-basis-point decrease in our discount rate would increase our 2019 pension and postretirement expense by approximately $ 50 million , and a fifty-basis-point increase in our discount rate would decrease our 2019 pension and postretirement .\n\nQuestion: what is the pre-tax pension and postretirement expense in 2019?\nAnswer: 205", "ground_truth": "160", "metadata": {"task": "ConvFinQA", "sample_index": 30}}

materials from suppliers . most of the agreements extend for periods of one to three years ( three to five years for software ) . however , generally these agreements do not obligate the company to make any purchases , and many permit the company to terminate the agreement with advance notice ( usually ranging from 60 to 180 days ) . if the company were to terminate these agreements , it generally would be liable for certain termination charges , typically based on work performed and supplier on-hand inventory and raw materials attributable to canceled orders . the company's liability would only arise in the event it terminates the agreements for reasons other than \"\"cause.'' the company also enters into a number of arrangements for the sourcing of supplies and materials with minimum purchase commitments and take-or-pay obligations . the majority of the minimum purchase obligations under these contracts are over the life of the contract as opposed to a year-by-year take-or-pay . if these agreements were terminated at december 31 , 2006 , the company's obligation would not have been significant . the company does not anticipate the cancellation of any of these agreements in the future . subsequent to the end of 2006 , the company entered into take-or-pay arrangements with suppliers through may 2009 with minimum purchase obligations of $ 2.2 billion during that period . the company estimates purchases during that period that exceed the minimum obligations . the company outsources certain corporate functions , such as benefit administration and information technology-related services . these contracts are expected to expire in 2013 . the total remaining payments under these contracts are approximately $ 1.3 billion over the remaining seven years ; however , these contracts can be %%transmsg*** transmitting job : c11830 pcn : 055000000 *** %%pcmsg| |00030|yes|no|02/28/2007 13:05|0|1|page is valid , no graphics -- color : n|

due to weak demand in the home entertainment and consumer products markets , although demand was strong in the tobacco segment . average sales prices for the year were lower than in 2005 . operating prof- its were down significantly from both 2005 and 2004 due to the decline in sales , particularly in the higher margin home entertainment markets , higher raw material costs for bleached board and certain inventory adjustment costs . entering 2007 , coated paperboard first-quarter sales volumes are expected to be seasonally stronger than in the fourth quarter 2006 for folding carton board and bristols . average sales price realizations are expected to rise with a price increase announced in january . it is anticipated that manufacturing costs will improve versus an unfavorable fourth quarter . foodservice earnings for the first quarter of 2007 are expected to decline due to seasonally weaker vol- ume . however , sales price realizations will be slightly higher , and the seasonal switch to hot cup contain- ers will have a favorable impact on product mix . shorewood sales volumes for the first quarter of 2007 are expected to seasonally decline , but the earnings impact will be partially offset by pricing improvements and an improved product mix . distribution our distribution business , principally represented by our xpedx business , markets a diverse array of products and
