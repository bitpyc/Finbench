How \ndo you determ ine how m uch they are worth?  \n \nApproach  \nThis problem involves the interplay of supply and demand forces to determine the value of the \ntankers. The nature of tanker supply w ill be reveale d by defining the different tanker types (in \nlayman’s terms: small, medium, and large) in the industry and the cost-related prices \nassociated w ith employing each type. In effect , a step function supply curve results for the \nindustry w ith each step a different tanker type. Demand for the services of tankers is assumed \nfairly inelastic due to refinery economics domina ting the purchase decision. It w ill turn out (by \ncarefully creating the supply/demand curves) that at the given level of demand, only large and \nmedium tankers are put into supply. This renders your late uncle's small tankers suitable only \nfor scrap at the present time."}

The CEO has asked you to help him  decide if \nthey should build another plant or expand the current plant.   \n \nAdditional inform ation to be divulged gradually : \nThe cost structure for cem ent production is as follows:  \n Raw materials   28% \n Labor and allocated fixed costs 16% \n Distribution   26% \n Sales and overhead  18% \n Pre-tax profit   12% \n \n \nThe com pany’s selling prices are set by prevailing m arket prices in Portugal.  Land is available \nto expand the current factory; there is also a suitable site near Porto, about 200 m iles to the \nnorth.  Approxim ately 80% of the custom ers are within 100 m iles of the current plant.   \n \nRaw m aterials are purchased from  a governm ent-owned com pany, and prices are set by a yearly \ncontract with the governm ent.  The plant is unionized, and extra shifts are not possible.  The \ntrucks are owned by the com pany, and transport all product directly to the custom ers throughout \nthe country.  Custom ers pay for trucking by the m ile.  The fixed cost of plant additions is \nroughly the sam e as the cost of a new plant of the sam e capacity. \n \nSolution : \nAs distribution is the second-largest cost item , it makes sense to m inimize distribution costs in \nchoosing the site of the next facility.  From  the data, it is safe to assum e custom ers that are \nfurther away are less inclined to buy due to the in creased trucking costs.  Therefore, location of \nthe plant in the north m ay increase sales in the north by reducing delivery costs to these \ncustom ers. \n  \nPage 37"}

{"case_id": "LOGGING COMPANY", "case_text": "LOGGING COMPANY  \n \n \nBackground: \nYou are hired by a Canadian logging com pany to analyze its current operations and provide \nadvice on future operations.  The logging industry in Canada is regulated by the governm ent.  \nLand is leased to individual com panies by the governm ent.  The com pany is m aking a lot of \nmoney and is unsure why.  You have been asked to  determ ine: (1) W hy they are m aking \nmoney?  (2) Is it sustainable?  (3) Is it replicable?   \n \nAdditional Details: \n• Products:  The com pany produces lum ber boards of two sizes 2”x4” and 2”x8”.  Lum ber is a \ncommodity product and as such the com pany is a price-taker in the m arket. \nLeases:  The governm ent leases tracts of land at a annual price that is set to allow for a 12% \nprofit m argin for the entire logging industry.  Thus, all tracts of land have the sam e lease \nprice per acre.  The leases last for 99 years and the original lessee has the right of first \nrenewal on the lease. \n• Profit Structure:  The profit equation for the lum ber industry can be written as:  Profit per \nft^3 = Revenue per ft^3 - Non-land cost per ft^3 - Lease Cost per ft^3 \n  \nPage 78 • Revenues:  There is a revenue advantage for the com pany due to its product m ix.  Margins \nare higher on 2”x8” boards than on 2”x4” boards.  The com pany’s product m ix is m ade up of \n a greater percentage of 2”x8” boards than the “typical” logging com pany percentage. \n• Non-land Costs:  The com pany has a 5% cost  advantage in its ”tree-to-dock” production \nprocess.  There is no significant difference be tween the distribution costs am ong the industry \nfirms. \n• Production Process: The cost advantage is not generated by a better logging process (i.e. \nbetter equipm ent, m ore skilled laborers) but instead exists because of the exceptional quality \nof the trees on the particular piece of land that the com pany leases.  The m ineral content of \nthe land leads to faster growth of healthier trees which im proves both yield and turnover.  \nHealthier trees are straighter and easier to cut, thus reducing costs in each phase of the \nlogging process.  These healthier, taller, straighter trees yield m ore 2”x8” board-feet than is \ntypical and leads to the advantaged product m ix.  There are no significant econom ies of scale \nto the process. \n \nKey Points \n• The com pany leases land with a signif icantly higher quality of  trees. This leads to a revenue \nadvantage because m ore 2”x8” board-feet can be produced per acre of land.  Additionally, \nthere is a cost advantage because the higher quality inputs m ake the logging process easier \nand increase yields and turnover. \n• Since the leases are for 99 years and renewable, the current situation seem s sustainable. \n• Since it is unlikely that another piece of land sim ilar to this one exists or that another firm  \nwill give up advantaged land, the situation is not replicable."}
{"case_id": "AUTO MANUFACTURER", "case_text": "AUTO MANUFACTURER \n \nBackground: \nYour team  is hired by a large U.S. autom obile m anufacturer (GM).  They are interested in your \nevaluation of their $10B after-m arket parts business.  This business can be segm ented into two \nsets of buyers: dealers authorized to sell GM parts ($8B) and non-dealer m erchandisers ($2B).  \nThis second group can be subdivided into m ass merchandisers and “service” providers.  Mass \nmerchandisers are of two types -- those which specialize in auto parts (e.g. Auto Zone) and those \nwhich sell diverse products including auto parts (e.g. Sears).  “Service” providers include \nGoodyear or W estern Auto.  GM would like for you to answer two questions: (1) Is there an \nopportunity to expand this part of the business?  (2) How would they go about doing it if they \nchose to expand?  \n \nAdditional Details: \n• Com pany Econom ics:  There are trem endous fixed costs in the auto business (including \nlabor).  All of  GM’s parts m anufacturing f acilities are f ully depreciated and they currently \nhave excess capacity. \n• Com petitors:  W hile Ford and Chrysler m ake parts f or their own cars, they are not nearly as \nintegrated as GM and tend to focus in specific parts categories.  There are hundreds of sm all \nparts m anufacturers which tend to focus on com modity-like auto parts (e.g. oil filters). \n• Products:  GM produces a full spectrum  of parts classified as either platform-specific or \nuniversal .  \n  \nPage 82  Platform -specific Parts Universal Parts \nTypes of Parts Body panels , brakes , transm issions , Spark plugs, filters , hoses , engines batteries \nMarket \nCharacteristics Sold through dealers under \nwarranty; high m argins/low volum e Sold through m any outlets; \nhigh turnover; strong \ncompetition; slim  margins/very \nhigh volum e \nGM Sales $8B $2B \n• Growth Rates:  The table below provides the basic facts about each m arket segm ent’s growth \nrate. \nMarket Segm ent Overall Market Growth \nRate Total Market Size \nDealer-authorized -35% per annum  $40B \nNon-dealer   \n• Mass \nmerchandisers +65% per annum  $70B \n• Service \nproviders +15% per annum  $30B \n \nKey Points: (Porter Five Forces analysis) \n• Threat of Entry is m inimal for a broad category because the fixed costs are very high.  \nHowever, a m anufacturer could go after a niche play if it were to develop an advantaged cost \nstructure or superior product.  Switching costs am ong consum ers is very low. \n• Industry Rivalry is im portant for the m ass merchandiser category because m argins are slim  \n(meaning price wars are m ore prevalent).  Brand nam es (e.g. Fram , AC Delco, AutoLite) are \nimportant to m any consum ers. \n• Substitute Products are relevant only in the sense that there are m any com peting products and \nfuture technologies such as electric cars could elim inate the need for m any types of parts. \n• Power of Suppliers is not a significant factor because inputs are com modity raw m etal and \nrubber. \n• Power of Buyers is im portant since there are few m ass merchandisers such as Sears or Km art \nand they dem and  full range of products and trem endous volum e discounts. \nGM’s Position:  GM m ay have a cost advantage due to its fully depreciated plants and excess \ncapacity in a fixed-cost environm ent.  Thus its variable costs m ust be below sales revenue.  Also, \nits brand nam es are respected and are valuable to m erchandisers in m aintaining m argins.  GM’s \nability to produce a full-range of products is also an advantage.  These advantages com bined \nwith the high growth rates for the non-dealer m erchandisers should m otivate GM to expand it \nbusiness in this segm ent.. GM should use its cost advantage, brand nam es, and full range of \nproducts to go after the m ost lucrative m arket -- the m ass merchandisers."}
