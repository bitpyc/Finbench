The Restricted Stock Awards are subject to continued employment over a specified period. The Restricted Stock Awards granted to employees entitle the holders to shares of common stock as the Restricted Stock Awards vest over time, but not to dividends declared on the underlying shares, while the stock subject to the Restricted Stock Awards is unvested. Vesting of the shares underlying the PSUs are also subject to achieving certain specified performance levels during the measurement period subsequent to the date of grant.During the twelve months ended August 31, 2022, we granted 102,682 Restricted Stock Awards of which 71,978 were RSUs and 30,704 were PSUs. The majority of the Restricted Stock Awards granted are related to the annual employee grant on November 1, 2021. From this grant, the RSUs vest ratably over five years on the anniversary of the grant date with the majority of the remaining RSUs granted during fiscal 2022 vesting ratably over three years on the anniversary of the grant date. All PSUs granted in fiscal 2022, including those under the November 1, 2021 grant, cliff vest on the third anniversary of the grant date, subject to the achievement of certain performance metrics. Non-Employee Directors' Restricted Stock UnitsThe Director Plan provides for the grant of stock-based awards, including RSUs, to non-employee directors of FactSet. On January 18, 2022, we granted 1,629 RSUs to our non-employee directors that vest 100% on the first anniversary of the grant date. There were no non-employee director RSU grants in fiscal 2021 and 2020.Employee Stock Purchase PlanShares of FactSet common stock may be purchased by eligible employees under the FactSet Research Systems Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as Amended and Restated (the \"ESPP\") in three-month intervals. The purchase price is equal to 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of our common stock on the first day or the last day of each three-month offering period. Employee purchases may not exceed 10% of their gross compensation and there is a $25,000 contribution limit per employee during an offering period. Shares purchased through the ESPP cannot be sold or otherwise transferred for 18 months after purchase. Dividends paid on shares held in the ESPP are used to purchase additional ESPP shares at the market price on the dividend payment date.During fiscal 2022, employees purchased 36,244 shares at a weighted average price of $332.30 compared with 38,848 shares at a weighted average price of $273.59 in fiscal 2021 and 42,606 shares at a weighted average price of $234.41 in fiscal 2020. Stock-based compensation expense recorded during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 relating to the ESPP was $2.3 million, $2.0 million and $2.1 million, respectively. At August 31, 2022, the ESPP had 102,712 shares reserved for future issuance. The weighted average estimated fair value of the ESPP shares during fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, was $66.35, $54.00 and $50.69 per share.85\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

A base rate review could result in a refund to customers if AEP Texas incurs a disallowance of the transmission or distribution investment on which an interim increase was based. Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses, if any, that are reasonably possible of occurring. A revenue decrease, including a refund of interim transmission and distribution rates, could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. AEP Texas is required to file for a comprehensive rate review no later than April 5, 2024.  \nAPCo and WPCo Rate Matters (Applies to AEP and APCo)  \n2017-2019 Virginia Triennial Review  \nIn November 2020, the Virginia SCC issued an order on APCo’s 2017-2019 Triennial Review filing concluding that APCo earned above its authorized ROE but within its ROE band for the 2017-2019 period, resulting in no refund to customers and no change to APCo base rates on a prospective basis. The Virginia SCC approved a prospective 9.2% ROE for APCo's 2020-2022 triennial review period with the continuation of a 140 basis point band (8.5% bottom, 9.2% midpoint, 9.9% top).   \nIn December 2020, an intervenor filed a petition at the Virginia SCC requesting reconsideration of: (a) the failure of the Virginia SCC to apply a threshold earnings test to the approved regulatory asset for APCo’s closed coal-fired generation assets and (b) the Virginia SCC’s use of a 2011 benchmark study to measure the replacement value of capacity for purposes of APCo’s 2017 – 2019 earnings test.  \nIn December 2020, APCo filed a petition at the Virginia SCC requesting reconsideration of: (a) certain issues related to APCo’s going-forward rates and (b) the Virginia SCC’s decision to deny APCo tariff changes that align rates with underlying costs. For APCo’s going-forward rates, APCo requested that the Virginia SCC clarify its final order and clarify whether APCo’s current rates will allow it to earn a fair return. If the Virginia SCC’s order did conclude that APCo was able to earn a fair return through existing base rates, APCo further requested that the Virginia SCC clarify whether it has the authority to also permit an increase in base rates.  \nIn March 2021, an intervenor filed its appeal with the Virginia Supreme Court related to the November 2020 order in which it stated the Virginia SCC erred: (a) in determining that Virginia law did not apply to its determination to permit amortization for recovery of costs associated with retired coal-fired generation assets, (b) in establishing a new regulatory asset for a cost incurred outside of the triennial review period due to its failure to apply a threshold earnings test before approving deferred cost recovery and (c) in misapplying the requirement that APCo bear the burden of demonstrating that power purchases made by APCo from its affiliate, OVEC, were priced at the lower of OVEC’s cost or the market price for nonaffiliated power.  \nIn March 2021, APCo filed its appeal with the Virginia Supreme Court related to the November 2020 order in which it stated the Virginia SCC erred: (a) in finding that costs associated with asset impairments related to early retirement determinations made by APCo for certain generation facilities should not be attributed to the test periods under review and deemed fully recovered in the period recorded, (b) in finding that it was permitted to evaluate the reasonableness of APCo’s decision to record, per books for financial reporting purposes, asset impairments related to early retirement determinations for certain generation facilities, (c) as a result of the errors described in (a) and (b), in denying APCo an increase in rates, (d) in failing to review and make any findings regarding whether APCo’s rates would allow it to earn a fair rate of return going forward, (e) in denying APCo an increase in base rates by failing to ensure that APCo has an opportunity to recover its costs and earn a fair rate of return, thereby resulting in a taking of private property for public use without just compensation and (f) in retroactively adjusting APCo’s depreciation expense for purposes of calculating APCo’s earnings for the 2017-2019 triennial period. 158\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

Adjustments to depreciation expense in any re-billing under the Unit Power Sales Agreement formula rate will also involve changes to accumulated depreciation, accumulated deferred income taxes, and other formula elements as needed. In October 2019 the LPSC filed rebuttal testimony increasing the amount of refunds sought for liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions.  The LPSC seeks approximately $512 million plus interest, which is approximately $216 million through December 31, 2021.  The FERC trial staff also filed rebuttal testimony in which it seeks refunds of a similar amount as the LPSC for the liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions.  The LPSC testimony also argued that adjustments to depreciation rates should affect rate base on a prospective basis only.  \nA hearing was held before a FERC ALJ in November 2019. In April 2020 the ALJ issued the initial decision. Among other things, the ALJ determined that refunds were due on three main issues. First, with regard to the lease renewal payments, the ALJ determined that System Energy is recovering an unjust acquisition premium through the lease renewal payments, and that System Energy’s recovery from customers through rates should be limited to the cost of service based on the remaining net book value of the leased assets, which is approximately $70 million. The ALJ found that the remedy for this issue should be the refund of lease payments (approximately $17.2 million per year since July 2015) with interest determined at the FERC quarterly interest rate, which would be offset by the addition of the net book value of the leased assets in the cost of service. The ALJ did not calculate a value for the refund expected as a result of this remedy. In addition, System Energy would no longer recover the lease payments in rates prospectively. Second, with regard to the liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions, the ALJ determined that the liabilities are accumulated deferred income taxes and that System Energy’s rate base should have been reduced for those liabilities. If the ALJ’s initial decision is upheld, the estimated refund for this issue through December 31, 2021, is approximately $422 million, plus interest, which is approximately $128 million through December 31, 2021. The ALJ also found that System Energy should include liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as a rate base reduction going forward. Third, with regard to the depreciation expense adjustments, the ALJ found that System Energy should correct for the error in re-billings retroactively and prospectively, but that System Energy should not be permitted to recover interest on any retroactive return on enhanced rate base resulting from such corrections. If the initial decision is affirmed on this issue, System Energy estimates refunds of approximately $19 million, which includes interest through December 31, 2021.  \nThe ALJ initial decision is an interim step in the FERC litigation process, and an ALJ’s determinations made in an initial decision are not controlling on the FERC. The ALJ in the initial decision acknowledges that these are issues of first impression before the FERC. In June 2020, System Energy, the LPSC, and the FERC trial staff filed briefs on exceptions, challenging several of the initial decision’s findings. System Energy’s brief on exceptions challenged the initial decision’s limitations on recovery of the lease renewal payments, its proposed rate base refund for the liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions, and its proposal to asymmetrically treat interest on bill corrections for depreciation expense adjustments. The LPSC’s and the FERC trial staff’s briefs on exceptions each challenged the initial decision’s allowance for recovery of the cost of service associated with the lease renewal based on the remaining net book value of the leased assets, its calculation of the remaining net book value of the leased assets, and the amount of the initial decision’s proposed rate base refund for the liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions. The LPSC’s brief on exceptions also challenged the initial decision’s proposal that depreciation expense adjustments include retroactive adjustments to rate base and its finding that section 203 of the Federal Power Act did not apply to the lease renewal. The FERC trial staff’s brief on exceptions also challenged the initial decision’s finding that the FERC need not institute a formal investigation into System Energy’s tariff. In October 2020, System Energy, the LPSC, the MPSC, the APSC, and the City Council filed briefs opposing exceptions. System Energy opposed the exceptions filed by the LPSC and the FERC trial staff. The LPSC, MPSC, APSC, City Council, and the FERC trial staff opposed the exceptions filed by System Energy. Also in October 2020 the MPSC, APSC, and the City Council filed briefs adopting the exceptions of the LPSC and the FERC trial staff. The case is pending before the FERC, which will review the case and issue an order on the proceeding, and the FERC may accept, reject, or modify the ALJ’s initial decision in whole or in part. Refunds, if any, that might be required will only become due after the FERC issues its order reviewing the initial decision.98\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}
{"question": "Principal", "answer": "500.0", "task": "SEC-NUM", "context": "\n  \nNote 11 – DebtIn conjunction with the Acquisition, the Company acquired $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of Maxim’s 3.375% senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes due March 15, 2023 (the Maxim March 2023 Notes). On November 4, 2021, the Maxim March 2023 Notes were redeemed for cash at a redemption price equal to $1,038.23 for each $1,000 principal amount.Note 12 – Income TaxesThe Company’s effective tax rates for the three-month periods ended January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021 were below the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21.0%, due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to the Company's operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which it earns income. In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company increased acquisition related tax reserves by $25.3 million consisting of $21.8 million in tax and $3.5 million in accrued interest primarily relating to tax audits. The Company engages in continuous discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued interest and penalties, could decrease by as much as $146.0 million within the next twelve months due to the completion of tax audits, including any administrative appeals. The Company has numerous audits ongoing throughout the world including: an IRS income tax audit for the fiscal years ended November 3, 2018 and November 2, 2019; a pre-acquisition IRS income tax audit for Maxim's fiscal years ended June 27, 2015 through June 24, 2017; various U.S. state and local audits and various international audits. The Company's U.S. federal tax returns prior to the fiscal year ended November 3, 2018 are no longer subject to examination, except for the Maxim pre-Acquisition fiscal years 2015 to 2017 noted above.Note 13 – New Accounting PronouncementsStandards ImplementedReference Rate ReformIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) - Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, which provides optional guidance for accounting for contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform, if certain criteria are met. The provisions of this standard are available for election through December 31, 2022. The Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 with no material impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations.Standards to Be ImplementedAcquired Contract Assets and Contract LiabilitiesIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Acquired Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities. Under the new guidance (ASC 805-20-30-28), the acquirer should determine what contract assets and/or contract liabilities it would have recorded under ASC 606 (the revenue guidance) as of the acquisition date, as if the acquirer had entered into the original contract at the same date and on the same terms as the acquiree. The recognition and measurement of those contract assets and contract liabilities will likely be comparable to what the acquiree has recorded on its books under ASC 606 as of the acquisition date. ASU 2021-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. ASU 2021-08 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of the fiscal year ended November 1, 2024. Early adoption is permitted, including in an interim period, for any period for which financial statements have not yet been issued. However, adoption in an interim period other than the first fiscal quarter requires an entity to apply the new guidance to all prior business combinations that have occurred since the beginning of the annual period in which the new guidance is adopted. The Company is currently evaluating the adoption date of ASU 2021-08 and the impact, if any, adoption will have on its financial position and results of operations.Note 14 – AcquisitionsMaxim Integrated Products, Inc.On the Acquisition Date, the Company completed its acquisition of all of the voting interests of Maxim, an independent manufacturer of innovative analog and mixed-signal products and technologies. The total consideration paid to acquire Maxim, which consisted of cash, common stock of the Company and share-based compensation awards, was approximately $28.0 billion.

{"question": "Unrecognized compensation costs related to non-vested awards", "answer": "35", "task": "SEC-NUM", "context": "\n  \nNOTE 17 – Share-Based Associate Compensation PlansFour equity compensation plans currently permit us to grant various types of equity awards. We currently grant incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, service-based restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units to associates, including some with market-based performance objectives under our shareholder-approved plans. We also have a Holiday Stock Plan that permits annual awards of one share of common stock to each full-time associate for each full calendar year of service up to a maximum of 10 shares. One of our equity compensation plans permits us to grant stock to our outside directors as a component of their annual compensation. We used treasury shares for share-based compensation award issues or exercises during 2021 and 2020.  \nShare-based compensation cost after tax was $26 million, $25 million and $24 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The related income tax benefit recognized was $6 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, had intrinsic value of $24 million, $15 million and $26 million, respectively. Intrinsic value is the market price less the exercise price. Options vested during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, had total intrinsic value of $15 million, $7 million and $23 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had $35 million of unrecognized total compensation cost related to nonvested stock options and restricted stock unit awards. That cost will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.8 years. Stock OptionsStock options are granted to associates at an exercise price equal to the fair value as determined by the average high and low sales price reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market for the grant date and are exercisable over 10-year periods. The stock options generally vest ratably over a three-year period. In determining the share-based compensation amounts, we estimate the fair value of each option granted on the date of grant using the Black Scholes pricing model. We make the following assumptions to develop the Black Scholes pricing model as follows:•Weighted-average expected term is based on historical experience of similar awards with consideration for current exercise trends.•Expected volatility is based on our stock price over a historical period that approximates the expected term.•Dividend yield is determined by dividing the annualized per share dividend by the stock price on the date of grant.•Risk-free rates are the implied yield currently available on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury issues with a remaining term approximating the expected term.

The accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgments regarding expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocations of those cash flows to identifiable tangible and intangible assets, in determining the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, are based on management’s best estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. The estimates and assumptions underlying the initial valuations are subject to the collection of information necessary to complete the valuations within the measurement periods, which are up to one year from the respective acquisition dates. The preliminary purchase price allocations that are not finalized as of December 31, 2021 relate to the final assessment of the fair values of intangible assets (primarily customer relationship intangible assets) and property, plant and equipment associated with the acquisitions we closed in 2021.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | IRON MOUNTAIN 2021 FORM 10-K | 98 |\n\n\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

Prior to the acquisition date, the Company accounted for its 49% interest in Anviti as an equity-method investment.

Income TaxesWe have maintained and intend to maintain our election as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In order for us to continue to qualify as a REIT we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute annual dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90% of our adjusted taxable income. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate level to the extent such income is distributed to our shareholders annually. If our taxable income exceeds our dividends in a tax year, REIT tax rules allow us to designate dividends from the subsequent tax year in order to avoid current taxation on undistributed income. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we may be subject to federal and state income taxes for such year. In addition, we may not be able to requalify as a REIT for the four subsequent taxable years and may be subject to federal and state income taxes in those years as well. Historically, we have incurred only state and local income, franchise, and excise taxes. Taxable income from non-REIT activities managed through taxable REIT subsidiaries is subject to applicable federal, state, and local income taxes. Our consolidated operating partnerships are flow-through entities and are not subject to federal income taxes at the entity level.We have recorded income, franchise, sales, and excise taxes in the condensed consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 as income tax expense. Income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 primarily related to state income tax and federal taxes on the taxable income of certain of our taxable REIT subsidiaries. We have no significant temporary or permanent differences or tax credits associated with our taxable REIT subsidiaries.We believe we have no uncertain tax positions or unrecognized tax benefits requiring disclosure as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. 13.

As of December 31, 2021, there were deferred tax assets before valuation allowances of approximately $299.1 million related to foreign net operating losses (NOLs). The majority of the foreign NOLs carryforward indefinitely. In certain foreign jurisdictions NOLs expire each year beginning in 2021. The utilization of NOLs may be subject to certain limitations under U.S. federal, state and foreign laws. We have recorded a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets where we believe that it is more likely than not that the NOLs will not be utilized.We determined that as of December 31, 2021, $273.3 million of deferred tax assets do not satisfy the realization criteria set forth in Topic 740. Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been recorded for this amount. If released, the entire amount would result in a benefit to continuing operations. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our valuation allowance decreased by approximately $17.8 million. The decrease was attributed to a reversal of the beginning of year valuation allowance of $12.3 million as certain foreign subsidiaries expect to utilize deferred tax assets before expiration as a result of current and forecasted earnings within the applicable jurisdiction, a reduction of $19.5 million due to foreign currency translation and tax rate changes, and an increase in valuation allowance of $14.0 million due to current year activities. We believe it is more likely than not that future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets recorded as of December 31, 2021, net of valuation allowance.At December 31, 2021, we have undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries of approximately $4.4 billion for which we have indefinitely reinvested and not recognized deferred taxes. Estimating the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax is not practicable due to the complexity and variety of assumptions necessary to estimate the tax. In 2021, following the acquisition of Turner & Townsend, we recorded $20.4 million of deferred tax liability related to book over tax basis difference in Turner & Townsend. The deferred tax liability was offset by an increase to goodwill in purchase accounting and therefore did not impact 2021 income tax expense.The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was approximately $191.9 million and $168.5 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect our effective tax rate, if recognized, is $108.5 million as of December 31, 2021. 106\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

As of December 31, 2021, Expedia Group maintained a $1.145 billion revolving credit facility with a group of lenders that expires on May 31, 2023 (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). Obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries that guarantee the facility (subject to certain exceptions, including for our headquarters located in Seattle, WA) up to the maximum amount permitted under the indentures governing the Senior Notes without securing such Senior Notes. Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a per annum rate equal to an index rate plus a margin depending on the Company's credit ratings (A) in the case of eurocurrency loans ranging from 1.00% to 1.75% , and (B) in the case of base rate loans, at rates ranging from 0.00% to 0.75%. The Revolving Credit Facility contains certain financial covenants, including a leverage ratio test. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had no Revolving Credit Facility borrowings outstanding. The amount of stand-by letters of credit (“LOC”) issued under the Revolving Credit Facility reduced the credit amount available. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, there was $14 million and $13 million of outstanding stand-by LOCs issued under the facility.Foreign Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2021, the Company and Expedia Group International Holdings III, LLC (the “Borrower”) also maintained an $855 million credit facility with a group of lenders that expires on May 31, 2023 (the “Foreign Credit Facility”). Obligations under the Foreign Credit Facility are unsecured. Such obligations are guaranteed by the Company, its subsidiaries that guarantee obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, as mentioned above, and certain of the Company’s additional subsidiaries. Loans under the Foreign Credit Facility bear interest at a per annum rate equal to an index rate plus a margin depending on the Company’s credit ratings (A) in the case of eurocurrency loans, ranging from 1.25% to 2.00%, and (B) in the case of base rate loans, ranging from 0.25% to per 1.00%. The covenants, events of default and other terms and conditions in the Foreign Credit Facility are substantially similar to those in the Revolving Credit Facility, but include additional limitations on the Borrower and certain other entities that are not obligors under the Revolving Credit Facility.As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had no Foreign Credit Facility borrowings outstanding.NOTE 8 — Employee Benefit PlansOur U.S. employees are generally eligible to participate in a retirement and savings plan that qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Participating employees may contribute up to 50% of their pretax salary, but not more than statutory limits. We contribute fifty cents for each dollar a participant contributes in this plan, with a maximum contribution of 3% of a participant’s earnings. Our contribution vests with the employee after the employee completes two years of service. Participating employees have the option to invest in our common stock, but there is no requirement for participating employees to invest their contribution or our matching contribution in our common stock. We also have various defined contribution plans for our international employees. Our contributions to these benefit plans were $68 million, $63 million and $81 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.NOTE 9 — Stock-Based Awards and Other Equity Instruments Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Expedia Group, Inc. 2005 Stock and Annual Incentive Plan, we may grant restricted stock, restricted stock awards, RSUs, stock options and other stock-based awards, such as PSUs, to directors, officers, employees and consultants.

Shares of common stock repurchased under the Share Repurchase Program become treasury shares. Repurchases of our common stock under the Share Repurchase Program may be made from time to time, on the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or by other methods, at our discretion, and in accordance with the limitations set forth in Rule 10b-18 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and other applicable federal and state laws and regulations.On August 1, 2022, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (“JP Morgan”) to repurchase up to$700.0 million of our common stock on an accelerated basis through September 29, 2022. On August 3, 2022, we paid $700.0 million to JP Morgan and received an initial delivery of approximately 3.0 million shares of common stock. The final notional amount under the ASR agreement was $557.7 million or approximately 6.6 million shares of our common stock based on the daily average volume-weighted average price of our common stock during the term of the ASR for the period from August 1, 2022 to August 31, 2022, less a discount. The ASR agreement concluded on September 1, 2022.The ASR was a forward contract indexed to our own common stock. The forward contract met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification, so we did not account for it as a derivative instrument. We have reflected the shares delivered to us by the financial institution as treasury shares as of the dates they were delivered to us in computing weighted average shares outstanding for both basic and diluted net income per share.Repurchased shares of our common stock are held as treasury shares until they are reissued or retired. We have not yet determined the ultimate disposition of repurchased shares and consequently we continue to hold them as treasury shares rather than retiring them. Future stock repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program are at the discretion of our management, and authorization of future stock repurchase programs is subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors. The Share Repurchase Program does not obligate us to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares, and the program may be extended, modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 9. Business Segment and Geographic Information |\n\nReportable SegmentsAn operating segment is identified as a component of a business that has discrete financial information available and for which the chief operating decision maker must decide the level of resource allocation. In addition, the guidance for segment reporting indicates certain quantitative materiality thresholds. None of the components of our business meet the definition of an operating segment.We currently consider our operations to be, and manage our business globally within, one reportable segment, which is consistent with how our President and Chief Executive Officer, who is our chief operating decision maker, reviews our business, makes investment and resource allocation decisions, and assesses operating performance.Disaggregation of Revenue We disaggregate revenue by geographic region and by major sales channel. We have determined that disaggregating revenue into these categories achieves the ASC Topic 606 disclosure objectives of depicting how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.Dexcom is domiciled in the United States. We sell our CGM systems through a direct sales force in the North America, Asia Pacific, Europe, and the Middle East, and through distribution arrangements in the United States, and certain countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East, as well as Australia, Canada, and New Zealand.28\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

The release in the allowance for credit losses between March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, was primarily driven by the continued strength of the loan portfolio's credit performance.In estimating the allowance at March 31, 2022, the Company used a macroeconomic forecast that projected (i) a peak unemployment rate of 5.2%, decreasing to 4.9% and 3.5% through the end of 2022 and 2023, respectively; and (ii) 3.1% and 2.2% annualized growth in the real gross domestic product for 2022 and 2023, respectively. Labor market conditions, which historically have been an important determinant of credit loss trends, continued to improve as of March 31, 2022. The unemployment rate and continuing jobless claims returned to pre-pandemic levels during the first quarter of 2022, and the number of job openings reached near-record levels, reflecting robust demand for labor as the U.S. economy continues to expand post pandemic.In estimating expected credit losses, the Company considered the uncertainties associated with borrower behavior, payment trends and credit performance subsequent to the expiration of government stimulus programs and disaster relief programs, as well as higher consumer price inflation experienced in the first quarter of 2022 and the fiscal and monetary policy responses to that inflation. The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark federal funds rate in March 2022 and signaled additional rate hikes in 2022. In recognition of the evolving macroeconomic environment, the estimation of the allowance for credit losses has required significant management judgment.The forecast period the Company deemed to be reasonable and supportable was 18 months for all periods presented. The 18-month reasonable and supportable forecast period was deemed appropriate based on the observed stability of the economic outlook and relative consistency among the macroeconomic forecasts. For all periods presented, the Company determined that a reversion period of 12 months was appropriate for similar reasons. Due to the uncertainties associated with borrower behavior resulting from government stimulus, disaster relief programs and fiscal and monetary policies, the 12\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of these acquisitions were not material to Autodesk’s Consolidated Financial Statements.  \nUpchain  \nOn May 11, 2021, Autodesk acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Upchain Inc. (“Upchain”), a cloud-based provider of product lifecycle management and product data management systems, for approximately $126.7 million in cash and Autodesk will issue a fixed amount of $13.1 million in common stock at future dates to certain employees in connection with the acquisition for a total consideration of $139.8 million. Of the total consideration transferred, $123.6 million is considered purchase consideration. Of the remaining amount, $13.1 million is accounted for as liability-classified awards and recognized as compensation expense using the straight-line method over the vesting period, and $3.1 million was recorded as stock-based compensation expense during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022. Issuance of the $13.1 million fixed value in common stock is dependent on the respective employees’ continued employment and vests 40% and 60% on the first and second anniversaries of the closing date, respectively. The number of shares will be determined based on the VWAP of Autodesk’s common stock for the ninety consecutive trading day period ending on the release date. The number of shares is estimated to be 48,000 based on the VWAP of Autodesk’s common stock for the ninety consecutive trading day period ending January 31, 2022, the last trading day of the fiscal quarter. See also Note 4, “Equity Compensation”.  \nAutodesk expects to integrate Upchain’s unified cloud platform in Autodesk solutions to centralize data management and process management.   \nInnovyze  \nOn March 31, 2021, Autodesk acquired all of the outstanding stock of Storm UK Holdco Limited, the parent of Innovyze, Inc. (“Innovyze”), a global leader in water infrastructure software. Innovyze is expected to provide comprehensive water modeling solutions that augment Autodesk’s BIM offerings in civil engineering, and is expected to extend Autodesk’s presence into operations and maintenance of water infrastructure assets.  \nThe acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred totaled $1,038.1 million, which consisted of $1,035.5 million of cash and 9,277 shares of Autodesk’s restricted common stock at an aggregate fair value of $2.6 million. Of the total consideration transferred, $1,035.5 million is considered purchase consideration. The remaining amount of $2.6 million was recorded in “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” and “Long-term other assets”. The 9,277 shares of restricted common stock are subject to forfeiture until the second anniversary of the acquisition closing date. 50% are released from restriction on both the first and second anniversaries subject to continued employment. See also Note 4, “Equity Compensation”.  \nOther Acquisitions  \nDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, Autodesk completed four additional business combinations. The acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred totaled $113.3 million, which consisted of $98.8 million of cash, a fixed amount of $10.6 million in common stock to be issued at future dates to certain employees in connection with the acquisition, 12,782 shares of Autodesk’s restricted common stock at an aggregate fair value of $3.5 million, and $0.4 million of assumed liabilities on behalf of the sellers.

The Company recognized a gain of approximately $65 million in connection with the sale.During the first quarter of 2021, the Company completed leasehold and property acquisitions, primarily in the Permian Basin, for total cash consideration of $2 million. The Company also completed the sale of certain non-core assets and leasehold, primarily in the Permian Basin, in multiple transactions for total cash proceeds of $3 million.

CAPITALIZED EXPLORATORY WELL COSTSThe Company’s capitalized exploratory well costs were $466 million and $321 million as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The increase is primarily attributable to additional drilling activity in Suriname and Egypt. Projects with suspended exploratory well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year since the completion of drilling are those identified by management as exhibiting sufficient quantities of hydrocarbons to justify potential development. Management is actively pursuing efforts to assess whether proved reserves can be attributed to these projects.4.    DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIESObjectives and StrategiesThe Company is exposed to fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on the majority of its worldwide production, as well as fluctuations in exchange rates in connection with transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The Company manages the variability in its cash flows by occasionally entering into derivative transactions on a portion of its crude oil and natural gas production and foreign currency transactions. The Company utilizes various types of derivative financial instruments, including forward contracts, futures contracts, swaps, and options, to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in commodity prices or foreign currency values.Counterparty RiskThe use of derivative instruments exposes the Company to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty. To reduce the concentration of exposure to any individual counterparty, the Company utilizes a diversified group of investment-grade rated counterparties, primarily financial institutions, for its derivative transactions. As of June 30, 2022, the Company had derivative positions with 12 counterparties. The Company monitors counterparty creditworthiness on an ongoing basis; however, it cannot predict sudden changes in counterparties’ creditworthiness. In addition, even if such changes are not sudden, the Company may be limited in its ability to mitigate an increase in counterparty credit risk. Should one of these counterparties not perform, the Company may not realize the benefit of some of its derivative instruments resulting from lower commodity prices or changes in currency exchange rates. 12\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

The final determination of the taxes in respect of the Separation and the Distribution for which the Company is responsible pursuant to the 21CF Disney Merger Agreement and a prepayment of the estimated taxes in respect of divestitures (collectively, the \"Transaction Tax\") was $6.5 billion. Following the Distribution, on March 20, 2019 the Company received a cash payment in the amount of $2.0 billion from Disney, which had the net effect of reducing the Dividend the Company paid to 21CF. The Transaction Tax included a prepayment of the Company's share of the estimated tax liabilities resulting from the anticipated divestitures by Disney of certain assets, principally the FOX Sports Regional Sports Networks (\"RSNs\"), which were sold by Disney during calendar year 2019 (\"Divestiture Tax\"). This prepayment was in the amount of approximately $700 million. During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company and Disney reached an agreement to settle the majority of the prepaid Divestiture Tax and the Company received $462 million from Disney as reimbursement of the Company's prepayment based upon the sales price of the RSNs. This reimbursement was recorded in Other, net in the Statement of Operations (See Note 20—Additional Financial Information under the heading \"Other, net\"). The balance of the prepaid Divestiture Tax is subject to adjustment in the future, but any such adjustment is not expected to have a material impact on the results of the Company.As a result of the Separation and the Distribution, which was a taxable transaction for which the estimated tax liability of $5.8 billion was included in the Transaction Tax paid by the Company, FOX obtained a tax basis in its assets equal to their respective fair market values. This will result in estimated annual tax deductions of approximately $1.5 billion, principally over the next several years related to the amortization of the additional tax basis. This amortization is estimated to reduce the Company's annual cash tax liability by approximately $370 million per year at the current combined federal and state applicable tax rate of approximately 25%. Such estimates are subject to revisions, which could be material, based upon the occurrence of future events.The consolidated financial statements are referred to as the \"Financial Statements\" herein.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESPrinciples of consolidationThe Financial Statements include the accounts of all majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries. In addition, the Company evaluates its relationships with other entities to identify whether they are variable interest entities as defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 810-10, \"Consolidation\" (\"ASC 810-10\") and whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. Consolidation is required if both of these criteria are met. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions within the Company's consolidated businesses have been eliminated in consolidation.Any change in the Company's ownership interest in a consolidated subsidiary, where a controlling financial interest is retained, is accounted for as an equity transaction. When the Company ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a consolidated subsidiary, the Company will recognize a gain or loss in net income upon deconsolidation.The Company's fiscal year ends on June 30 (\"fiscal\") of each year.Reclassifications and adjustmentsCertain fiscal 2021 and 2020 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2022 presentation.Use of estimatesThe preparation of the Company's Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the 69\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

Insurance subsidiaries’ statutory capital and surplus necessary to satisfy regulatory requirements in the aggregate was $563 million at December 31, 2021. More information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends can be found in Note 12—Shareholders' Equity. The Company's statutory financial statements are presented on the basis of accounting practices prescribed by the insurance department of the state of domicile of each insurance subsidiary. While all states have adopted the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ (NAIC) statutory accounting practices (NAIC SAP) as the basis for statutory accounting, certain states have retained prescribed practices of their respective insurance code or administrative code which can differ from NAIC SAP. For Globe Life's life insurance companies, there are no significant differences between NAIC SAP and the accounting practices prescribed by the states of domicile.  \n73 GL 2021 FORM 10-K\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

Our operations are conducted in two reporting business segments: Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. We define our segments as those operations whose results our CODM regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. We measure the results of our segments using, among other measures, each segment’s net sales, gross profit and operating income. The CODM reviews these metrics for each of our reporting segments. We may revise the measurement of each segment’s operating income, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by the CODM. If the measurement of a segment changes, prior period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period’s presentation. Corporate, support and Other consists primarily of store support center costs that are considered shared services and therefore these selling, general and administrative costs are excluded from our two reporting business segments. These costs include operating expenses for our store support center and the results of operations for our Summit Pointe property in Chesapeake, Virginia.

Debt FacilitiesTerm Credit AgreementIn connection with the acquisition of Shape, on January 24, 2020, the Company entered into a Term Credit Agreement (\"Term Credit Agreement\") with certain institutional lenders that provides for a senior unsecured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million (the \"Term Loan Facility\"). The proceeds from the Term Loan Facility were primarily used to finance the acquisition of Shape and related expenses. In connection with the Term Loan Facility, the Company incurred $2.2 million in debt issuance costs, which are recorded as a reduction to the carrying value of the principal amount of the debt. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at the Company's option, (a) LIBOR, adjusted for customary statutory reserves, plus an applicable margin of 1.125% to 1.75% depending on the Company's leverage ratio, or (b) an alternate base rate determined in accordance with the Term Credit Agreement, plus an applicable margin of 0.125% to 0.750% depending on the Company's leverage ratio. Interest on the outstanding principal of borrowings is currently due quarterly in arrears. As of December 31, 2021, the margin for LIBOR-based loans was 1.125% and the margin for alternate base rate loans was 0.125%.The Term Loan Facility matures on January 24, 2023 with quarterly installments (commencing with the first full fiscal quarter ended after January 24, 2020) equal to 1.25% of the original principal amount of the Term Loan Facility. The remaining outstanding principal of borrowings under the Term Loan Facility is due upon maturity on January 24, 2023. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility may be voluntarily prepaid, in whole or in part, without penalty or premium. Borrowings repaid or prepaid under the Term Loan Facility may not be reborrowed.  Among certain affirmative and negative covenants provided in the Term Credit Agreement, there is a financial covenant that requires the Company to maintain a leverage ratio, calculated as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA. This covenant may result in a higher interest rate on its outstanding principal borrowings on the Term Loan Facility in future periods, depending on the Company's performance. As of December 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with all covenants.As of December 31, 2021, $365.0 million of principal amount under the Term Loan Facility was outstanding, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs of $0.8 million. The weighted average interest rate on the principal amount under the Term Loan Facility outstanding balance was 1.282% and 1.390% for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The following table presents the scheduled principal maturities as of December 31, 2021 (in thousands): \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Fiscal Years Ending September 30: |  | Amount |\n| 2022 (remainder) |  | $ | 15,000  |  |\n| 2023 |  | 350,000  |  |\n| Total |  | $ | 365,000  |  |\n\nRevolving Credit AgreementOn January 31, 2020, the Company entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement (the \"Revolving Credit Agreement\") that provides for a senior unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $350.0 million (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\"). The Company has the option to increase commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility from time to time, subject to certain conditions, by up to $150.0 million. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at the Company's option, (a) LIBOR, adjusted for customary statutory reserves, plus an applicable margin of 1.125% to 1.75% depending on the Company's leverage ratio, or (b) an alternate base rate determined in accordance with the Revolving Credit Agreement, plus an applicable margin of 0.125% to 0.750% depending on the Company's leverage ratio. The Revolving Credit Agreement also requires payment of a commitment fee calculated at a rate per annum of 0.125% to 0.300% depending on the Company's leverage ratio on the undrawn portion of the Revolving Credit Facility.

The Canopy Equity Method Investment makes up the Canopy segment.  \nIn the Beer segment, our portfolio consists of high-end imported beer brands, craft beer, and ABAs. We have an exclusive perpetual brand license to import, market, and sell our Mexican beer portfolio in the U.S. In the Wine and Spirits segment, we sell a portfolio that includes higher-margin, higher-growth wine brands complemented by certain higher-end spirits brands. Amounts included in the Corporate Operations and Other segment consist of costs of executive management, corporate development, corporate finance, corporate growth and strategy, human resources, internal audit, investor relations, legal, public relations, and information technology, as well as our investments made through our corporate venture capital function. All costs included in the Corporate Operations and Other segment are general costs that are applicable to the consolidated group and are, therefore, not allocated to the other reportable segments. All costs reported within the Corporate Operations and Other segment are not included in our CODM’s evaluation of the operating income (loss) performance of the other reportable segments. The business segments reflect how our operations are managed, how resources are allocated, how operating performance is evaluated by senior management, and the structure of our internal financial reporting. Long-lived tangible assets and total asset information by segment is not provided to, or reviewed by, our CODM as it is not used to make strategic decisions, allocate resources, or assess performance.  \nIn addition, management excludes Comparable Adjustments from its evaluation of the results of each operating segment as these Comparable Adjustments are not reflective of core operations of the segments.

{"question": "Percentage of assets depreciated under the group-life method", "answer": "86", "task": "SEC-NUM", "context": "\nCSX CORPORATION  \nPART IIItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNOTE 6.  Properties, continued  \nDepreciation MethodThe depreciable assets of the Company are depreciated using either the group-life or straight-line method of accounting, which are both acceptable depreciation methods in accordance with GAAP. The Company depreciates its railroad assets, including main-line track, locomotives and freight cars, using the group-life method. Assets depreciated under the group-life method comprise 86% of total fixed assets of $46.5 billion on a gross basis as of December 2021. The remaining depreciable assets of the Company, including non-railroad assets and assets under finance leases, are depreciated using the straight-line method on a per asset basis. Land is not depreciated.  \n    The group-life method aggregates assets with similar lives and characteristics into groups and depreciates each of these groups as a whole. When using the group-life method, an underlying assumption is that each group of assets, as a whole, is used and depreciated to the end of its group’s recoverable life. The Company currently utilizes different depreciable asset categories to account for depreciation expense for the railroad assets that are depreciated under the group-life method. By utilizing various depreciable categories, the Company can more accurately account for the use of its assets.  All assets of the Company are depreciated on a time or life basis.  \nThe group-life method of depreciation closely approximates the straight-line method of depreciation. Additionally, due to the nature of most of its assets (e.g. track is one contiguous, connected asset), the Company believes that this is the most accurate and effective way to properly depreciate its assets.  \nEstimated Useful Life    Management performs a review of depreciation expense and useful lives on a regular basis. Under the group-life method, the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic depreciation studies and applying management’s methods to determine the service lives of its properties. A depreciation study is the periodic review of asset service lives, salvage values, accumulated depreciation, and other related factors for group assets conducted by a third-party specialist, analyzed by the Company’s management and approved by the STB, the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over railroad practices. The STB requires depreciation studies be performed every three years for equipment assets (e.g., locomotives and freight cars) and every six years for road and track assets (e.g., bridges, signals, rail, ties, and ballast). The Company believes the frequency of depreciation studies currently required by the STB, complemented by annual data reviews conducted by a third-party specialist and analyzed by the Company's management, provides adequate review of asset service lives and that a more frequent review would not result in a material change due to the long-lived nature of most of the assets.   \n    The Company completed a depreciation study for its road and track assets in 2020 and for equipment assets in 2019, both of which resulted in changes to accumulated depreciation, service lives, salvage values, and other related factors for certain assets. Recent experience with depreciation studies has resulted in changes to accumulated depreciation and depreciation rates that did not materially affect the Company's depreciation expense of $1.4 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Stock-Based CompensationThe Brown-Forman 2013 Omnibus Compensation Plan (Plan) is our incentive compensation plan, designed to reward participants (including eligible officers, employees, and non-employee directors) for company performance. Under the Plan, we can grant stock-based incentive awards for up to 20,750,000 shares of common stock to eligible participants until July 28, 2023. As of April 30, 2022, awards for approximately 12,412,000 shares remain available for issuance under the Plan. We try to limit the source of shares delivered to participants under the Plan to treasury shares that we purchase from time to time on the open market (in connection with a publicly announced share repurchase program), in private transactions, or otherwise.Awards granted under the Plan include stock-settled stock appreciation rights (SSARs), performance-based restricted stock units (PBRSUs), and deferred stock units (DSUs).SSARs. We grant SSARs at an exercise price equal to the closing market price of the underlying stock on the grant date.

{"question": "Percentage deterioration of the official Peso to USD exchange rate", "answer": "10", "task": "SEC-NUM", "context": "\n[Table of Contents](#i6603aeb911854ef785a9b575909b38eb_7)NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  \nBasis of PresentationThe accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair statement of the results for interim periods have been included. Results for interim periods should not be considered indicative of results for a full year. These interim Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto contained in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, collectively referred to as the “2021 Annual Report.” The interim Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the company and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is maintained.   \nSince 2018, Argentina has been considered a hyper-inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP and therefore the U.S. Dollar (“USD”) is the functional currency for our related subsidiaries. Argentina contributes approximately 5 percent to both the company's annual Sales and EBITDA. We remeasure net monetary assets and translate our financial statements utilizing the official Argentine Peso (“Peso”) to USD exchange rate. The ability to draw down Peso cash balances is limited at this time due to government restrictions and market availability of U.S. Dollars. The devaluation of the Peso relative to the USD over the last several years has resulted in the recognition of exchange losses (refer to Note 5 – Supplementary Information, to the interim Consolidated Financial Statements, and Note 9 – Supplemental Information, to the company's 2021 Annual Report). As of September 30, 2022, a further 10 percent deterioration in the official Peso to USD exchange rate would reduce the USD value of our net monetary assets and negatively impact pre-tax earnings by approximately $20 million. We will continue to assess the implications to our operations and financial reporting.  \nIn April 2022, the company implemented a global business unit organization model (“BU Reorganization”). While the new organization model had no impact on our determination of operating segments, it did result in the company’s digital reporting unit being merged into the seed and crop protection reporting units with the goodwill relating to the former digital reporting unit being reassigned to the seed and crop protection reporting units using a relative fair value allocation approach. The impact of the BU Reorganization did not have a material impact to the company’s historical reportable segments’ financial measures. An interim goodwill impairment assessment immediately prior to the BU Reorganization and for the seed and crop protection reporting units immediately after the BU Reorganization resulted in no goodwill impairment charges.   \nQualitative impairment assessments were performed for the seed and crop protection reporting units. The qualitative assessments included an evaluation of relevant factors including GDP growth rates, long-term commodity prices, equity and credit market activity, discount rates, changes in the industry and market structure, competitive environments, cost factors such as raw material prices, and overall financial performance. Based on the qualitative assessments performed, it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value and therefore a quantitative test was not performed. A quantitative impairment assessment was performed for the former digital reporting unit using a combination of the discounted cash flow model (a form of the income approach) and the market approach. Under the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. The company's significant assumptions in this analysis included future cash flow projections, weighted average cost of capital, the terminal growth rate and the tax rate. The company’s estimate of future cash flows is based on current regulatory and economic climates, recent operating results, and assumed business strategy from a market participant perspective and includes an estimate of a long-term future growth rate based on such strategy. Actual results may differ from those assumed in the company’s forecast. The company derives its discount rate using a capital asset pricing model and analyzes published rates for industries relevant to its reporting unit to estimate the cost of equity financing. The company uses a discount rate that is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the reporting unit and in its internally developed forecast. Under the market approach, the company uses historically completed transactions for comparable companies.  \nNOTE 2 - RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE   \nRecently Adopted Accounting GuidanceIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance, which requires business entities to disclose transactions with a governmental entity for which a grant or contribution accounting model is used in recognizing and measuring such transactions. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and early adoption is permitted. The company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2022 and it did not have a material impact on the company’s disclosures.  \n  \n10\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

Transaction price is typically based on the contracted rates less an estimate of claim denials and historical reimbursement experience by payor, which include current and future expectations regarding reimbursement rates and payor mix.Variable ConsiderationWe include an estimate of variable consideration in the calculation of the transaction price at the time of sale, when control of the Components transfers to the customer. Variable consideration includes, but is not limited to: rebates, chargebacks, consideration payable to customers such as specialty distributor and wholesaler fees, product returns provision, prompt payment discounts, and various other promotional or incentive arrangements. We classify our provisions related to variable consideration as a reduction of accounts receivable when we are not required to make a payment or as a liability when we are required to make a payment.EstimatesWe review the adequacy of our estimates for transaction price adjustments and variable consideration at each reporting date. If the actual amounts of consideration that we were to receive differ from our estimates, we would adjust our estimates and that would affect reported revenue in the period that such variances become known. If any of these judgments were to change, it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue we report in a particular period.RebatesWe are subject to rebates on pricing programs with managed care organizations, such as pharmacy benefit managers, governmental and third-party commercial payors, primarily in the U.S. We estimate provisions for rebates based on contractual arrangements, estimates of products sold subject to rebate, known events or trends and channel inventory data.ChargebacksWe participate in chargeback programs, primarily with government entities in the U.S., under which pricing on products below negotiated list prices is provided to participating entities and equal to the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower negotiated price. We estimate provisions for chargebacks primarily based on historical experience on a product and program basis, current contract prices under the chargeback programs and channel inventory data.Consideration Payable to the CustomerWe pay administrative and service fees to certain of our distributors based on a fixed percentage of the product price. These fees are not in exchange for a distinct good or service and therefore are recognized as a reduction of the transaction price. We accrue for these fees based on actual net sales and contractual fee rates negotiated with the customer.Product ReturnsIn accordance with the terms of their distribution agreements, most distributors do not have rights of return. The distributors typically have a limited time frame to notify us of any missing, damaged, defective or non-conforming products. We generally provide a “30-day money back guarantee” program whereby first-time end-user customers may return Reusable Hardware. We estimate our product returns provision principally based on historical experience by applying a historical return rate to the amounts of revenue estimated to be subject to returns. Additionally, we consider other specific factors such as estimated shelf life of inventory in the distribution channel and changes to customer terms.Prompt Payment DiscountsWe provide customers with prompt payment discounts which may result in adjustments to the price that is invoiced for the product transferred, in the case that payments are made within a defined period. We estimate prompt payment discount accruals based on actual net sales and contractual discount rates.Various Other Promotional or Incentive ArrangementsOther promotional or incentive arrangements are periodically offered to customers, including but not limited to co-payment assistance we provide to patients with commercial insurance, promotional programs related to the launch of products or other targeted promotions. We record a provision for the incentive earned based on the number of estimated claims and our estimate of the cost per claim related to product sales that we have recognized as revenue.12\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

We removed the deferred tax asset reflecting the investment in the partnership and recorded the associated temporary differences in the underlying assets and liabilities. The termination of the partnership is the primary driver of the changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with accrued expenses and other, allowance for loan losses, prepaid expenses and property and equipment. Overall, this adjustment to the deferred tax assets and liabilities resulted in an immaterial impact to the income statement.  \nDuring the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022, we completed our acquisition of Edmunds. As a result of this transaction, we acquired certain net operating losses and other tax attributes which are reflected as deferred tax assets, and certain intangible assets which are reflected as deferred tax liabilities. This includes a deferred tax asset of $10 million related to U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards that have no expiration; a deferred tax asset of $13 million, net of valuation allowances, related to U.S. federal tax credit carryforwards, which expire between 2023 and 2041; a deferred tax asset of $2 million, related to state net operating loss carryforwards, which generally expire between 2022 and 2038; and a deferred tax asset of $12 million related to state tax credit carryforwards that have no expiration.  \nExcept for amounts for which a valuation allowance has been provided, we believe it is more likely than not that the results of future operations and the reversals of existing deferred taxable temporary differences will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets.  The valuation allowance as of February 28, 2022, relates to capital loss and research and development credit carryforwards that are not more likely than not to be utilized prior to their expiration. 70\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

Income TaxesThe Company’s effective income tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 was 23.7 percent and 23.6 percent, respectively. The Company estimates that its annual effective income tax rate for the full year 2022 will be between approximately 23.5 and 24.0 percent. The effective income tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 was 21.9 percent and 22.2 percent, respectively. The change in the effective income tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the effective income tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2021 was primarily due to a change in geographical earnings mix. As of June 30, 2022, the Company had $14.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits of which $0.5 million would affect its effective income tax rate if recognized. The Company recognizes potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. The Company’s U.S. federal income tax returns for 2017-2022 are subject to audit. The Company is subject to state and local income tax audits for tax years 2008-2022. The Company is subject to non-U.S. income tax examinations for years 2015-2022.17\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

Grants to executive officers are generally performance-based. Through a series of shareholder approvals, there have been amended and restated plans and new provisions implemented by the Company. RSUs are subject to quarterly vesting upon retirement or voluntary termination. Employees who attain at least 25 years of service with the Company receive shares under accelerated vesting provisions on the annual vesting date. The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.Summary of Restricted Stock Unit ActivityRSUs granted to employees and to non-employee directors generally vest over five and three years, respectively. Additionally, the terms of the RSUs, including performance-based awards, provide for accelerated vesting for employees and non-employee directors who have attained 25 or more and five or more years of service with the Company, respectively. Recipients are not entitled to vote or receive dividends on unvested and undelivered shares. At the end of 2022, 10,445,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs under the 2019 Incentive Plan.55\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

The grant-date fair value is recognized as expense on a graded-vesting basis over the vesting period. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model for service and performance-based awards, and an adaptation of the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model, which takes into consideration the internal rate of return thresholds, for market-based awards. This model adaptation is essentially equivalent to the use of a path dependent-lattice model. The weighted average of assumptions used in estimating the fair value of stock options granted during each year were as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Fiscal Year Ended June 30, |\n|  | 2022 |  | 2021 |  | 2020 |\n| Expected volatility | 37% |  | 27% |  | 23  | % | - | 24% |\n| Expected life (in years) | 3.7 |  | 6.25 |  | 6.25 |\n| Risk-free interest rate | 0.7% |  | 0.3% |  | 1.7  | % | - | 1.9% |\n| Dividend yield | None |  | None |  | None |\n\nPublic trading of the Common Stock commenced only in July 2014, and, as a result, there was only limited relevant historical volatility experience available; therefore, the expected volatility assumptions for fiscal year 2021 and 2020 were based on the historical volatility of the closing share prices of a comparable peer group. The Company selected peer companies from the pharmaceutical industry with similar characteristics, including market capitalization, number of employees and product focus. In addition, since the Company did not have a pattern of exercise behavior of option holders, for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, the Company used the simplified method to determine the expected life of each option, which is the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term. Effective in fiscal year 2022, the expected volatility and expected holding period were based on the historical volatility and historical holding period of the Common Stock of the Company. The risk-free interest rate for the expected life of the option is based on the comparable U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of stock options in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $32.07 per share, $24.36 per share, and $15.22 per share, respectively.The following table summarizes stock option activity and shares subject to outstanding options for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022: \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  | Time |  |  |  |\n|  | Weighted Average Exercise Price | Number of Shares | Weighted Average Contractual Term | Aggregate Intrinsic Value |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |\n|  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Outstanding as of June 30, 2021 | $ | 49.77  |  | 1,280,174  |  | 4.92 | $ | 74,696,700  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Granted | 113.00  |  | 182,751  |  | —  |  | —  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Exercised  | 42.11  |  | 386,456  |  | —  |  | 29,329,353  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Forfeited | 39.43  |  | 17,559  |  | —  |  | —  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Expired / Canceled | 36.97  |  | 3,399  |  | —  |  | —  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Outstanding as of June 30, 2022 | 63.74  |  | 1,055,511  |  | 6.91 | 47,013,454  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Vest and expected to vest as of June 30, 2022 | 63.74  |  | 1,055,511  |  | 6.91 | 47,013,454  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Vested and exercisable as of June 30, 2022 | $ | 43.80  |  | 437,034  |  | 5.76 | $ | 27,748,162  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\nThe intrinsic value of the options exercised in fiscal 2022 was $29 million.

In December 2020, our Board of Directors granted authority to repurchase up to $15 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2024.During our first quarter of fiscal 2022, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (“ASR”) with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $2.4 billion. Under the terms of the ASR, the financial institution agreed to deliver a portion of shares to us at contract inception and the remaining shares at settlement, which occurred in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. The total number of shares delivered and average purchase price paid per share were determined upon settlement based on the Volume Weighted Average Price (“VWAP”) over the term of the ASR, less an agreed upon discount. During the nine months ended September 2, 2022 and September 3, 2021, we also entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $2.4 billion and $2.95 billion, respectively.

Upon regulatory approval, BeiGene will assume commercialization rights in China for a specified period, and Amgen and BeiGene will share profits equally until certain of these product rights revert to Amgen. Upon return of the product rights, Amgen will pay royalties to BeiGene on sales in China for a specified period. For product sales outside China, Amgen will also pay royalties to BeiGene.During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, net costs recovered from BeiGene for oncology product candidates were $220 million and $225 million, respectively, and were recorded as an offset to R&D expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. During the year ended December 31, 2021, product sales from Amgen to BeiGene under the collaboration were $72 million and were recorded in Product sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income. During the year ended December 31, 2021, profit and loss share expenses related to the initial product-specific commercialization period were $64 million and were recorded primarily in SG&A expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Product sales from Amgen to BeiGene and profit and loss share expenses were not material during the year ended December 31, 2020. Amounts owed from BeiGene for product sales were $21 million and $22 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which are included in Trade receivables, net, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

On January 31, 2022, concurrent with the settlement of the previously disclosed litigation between Amgen and Novartis we modified the terms of the collaboration. See Note 19, Contingencies and commitments.Arrangement through December 31, 2021In the United States, Amgen and Novartis jointly developed and collaborated on the commercialization of Aimovig. Amgen, as the principal, recognized product sales of Aimovig in the United States, shared U.S. commercialization costs with Novartis and paid Novartis a significant royalty on net sales in the United States. Novartis holds global co-development rights and exclusive commercial rights outside the United States and Japan for Aimovig (the ex-U.S. Novartis Rights). Novartis paid Amgen double-digit royalties on net sales of the product in the ex-U.S. Novartis Rights territories and funded a portion of global R&D expenses. In addition, Novartis was required to make a payment to Amgen of up to $100 million if certain commercial and expenditure thresholds were achieved with respect to Aimovig in the United States. Arrangement after January 1, 2022Pursuant to the amendment effective January 1, 2022, Novartis retains the ex-U.S. Novartis Rights and will continue to pay double-digit royalties on net sales in the ex-U.S. Novartis Rights territories. In the United States, Novartis will no longer collaborate with Amgen, share Aimovig commercialization costs or pay milestones and Amgen will no longer pay royalties to Novartis on sales of Aimovig. Amgen and Novartis will continue to share development expenses worldwide. In the United States, Novartis will no longer collaborate with Amgen or share Aimovig commercialization costs and Amgen will no longer pay royalties to Novartis on sales of Aimovig.

The trusts were capitalized with equity from six owner participants with no relationship to AEP or any of its subsidiaries and debt from a syndicate of banks and securities in a private placement to certain institutional investors.  \nThe trusts own undivided interests in Rockport Plant, Unit 2 and leases equal portions to AEGCo and I&M.  In April 2021, AEGCo and I&M executed an agreement to purchase 100% of the interests in the Rockport Plant, Unit 2 effective at the end of the lease term in December 2022. In December 2021, AEGCo and I&M satisfied the necessary regulatory approvals to complete the acquisition. Upon receipt of the regulatory approval, the addition of the lessee forward purchase obligation resulted in the modified lease changing classification from operating to finance for AEGCo and I&M. The future minimum lease payments as of June 30, 2022, inclusive of the purchase obligation, were as follows:  \n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Future Minimum Lease Payments |  | AEP (a) |  | I&M |\n|  |  | (in millions) |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| 2022 |  | $ | 174.9  |  |  | $ | 87.4  |  |\n| Total Future Minimum Lease Payments |  | $ | 174.9  |  |  | $ | 87.4  |  |\n\n  \n(a)AEP’s future minimum lease payments include equal shares from AEGCo and I&M.  \nThe lease modification also created variable interests in the trusts that own the undivided interests in Rockport Plant, Unit 2 for AEGCo and I&M. Neither AEGCo nor I&M are the primary beneficiaries of the trusts because AEGCo nor I&M has the power to direct the most significant activities of the trusts. AEP and I&M’s maximum exposure to loss associated with the trust is equal to the total future minimum lease payments, inclusive of the purchase obligation, as shown in the table above.   \nAEPRO Boat and Barge Leases (Applies to AEP)  \nIn 2015, AEP sold its commercial barge transportation subsidiary, AEPRO, to a nonaffiliated party. Certain boat and barge leases acquired by the nonaffiliated party are subject to an AEP guarantee in favor of the respective lessors, ensuring future payments under such leases with maturities up to 2027. As of June 30, 2022, the maximum potential amount of future payments required under the guaranteed leases was $38 million. Under the terms of certain of the arrangements, upon the lessors exercising their rights after an event of default by the nonaffiliated party, AEP is entitled to enter into new lease arrangements as a lessee that would have substantially the same terms as the existing leases. Alternatively, for the arrangements with one of the lessors, upon an event of default by the nonaffiliated party and the lessor exercising its rights, payment to the lessor would allow AEP to step into the lessor’s rights as well as obtaining title to the assets. Under either situation, AEP would have the ability to utilize the assets in the normal course of barging operations. AEP would also have the right to sell the acquired assets for which it obtained title. As of June 30, 2022, AEP’s boat and barge lease guarantee liability was $2 million, of which $1 million was recorded in Other Current Liabilities and $1 million was recorded in Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities on AEP’s balance sheets.  \nIn February 2020, the nonaffiliated party filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The party entered into a restructuring support agreement and has announced it expected to continue their operations as normal. In March 2020, the bankruptcy court approved the party’s recapitalization plan. In April 2020, the nonaffiliated party emerged from bankruptcy. Management has determined that it is reasonably possible that enforcement of AEP’s liability for future payments under these leases will be exercised within the next twelve months. In such an event, if AEP is unable to sell or incorporate any of the acquired assets into its fleet operations, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.  \n170\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

The options will become exercisable over five years, subject to continued service by the executive, with 20% vesting on the first anniversary of the grant date and the balance vesting monthly over the subsequent four years. Separate and apart from the time-based vesting schedule, the options are also subject to a market condition requiring the trading price of Copart, Inc. common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market to be greater than or equal to 125% of the exercise price of the options, determined both (i) at the time of any exercise, and (ii) based on the closing price on each of the twenty consecutive trading days preceding the date of any exercise. The exercise price of the options is equivalent to the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. The fair value of the awards is determined at the grant date using either the Lattice or Monte Carlo model, risk-free interest rates ranging from 0.71% to 2.38%, estimated volatility ranging from 25.2% to 25.7%, and no expected dividends. The total estimated compensation expense to be recognized by the Company over the five-year service period for these options is $45.9 million and will be recognized using the accelerated attribution method over each vesting tranche of the award. The Company recognized $9.8 million, $13.1 million and $1.6 million in compensation expense related to these awards for the year ended July 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  \nThe following is a summary of activity for the Company’s stock option awards subject to market conditions for the year ended July 31, 2022:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| (In thousands, except per share and term data) |  | Shares |  | Weighted Average Exercise Price |  | Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Term (In years) |  | Aggregate Intrinsic Value |\n| Outstanding as of July 31, 2021 |  | 1,130  |  |  | $ | 87.49  |  |  | 8.96 |  | $ | 67,250  |  |\n| Grants of options |  | 325  |  |  | 125.68  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Exercises |  | —  |  |  | —  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Forfeitures or expirations |  | (50) |  |  | 106.31  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Outstanding as of July 31, 2022 |  | 1,405  |  |  | $ | 95.65  |  |  | 8.33 |  | $ | 45,590  |  |\n| Exercisable as of July 31, 2022 |  | 438  |  |  | $ | 86.08  |  |  | 7.91 |  | $ | 18,406  |  |\n| Vested and expected to vest as of July 31, 2022 |  | 1,396  |  |  | $ | 95.59  |  |  | 8.33 |  | $ | 45,402  |  |\n\n  \nThe aggregate intrinsic value in the tables above represents the total pretax intrinsic value (i.e., the difference between the Company’s closing stock price on the last trading day of the year ended July 31, 2022 and the exercise price, times the number of shares) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on July 31, 2022. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised was $30.5 million, $143.3 million and $476.3 million in the years ended July 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and represents the difference between the exercise price of the option and the estimated fair value of the Company’s common stock on the dates exercised.

The Receivables Purchase Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties, as well as affirmative and negative covenants. Pursuant to the Receivables Purchase Agreement, the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred receivables, and therefore accounts for these transfers as sales of receivables. This accounts receivable securitization arrangement totaled $325 at both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 of which $250 was drawn as of both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

The Company earns revenue for placing and maintaining unaffiliated fund partners and insurance companies’ products on the Company’s sales platform (subject to the Company’s due diligence standards). The revenue is primarily earned based on a fixed fee or a fixed rate applied, as a percentage, to the market value of assets invested. These performance obligations are considered a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and are satisfied each day over the contract term. These fees are invoiced and collected on monthly basis.Other ProductsThe Company earns revenue for selling unaffiliated alternative products. The performance obligation is satisfied at the time of each individual sale. A portion of the revenue is based on a fixed rate applied, as a percentage, to amounts invested at the time of sale. The remaining revenue is recognized over the time the client owns the investment and is earned generally based on a fixed rate applied, as a percentage, to the market value of the investment. The ongoing revenue is not recognized at the time of sale because it is variably constrained due to factors outside the Company’s control including market volatility and client behavior (such as how long clients hold their investment). The revenue will not be recognized until it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur. The Company earns revenue from brokerage clients for the execution of requested trades. The performance obligation is satisfied at the time of trade execution and amounts are received on the settlement date. The revenue varies for each trade based on various factors that include the type of investment, dollar amount of the trade and how the trade is executed (online or broker assisted).The Company earns revenue for placing clients’ deposits in its brokerage sweep program with third-party banks. The amount received from the third-party banks is impacted by short-term interest rates. The performance obligation with the financial institutions that participate in the sweep program is considered a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and are satisfied each day over the contract term. The revenue is earned daily and settled monthly based on a rate applied, as a percentage, to the deposits placed.Other RevenuesThe Company earns revenue from fees charged to franchise advisors for providing various services the advisors need to manage and grow their practices. The primary services include: licensing of intellectual property and software, compliance supervision, insurance coverage, technology services and support, consulting and other services. The services are either provided by the Company or third- party providers. The Company controls the services provided by third parties as it has the right to direct the third parties to perform the services, is primarily responsible for performing the services and sets the prices the advisors are charged. The Company recognizes revenue for the gross amount of the fees received from the advisors. The fees are primarily collected monthly as a reduction of commission payments.Intellectual property and software licenses, along with compliance supervision, insurance coverage, and technology services and support are primarily earned based on a monthly fixed fee. These services are considered a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and are satisfied each day over the contract term. The consulting and other services performance obligations are satisfied as the services are delivered and revenue is earned based upon the level of service requested.Contract Costs AssetDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company recognized an asset of $39 million related to the transition of investment advisory services under an arrangement with BMO Financial Group for clients that elected to transfer U.S. retail and institutional assets to the Company. ReceivablesReceivables for revenue from contracts with customers are recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied and the Company has an unconditional right to the revenue. Receivables related to revenues from contracts with customers were $668 million and $403 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 5.  Variable Interest Entities The Company provides asset management services to investment entities which are considered to be VIEs, such as CLOs, hedge funds and other private funds, property funds, and certain non-U.S. series funds (such as OEICs and SICAVs) (collectively, “investment entities”), which are sponsored by the Company. In addition, the Company invests in structured investments other than CLOs and certain affordable housing partnerships which are considered VIEs. The Company consolidates certain investment entities (collectively, “consolidated investment entities”) if the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The Company has no obligation to provide financial or other support to the non-consolidated VIEs beyond its initial investment and existing future funding commitments, and the Company has not provided any other support to these entities. The Company has unfunded commitments related to consolidated CLOs of $27 million and $13 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Note 26 for information on future funding commitments of other VIEs.

As a U.S. corporation, Citigroup and its U.S. subsidiaries are currently subject to U.S. taxation on all non-U.S. pretax earnings of non-U.S. branches. Beginning in 2018, there is a separate foreign tax credit (FTC) basket for branches. Also, dividends from a non-U.S. subsidiary or affiliate are effectively exempt from U.S. taxation. The Company provides income taxes on the book over tax basis differences of non-U.S. subsidiaries except to the extent that such differences are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. At December 31, 2021, $6.5 billion of basis differences of non-U.S. entities was indefinitely invested. At the existing tax rates (including withholding taxes), additional taxes (net of U.S. FTCs and valuation allowances) of $1.8 billion would have to be provided if such assertions were reversed.Income taxes are not provided for the Company’s “savings bank base year bad debt reserves” that arose before 1988, because under current U.S. tax rules, such taxes will become payable only to the extent that such amounts are distributed in excess of limits prescribed by federal law. At December 31, 2021, the amount of the base year reserves totaled approximately $358 million (subject to a tax of $75 million).184\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

The Company had $26 net cash repayments ($18 in draws and $44 in repayments) for the three months ended March 31, 2021 in connection with this arrangement.The second accounts receivables securitization arrangement is one in which the Company, through a wholly-owned special purpose entity (“SPE”), has a receivables purchase agreement (the “Receivables Purchase Agreement”) such that the SPE may sell certain receivables to financial institutions until the earlier of August 30, 2024 or a termination event. The Receivables Purchase Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties, as well as affirmative and negative covenants. Pursuant to the Receivables Purchase Agreement, the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred receivables, and therefore accounts for these transfers as sales of receivables. This accounts receivable securitization arrangement totaled $325 at both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 of which $250 was drawn as of both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. As collateral against the sold receivables, the SPE maintains a certain level of unsold receivables, which were $100 and $79 at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.The Company sold $464 and $84 of its receivables without recourse and received cash funding under this program during the three months ended March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021, respectively, resulting in derecognition of the receivables from the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Costs associated with the sales of receivables are reflected in the Company’s Statement of Consolidated Operations for the periods in which the sales occur. Cash receipts from sold receivables under the Receivables Purchase Agreement are presented within operating activities in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows.Other Customer Receivable SalesIn the first quarter of 2022, the Company sold $106 of certain customers’ receivables in exchange for cash ($110 was outstanding from customers at March 31, 2022), the proceeds from which are presented in changes in receivables within operating activities in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows.

Nonradiation events are limited to $328 million.The Price-Anderson Act is a federal law that limits the liability for claims from an incident involving any licensed United States commercial nuclear energy center. The limit is based on the number of licensed reactors. The limit of liability and the maximum potential annual payments are adjusted at least every five years for inflation to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index.

Business Combinations   \nThe Company completed several individually immaterial acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company’s assessment of fair value, including the valuation of certain acquired intangibles, and the purchase price allocation related to these acquisitions is preliminary and subject to change upon completion. Further adjustments may be necessary as additional information related to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is assessed during the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date). The Company recorded goodwill from these acquisitions, primarily attributable to assembled workforce and expected synergies. The consolidated financial statements include the results of the acquisitions subsequent to their respective closing dates.

The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect as of the acquisition date. Expected volatility was determined using a weighted-average of the implied volatility and the mean reversion volatility of the Company’s stock at the time of conversion.Share-Based Compensation ActivityThe weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted during 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $33.35, $35.02 and $28.52 per share, respectively. The fair values of stock options granted were estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option-pricing model with the following assumptions:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | 2021 |  | 2020 |  | 2019 |\n| Expected life (in years) | 6.5 |  | 6.4 |  | 6.4 |\n| Average risk-free interest rate | 0.6  | % |  | 1.8  | % |  | 2.7  | % |\n| Expected volatility | 29.3  | % |  | 28.3  | % |  | 28.5  | % |\n| Expected dividend yield | 0  | % |  | 0  | % |  | 0  | % |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\nThe Company determined the expected life of stock options using historical data. The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect as of the grant date. Expected volatility was determined using weighted-average implied market volatility combined with historical volatility. The Company believes that a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility better reflects future market conditions and better indicates expected volatility than purely historical volatility.A summary of stock option activity is as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Shares(In thousands) |  | Weighted-AverageExercisePrice |  | Weighted-AverageRemainingContractualTerm (Years) |  | AggregateIntrinsicValue(In millions) |\n| Stock options outstanding - December 31, 2020 | 14,689  |  |  | $ | 50.82  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Granted | 168  |  |  | 111.86  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Forfeited | (214) |  |  | 108.74  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Exercised | (4,414) |  |  | 37.51  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Stock options outstanding - December 31, 2021 | 10,229  |  |  | $ | 56.36  |  |  | 4.26 |  | $ | 498  |  |\n| Stock options exercisable - December 31, 2021 | 8,822  |  |  | $ | 48.38  |  |  | 3.65 |  | $ | 492  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\nA summary of restricted stock unit, restricted stock award and performance share unit activity is as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  | Restricted Stock Units and Awards |  | Performance Share Units |\n|  |  | Shares(In thousands) |  | Weighted-AverageGrant DateFair Value |  | Shares(In thousands) |  | Weighted-AverageGrant DateFair Value |\n| Units and awards - December 31, 2020 |  | 4,797  |  |  | $ | 98.29  |  |  | 1,821  |  |  | $ | 95.20  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Granted |  | 3,152  |  |  | 104.38  |  |  | 255  |  |  | 108.68  |  |\n| Forfeited |  | (420) |  |  | 103.99  |  |  | (158) |  |  | 103.12  |  |\n| Vested |  | (2,455) |  |  | 99.09  |  |  | (526) |  |  | 92.72  |  |\n| Units and awards - December 31, 2021 |  | 5,074  |  |  | $ | 101.09  |  |  | 1,392  |  |  | $ | 96.32  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n88\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

As of September 30, 2022, $612.8 million remained available under the share repurchase program. The Company may repurchase its common stock from time-to-time in amounts, at prices and in the manner that the Company deems appropriate, subject to the availability of stock, prevailing market conditions, the trading price of the stock, the Company’s financial performance and other conditions. Repurchases may be made through open market purchases (which may include repurchase plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), accelerated share repurchases, private transactions or other transactions and will be funded by cash on hand and borrowings.

The plans allow for the granting of equity-based compensation awards, including nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, stock- and cash-settled restricted stock units, stock grants or a combination of awards.  To date, we have not awarded any incentive stock options.  As of February 28, 2022, a total of 60,850,000 shares of our common stock had been authorized to be issued under the long-term incentive plans.  The number of unissued common shares reserved for future grants under the long-term incentive plans was 6,700,484 as of that date.  The majority of associates who receive share-based compensation awards primarily receive cash-settled restricted stock units.  Senior management and other key associates receive awards of nonqualified stock options, stock-settled restricted stock units and/or restricted stock awards.  Nonemployee directors receive awards of nonqualified stock options, stock grants, stock-settled restricted stock units and/or restricted stock awards.  Excluding stock grants and stock-settled deferred stock units, all share-based compensation awards, including any associated dividend rights, are subject to forfeiture.  \nNonqualified Stock Options.  Nonqualified stock options are awards that allow the recipient to purchase shares of our common stock at a fixed price.  Stock options are granted at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date.  The stock options generally vest annually in equal amounts over four years.  These options expire seven years after the date of the grant.  \nCash-Settled Restricted Stock Units.  Also referred to as restricted stock units, or RSUs, these are awards that entitle the holder to a cash payment equal to the fair market value of a share of our common stock for each unit granted.  For grants prior to fiscal 2021, conversion generally occurs at the end of a three-year vesting period.  For RSUs granted during or after fiscal 2021, conversion generally occurs annually in equal amounts over three years. However, the cash payment per RSU will not be greater than 200% or less than 75% of the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the grant date.  The initial grant date fair values are based on the volume-weighted average prices or closing prices of our common stock on the grant dates. RSUs are liability-classified awards and do not have voting rights. Stock-Settled Market Stock Units.  Also referred to as market stock units, or MSUs, these are restricted stock unit awards with market conditions granted to eligible key associates that are converted into between zero and two shares of common stock for each unit granted.  Conversion generally occurs at the end of a three-year vesting period.  The conversion ratio is calculated by dividing the average closing price of our stock during the final 40 trading days of the three-year vesting period by our stock price on the grant date, with the resulting quotient capped at two.  This quotient is then multiplied by the number of MSUs granted to yield the number of shares awarded.  The grant date fair values are determined using a Monte-Carlo simulation and are based on the expected market price of our common stock on the vesting date and the expected number of converted common shares.

HP has elected the practical expedients and accordingly does not disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations if: •the contract has an original expected duration of one year or less; or•the revenue from the performance obligation is recognized over time on an as-invoiced basis when the amount corresponds directly with the value to the customer; or•the portion of the transaction price that is variable in nature is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation.The remaining performance obligations are subject to change and may be affected by various factors, such as termination of contracts, contract modifications and adjustment for currency.Costs of Obtaining Contracts and Fulfillment CostAs of October 31, 2021, deferred contract fulfillment and acquisition costs balances were $65 million and $36 million, respectively, included in Other Current Assets and Other Non-Current Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

We typically advance development funds to the independent artists and third-party developers during development of our games, usually in installment payments made upon the completion of specified development milestones. Contractually, these payments are generally considered advances against subsequent royalties on the sales of the products. These terms are set forth in written agreements entered into with the independent artists and third-party developers.In addition, we have certain celebrity, league and content license contracts that contain minimum guarantee payments and marketing commitments to promote the games we publish that may not be dependent on any deliverables. These developer and content license commitments represent the sum of (1) the cash payments due under non-royalty-bearing licenses and services agreements and (2) the minimum guaranteed payments and advances against royalties due under royalty-bearing licenses and services agreements, the majority of which are conditional upon performance by the counterparty.

As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, Exelon Corporate had $319 million and $324 million, respectively, recorded to intercompany notes receivable from Generation. In connection with the separation, on January 31, 2022, Exelon Corporate received cash from Generation of $258 million to settle the intercompany loan.Debt CovenantsAs of December 31, 2021, the Registrants are in compliance with debt covenants.Nonrecourse Debt Exelon, through Generation, has issued nonrecourse debt financing, in which approximately $2 billion of generating assets have been pledged as collateral as of December 31, 2021. Borrowings under these agreements are secured by the assets and equity of each respective project. The lenders do not have recourse against Exelon in the event of a default. If a specific project financing entity does not maintain compliance with its specific nonrecourse debt financing covenants, there could be a requirement to accelerate repayment of the associated debt or other borrowings earlier than the stated maturity dates. In these instances, if such repayment was not satisfied, the lenders or security holders would generally have rights to foreclose against the project-specific assets and related collateral. The potential requirement to satisfy its associated debt or other borrowings earlier than otherwise anticipated could lead to impairments due to a higher likelihood of disposing of the respective project-specific assets significantly before the end of their useful lives.Antelope Valley Solar Ranch One. In December 2011, the DOE Loan Programs Office issued a guarantee for up to $646 million for a nonrecourse loan from the Federal Financing Bank to support the financing of the construction of the Antelope Valley facility. The project became fully operational in 2014. The loan will mature on January 5, 2037. Interest rates on the loan were fixed upon each advance at a spread of 37.5 basis points above U.S. Treasuries of comparable maturity. The advances were completed as of December 31, 2015 and the outstanding loan balance will bear interest at an average blended interest rate of 2.82%. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, approximately $435 million and $460 million were outstanding, respectively. In addition, letters of credit were issued to support Generation's equity investment in the project with $37 million outstanding as of December 31, 2021. In December 2017, Exelon’s interests in Antelope Valley were contributed to and are pledged as collateral for the CR financing structures referenced below.Continental Wind, LLC.  In September 2013, Continental Wind, an indirect subsidiary of Exelon, completed the issuance and sale of $613 million senior secured notes. Continental Wind owns and operates a portfolio of wind farms in Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, Oregon, New Mexico, and Texas with a total net capacity of 667 MW. The net proceeds were distributed to Generation for its general business purposes. The notes are scheduled to mature on February 28, 2033. The notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.00% with interest payable semi-annually. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, approximately $380 million and $415 million were outstanding, respectively.In addition, Continental Wind has a $122 million letter of credit facility and $4 million working capital revolver facility.

SUMMARIZED FINANCIAL INFORMATION. We account for our remaining interest in Baker Hughes (comprising 166.6 million shares with approximately 16% ownership interest as of December 31, 2021) at fair value. As of November 3, 2021, our investment in BKR ownership reduced below 20%, and as a result, we no longer have significant influence in BKR. The fair value of our interest in Baker Hughes at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $4,010 million and $7,319 million, respectively. We recognized a realized and unrealized pre-tax gain of $938 million ($696 million after-tax) based on a share price of $24.06, a realized and unrealized pre-tax loss of $2,037 million ($1,562 million after-tax) based on a share price of $20.85 and a pre-tax unrealized gain of $793 million ($626 million after-tax) based on a share price of $25.63 for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The 2021 gain and 2020 loss included a $129 million pre-tax derivative gain and a $54 million pre-tax derivative loss, respectively, associated with the forward sale of Baker Hughes shares pursuant to our previously announced program to monetize our Baker Hughes position. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we completed forward sales of 183 million and 28 million shares and received proceeds of $4,145 million and $417 million, respectively. In February 2022, we completed a forward sale of 50 million shares and received proceeds of $1,302 million. See Notes 2 and 3 for further information.

KDG, which is headquartered in Bloomfield, Connecticut, is a power transmission, automation and fluid power industrial distributor and solutions provider with operations throughout the United States, providing electro-mechanical products, bearings, power transmission, motion control and electrical and fluid power components to MRO and OEM customers. KDG has approximately 1,700 employees with approximately 220 locations across the United States and Puerto Rico. As of January 3, 2022, KDG had estimated annual revenues of approximately $1 billion.The net cash consideration transferred of approximately $1.3 billion is net of the estimated cash acquired of approximately $30 million. The KDG acquisition was financed using a combination of borrowings under the existing unsecured revolving credit facility, proceeds of $200 million from the selling of additional receivables under our amended A/R Sales Agreement and $109 million of cash. The following table summarizes the preliminary, estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as adjustments made to the acquisition accounting during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 (referred to as the \"measurement period adjustments\"). The measurement period adjustments primarily resulted from revisions to the valuation of certain tangible and intangible assets. The fair value of the acquired identifiable intangible assets is provisional pending completion of the final valuations for these assets. We are in the process of analyzing the estimated values of all assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date, including, among other things, obtaining valuations of certain tangible and intangible assets, as well as the fair value of certain contracts and the determination of certain tax balances.

Cadence has elected to exclude the potential future royalty receipts from the remaining performance obligations. Contracted but unsatisfied performance obligations were approximately $4.4 billion as of January 1, 2022, which included $119.5 million of non-cancellable IPAA commitments from customers where actual product selection and quantities of specific products or services are to be determined by customers at a later date. As of January 1, 2022, Cadence expected to recognize approximately 55% of the contracted but unsatisfied performance obligations, excluding non-cancellable IPAA commitments, as revenue over the next 12 months and the remainder thereafter.Cadence recognized revenue of $47.1 million, $51.2 million and $40.4 million during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods. These amounts represent royalties earned during the period and exclude contracts with nonrefundable prepaid royalties. Nonrefundable prepaid royalties are recognized upon delivery of the IP because Cadence’s right to the consideration is not contingent upon customers’ future shipments.NOTE 6. ACQUISITIONS 2021 AcquisitionsOn February 23, 2021, Cadence acquired all of the outstanding equity of Belgium-based Numerical Mechanics Applications International SA (“NUMECA”). The addition of NUMECA’s technologies and talent supports Cadence’s Intelligent System Design™ strategy, servicing the computational fluid dynamics (“CFD”) market segment as part of System Design and Analysis. The aggregate cash consideration for Cadence’s acquisition of NUMECA, net of cash acquired of $9.6 million, was $188.6 million. Cadence expects to recognize expense for consideration paid to certain former NUMECA shareholders that is subject to service and other conditions, through the first quarter of fiscal 2023.The total purchase consideration was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with Cadence’s acquisition of NUMECA based on their respective estimated fair values on the acquisition date as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|   | Acquisition Date Fair Value |\n|   | (In thousands) |\n| Current assets | $ | 16,423  |  |\n| Goodwill | 133,077  |  |\n| Acquired intangibles | 72,200  |  |\n| Other long-term assets | 6,928  |  |\n| Total assets acquired | 228,628  |  |\n| Current liabilities | 9,951  |  |\n| Long-term liabilities | 20,475  |  |\n| Total liabilities assumed | 30,426  |  |\n| Total purchase consideration | $ | 198,202  |  |\n\nThe recorded goodwill is attributed to intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, including the acquired assembled workforce and expected synergies from combining operations of NUMECA with Cadence. Cadence expects all of the goodwill related to the acquisition of NUMECA to be deductible for tax purposes.On April 14, 2021, Cadence acquired all of the outstanding equity of Pointwise, Inc. (“Pointwise”), a leader in mesh generation for CFD for cash consideration of approximately $31.4 million, net of cash acquired. The addition of Pointwise’s technologies and experienced team supports Cadence’s Intelligent System Design strategy and further broadens its System Design and Analysis portfolio, complementing its acquisition of NUMECA. The total purchase consideration was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values on the acquisition dates. Cadence recorded $16.7 million of definite-lived intangible assets and $16.7 million of goodwill with its acquisition of Pointwise. All of the goodwill related to Cadence’s acquisition of Pointwise is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.Cadence completed two additional acquisitions during fiscal 2021.

We incurred new debt issuance costs of $4 million and $9 million during 2021 and 2020, respectively, relating to the Credit Facility and these costs are represented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as other non-current assets and will be amortized over the remaining life of the Credit Facility. No amounts were outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2021.As of December 31, 2021, of the $3.8 billion that is currently available for borrowing under the Credit Facility, $1.0 billion is required to back-stop the amount outstanding under our U.S. dollar commercial paper program, or the Commercial Paper Program, and $171 million is required to support certain broker-dealer and other subsidiary commitments. The amount required to back-stop the amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program will fluctuate as we increase or decrease our commercial paper borrowings. The remaining $2.6 billion is available for working capital and general corporate purposes including, but not limited to, acting as a back-stop to future increases in the amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program.We also pay an annual commitment fee for unutilized amounts payable in arrears at a rate that ranges from 0.08% to 0.20% determined based on our current long-term debt rating. As of December 31, 2021, the applicable rate for commitments to October 2026 was 0.13%. Amounts borrowed under the facility may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty.The Credit Facility also contains customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default, including a leverage ratio, limitations on liens on our assets, indebtedness of non-obligor subsidiaries, the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and other matters.•Term Loan: On August 21, 2020, we entered into a $750 million 18-month senior unsecured delayed draw term loan facility with a maturity date of February 21, 2022. We borrowed in full under the facility on September 3, 2020, and the proceeds were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Ellie Mae acquisition. We had the option to prepay the facility in whole or in part at any time, and paid off the full balance of the loan on December 16, 2020. Interest on borrowings under this term loan facility were based on the principal amount outstanding at the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus an applicable margin, which was equal to 1.125%. We incurred new debt issuance costs of $3 million during 2020 relating to this term loan and these costs were fully amortized when the term loan was repaid on December 16, 2020.    •Other: Our India subsidiaries maintain $20 million of credit lines for their general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2021, they had borrowed $10 million, which is reflected as \"other short-term debt\" in the table above. Commercial Paper ProgramOur Commercial Paper Program is currently backed by the borrowing capacity available under the Credit Facility, as described above. The effective interest rate of commercial paper issuances does not materially differ from short-term interest rates, which fluctuate due to market conditions and as a result may impact our interest expense.We had net repayments of $1.4 billion under the Commercial Paper Program during 2021. We used $1.2 billion of proceeds received from the sale of our Coinbase investment to pay down the commercial paper balance. We had net issuances of $1.1 billion under the Commercial Paper Program during 2020, the proceeds of which were primarily used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Ellie Mae acquisition. We had net issuances of $360 million under the Commercial Paper Program during 2019 the proceeds of which were used to fund the acquisition of Simplifile and for general corporate purposes. We repaid a portion of the amounts outstanding under the program during 2021, 2020 and 2019 with cash flows from operations.Commercial paper notes of $1.0 billion with original maturities ranging from three to 73 days were outstanding as of December 31, 2021, with a weighted average interest rate of 0.33% per annum, and a weighted average remaining maturity of 26 days. Commercial paper notes of $2.4 billion with original maturities ranging from four to 266 days were outstanding as of December 31, 2020 with a weighted average interest rate of 0.40% per annum, and a weighted average remaining maturity of 82 days.Fixed Rate Senior Notes•Senior Notes Issued in August 2020: On August 20, 2020, we issued $6.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of new senior notes, comprised of $1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due in 2023, or the Floating Rate Notes, $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 0.70% senior notes due in 2023, $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of 1.85% senior notes due in 2032, $1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of 2.65% senior notes due in 2040, and $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of 3.00% senior notes 116\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

Right-of-use assets were further adjusted for any off-market terms of the lease. The remaining lease term is based on the remaining term at the Closing Date plus any renewal or extension options that the Company is reasonably certain will be exercised. Additionally, the Company has elected short-term lease treatment for those acquired lease contracts which, at the Closing Date, have a remaining lease term of 12 months or less. For the leases acquired through the Transactions, the Company will retain the previous lease classification.

Increases (decreases) in volatility would increase (decrease) the value for the holder of the option (writer of the option). Generally, a change in the estimate of forward commodity prices is unrelated to a change in the estimate of volatility of prices. An increase to the reserves listed above would decrease the fair value of the positions. An increase to the heat rate or renewable factors would increase the fair value accordingly. Generally, interrelationships exist between market prices of natural gas and power. As such, an increase in natural gas pricing would potentially have a similar impact on forward power markets.19.

Nuclear Insurance We are subject to liability, property damage and other risks associated with major incidents at any of our nuclear stations. We have mitigated our financial exposure to these risks through insurance and other industry risk-sharing provisions.The Price-Anderson Act was enacted to ensure the availability of funds for public liability claims arising from an incident at any of the U.S. licensed nuclear facilities and to limit the liability of nuclear reactor owners for such claims from any single incident. As of December 31, 2021, the current liability limit per incident is $13.5 billion and is subject to change to account for the effects of inflation and changes in the number of licensed reactors at least once every five years with the last adjustment effective November 1, 2018. In accordance with the Price-Anderson Act, we maintain financial protection at levels equal to the amount of liability insurance available from private sources through the purchase of private nuclear energy liability insurance for public liability claims that could arise in the event of an incident. Effective January 1, 2017, the required amount of nuclear energy liability insurance purchased is $450 million for each operating site. Claims exceeding that amount are covered through mandatory participation in a financial protection pool, as required by the Price Anderson-Act, which provides the additional $13.1 billion per incident in funds available for public liability claims. Participation in this secondary financial protection pool requires the operator of each reactor to fund its proportionate share of costs for any single incident that exceeds the primary layer of financial protection. Our share of this secondary layer would be approximately $2.8 billion, however any amounts payable under this secondary layer would be capped at $413 million per year.In addition, the U.S. Congress could impose revenue-raising measures on the nuclear industry to pay public liability claims exceeding the $13.5 billion limit for a single incident.As part of the execution of the NOSA on April 1, 2014, we executed an Indemnity Agreement pursuant to which we agreed to indemnify EDF and its affiliates against third-party claims that may arise from any future nuclear incident (as defined in the Price-Anderson Act) in connection with the CENG nuclear plants or their operations. See Note 21 — Variable Interest Entities for additional information on our operations relating to CENG.We are required each year to report to the NRC the current levels and sources of property insurance that demonstrates we possess sufficient financial resources to stabilize and decontaminate a reactor and reactor station site in the event of an accident. The property insurance maintained for each facility is currently provided 145  \n  \n  \n\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}
{"question": "Outstanding letters of credit", "answer": "7.2", "task": "SEC-NUM", "context": "\n[Table of Contents](#i1c7c95a3a35c4e5dafc8b646de4a8ff7_7)  \nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at either an alternate base rate or adjusted LIBOR plus, in each case, an applicable margin. Such applicable margin is based on the lower of the Company’s senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating or the Company’s applicable leverage ratio and can range from 0.00% to 1.275%. Interest is payable (a) in the case of base rate loans, quarterly, and (b) in the case of LIBOR loans, on the last day of the applicable interest period selected, or every three months from the effective date of such interest period for interest periods exceeding three months.   \nThe Credit Agreement requires payment to the lenders of a facility fee based upon the amount of the lenders’ commitments under the credit facility from time to time, determined based on the lower of the Company’s senior, unsecured long-term debt rating or the Company’s applicable leverage ratio. Voluntary prepayments of any loans and voluntary reductions of the unutilized portion of the commitments under the Credit Agreement are permissible without penalty, subject to break funding payments and minimum notice and minimum reduction amount requirements.  \nThe Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for senior unsecured credit agreements. There are two key financial covenants that the Company is required to maintain in connection with the Credit Agreement and the Senior Notes, excluding the 3.00% Senior Notes which have no financial covenants, a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.0 to 1 and a maximum leverage ratio of 3.50 to 1, which is the ratio of the Company’s consolidated total debt to its consolidated earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), both of which are tested quarterly and in the case of the leverage ratio under the Revolving Facility, there is an option to increase the ratio to 4.00 for 12 months in connection with certain acquisitions. At December 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with each financial covenant under Credit Agreement and the Senior Notes, excluding the 3.00% Senior Notes which have no financial covenants. While there are no financial covenants relating to the 3.00% Senior Notes, they are subject to cross-default provisions. The negative covenants include restrictions on the Company’s ability to grant liens, enter into transactions resulting in fundamental changes (such as mergers or sales of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company), make certain subsidiary dividends or distributions, engage in materially different lines of businesses and allow subsidiaries to incur certain additional debt.  \nThe Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default (subject to grace periods, as appropriate).  \nAt December 31, 2021, there was no balance outstanding under the Revolving Facility and $7.2 million of outstanding letters of credit, resulting in a net available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility at December 31, 2021 of approximately $792.8 million. In addition, there were no borrowings under the Revolving Facility during the year ended December 31, 2021.  \nIssuance of 3.20% Senior Notes and 3.37% Senior Notes in 2016  \nOn June 13, 2016, the Company completed a private placement of a $100 million aggregate principal amount of 3.20% Senior Notes due June 13, 2023 (the “3.20% Senior Notes”) and a $100 million aggregate principal amount of 3.37% Senior Notes due June 13, 2025 (the “3.37% Senior Notes” and together with the 3.20% Senior Notes, the “2016 Private Placement Notes”) pursuant to a Note Purchase Agreement dated June 13, 2016 (the “Purchase Agreement”). Each series of the 2016 Private Placement Notes bears interest at the stated amount per annum, which is payable semi-annually in arrears on each June 13th and December 13th. The 2016 Private Placement Notes are unsecured obligations of the Company and rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Company’s other unsecured, unsubordinated debt. The Company may at any time prepay all, or any portion of the 2016 Private Placement Notes, provided that such portion is greater than 5% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2016 Private Placement Notes then outstanding. In the event of a prepayment, the Company will pay an amount equal to par plus accrued interest plus a make-whole amount. In addition, the Company may repurchase the 2016 Private Placement Notes by making an offer to all holders of the 2016 Private Placement Notes, subject to certain conditions.  \nThe Purchase Agreement contains certain covenants that restrict the Company’s ability to, among other things, transfer or sell assets, incur indebtedness, create liens, transact with affiliates and engage in certain mergers or consolidations or other change of control transactions. In addition, the Company must comply with the leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio described above and the Purchase Agreement also limits the outstanding principal amount of priority debt that may be incurred by the Company to 15% of consolidated assets. The Purchase Agreement provides for customary events of default. In the case of an event of default arising from specified events of bankruptcy or insolvency, all of the outstanding 2016 Private Placement Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. In the case of payment event of default, any holder of the 2016 Private Placement Notes affected thereby may declare all of the 2016 Private Placement Notes held by it due and payable immediately. In the case of any other event of default, a majority of the holders of the 2016 Private Placement Notes may declare all of the 2016 Private Placement Notes to be due and payable immediately.  \n59\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

The following represent the significant collaboration agreements impacting the periods ended March 31, 2022 and 2021.Collaboration with Janssen Biotech, Inc.In December 2011, Pharmacyclics, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AbbVie, entered into a worldwide collaboration and license agreement with Janssen Biotech, Inc. and its affiliates (Janssen), one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson, for the joint development and commercialization of Imbruvica, a novel, orally active, selective covalent inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase and certain compounds structurally related to Imbruvica, for oncology and other indications, excluding all immune and inflammatory mediated diseases or conditions and all psychiatric or psychological diseases or conditions, in the United States and outside the United States.The collaboration provides Janssen with an exclusive license to commercialize Imbruvica outside of the United States and co-exclusively with AbbVie in the United States. Both parties are responsible for the development, manufacturing and marketing of any products generated as a result of the collaboration. The collaboration has no set duration or specific expiration date and provides for potential future development, regulatory and approval milestone payments of up to $200 million to AbbVie. The collaboration also includes a cost sharing arrangement for associated collaboration activities. Except in certain cases, Janssen is responsible for approximately 60% of collaboration development costs and AbbVie is responsible for the remaining 40% of collaboration development costs.In the United States, both parties have co-exclusive rights to commercialize the products; however, AbbVie is the principal in the end-customer product sales. AbbVie and Janssen share pre-tax profits and losses equally from the commercialization of products. Sales of Imbruvica are included in AbbVie's net revenues. Janssen's share of profits is included in AbbVie's cost of products sold.

The fair value of our senior notes debt is determined based on Level 2 inputs, including quoted market prices for the same or similar debt, or if no quoted market prices are available, on the current prices estimated to be available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. Carrying value approximates fair value for our term loans and commercial paper borrowings. The term loans and commercial paper borrowings were $803 million at September 30, 2022 and $3.5 billion at December 31, 2021.Put and Call Options Measured at Fair ValueOur put and call options associated with our equity method investments are measured at fair value each period using a Monte Carlo simulation. The put and call options fair values associated with our Primary Care Organization strategic partnership with WCAS, which are exercisable at a fixed revenue exit multiple and provide a minimum return on WCAS' investment if exercised, are measured at fair value each reporting period. The put and call options fair values were $190 million and $17 million, respectively, at September 30, 2022. The put and call options fair values, derived from the Monte Carlo simulation, were $202 million and $13 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021.The significant unobservable inputs utilized in these Level 3 fair value measurements (and selected values) include the enterprise value, annualized volatility and credit spread. Enterprise value was derived from a discounted cash flow model, which utilized significant unobservable inputs for long-term revenue, to measure underlying cash flows, weighted average cost of capital and long term growth rate. The table below presents the assumptions used for each reporting period.17\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

The non-contingent component of the Company’s debt guarantee arrangements is recorded at amortized cost but measured at fair value for disclosure purposes. The carrying value of the Company’s non-contingent liability of $10 million and $18 million approximates the fair value at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively (Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy). Such guarantees will be amortized in future periods over the contractual term which ends in March 2023. In addition, the Company has recorded, in conjunction with the adoption of CECL, a contingent liability ($4 million and $8 million as reported within accounts payable and accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively), representing the current expected credit losses to which the Company is exposed. This contingent liability is estimated based on certain financial metrics of the Lending Joint Ventures and historical industry data, which is used to develop assumptions of the likelihood the guaranteed parties will default and the level of credit losses in the event a default occurs (Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy). The Company recognized $12 million, $13 million and $7 million during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, within other income (expense) in its consolidated statements of income related to its release from risk under the non-contingent guarantees as well as a change in the provision of estimated credit losses associated with the indebtedness of the Lending Joint Ventures. The Company has not made any payments under the guarantees, nor has it been called upon to do so.In addition, certain of the Company’s non-financial assets are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, including property and equipment, lease ROU assets, equity securities without a readily determinable fair value, goodwill and other intangible assets, and are subject to fair value adjustment in certain circumstances. Additional information about fair value adjustments recorded on a non-recurring basis during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is included in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.   \n11. LeasesCompany as LesseeThe Company primarily leases office space, data centers and equipment from third parties. The Company determines if a contract is a lease at inception. A contract contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The lease term begins on the commencement date, which is the date the Company takes possession of the asset, and may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Many of the Company’s leases contain renewal options for varying periods, which can be exercised at the Company’s sole discretion. Leases are classified as operating or finance leases based on factors such as the lease term, lease payments, and the economic life, fair value and estimated residual value of the asset. Certain leases include options to purchase the leased asset at the end of the lease term, which is assessed as a part of the Company’s lease classification determination. The Company’s leases have remaining lease terms ranging from one month to 22 years. The Company uses the right-of-use model to account for its leases. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized on the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. ROU assets are based on the lease liability and are increased by prepaid lease payments and decreased by lease incentives received. For leases where the Company is reasonably certain to exercise a renewal option, such option periods have been included in the determination of the Company’s ROU assets and lease liabilities. Certain leases require the Company to pay taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses associated with the leased asset. Such amounts are not included in the measurement of the ROU assets and lease liabilities to the extent they are variable in nature. These variable lease costs are recognized as variable lease expenses when incurred. As a practical expedient, lease agreements with lease and non-lease components are accounted for as a single lease component for all asset classes. The Company estimates contingent lease incentives when it is probable that the Company is entitled to the incentive at lease commencement. The Company elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify. Therefore, leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets; instead, lease payments are recognized as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The depreciable life of the ROU assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term unless the Company is reasonably certain of a transfer of title or purchase option. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to discount future lease payments in the calculation of the lease liability and ROU asset based on the information available on the commencement date for each lease. The Company’s leases typically do not provide an implicit rate. The determination of the incremental borrowing rate requires judgment and is determined using the Company’s current unsecured borrowing rate, adjusted for various factors such as collateralization, currency and term to align with the terms of the lease. 73\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

In 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), a benchmark interest rate referenced in a variety of agreements, after 2021. The United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority ceased publication of U.S. Dollar LIBOR after December 31, 2021 for one-week and two-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR tenors, and expects to cease publishing after June 30, 2023 for all other U.S. Dollar LIBOR tenors. ASU 2020-04 provides entities with optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contract modifications and hedging relationships, subject to meeting certain criteria, that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. In January 2021, the FASB issued amendments to the guidance through ASU 2021-01 to include all contract modifications and hedging relationships affected by reference rate reform, including those that do not directly reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued, and clarify which optional expedients may be applied to them. The guidance can be applied prospectively. The optional relief is temporary and generally cannot be applied to contract modifications and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022. The Companies do not expect the new guidance to have a material impact on their financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  \nIn December 2021, the FASB issued amendments to the guidance on accounting for government assistance through ASU 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance. The amendments require that business entities disclose 1) the types of assistance, 2) an entity’saccounting for the assistance, and 3) the effect of the assistance on an entity’s financial statements. For public entities, the amendments are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption is permitted. The Companies have concluded the new guidance will not have a material impact on the Companies’ financial position, results of operations and liquidity.  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n52                             \n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

At December 26, 2021, the Company has loss and credit carryforwards of $175.7 million, which is a decrease of $45.9 million from $221.6 million at December 27, 2020. Loss and credit carryforwards as of December 26, 2021 relate primarily to the U.S. and Canada. The Canadian loss carryforwards expire at various dates from 2031 to 2041. Some U.S. federal and state loss and credit carryforwards expire at various dates throughout 2022 while others have an indefinite carryforward period. The recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including taxable income in prior carryback years, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. To the extent the Company does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is generally established. To the extent that a valuation allowance was established and it is subsequently determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be recovered, the change in the valuation allowance is recognized in the consolidated statements of income.The Company has a valuation allowance for certain net deferred tax assets at December 26, 2021 of $171.2 million, which is a decrease of $3.0 million from $174.2 million at December 27, 2020. The valuation allowance pertains to certain U.S. state and international loss and credit carryforwards, some of which have no expiration and 106\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

Approximately $7.1 million of Evergy's tax benefits at December 31, 2021 are related to NOLs that were acquired in the Evergy Missouri West acquisition. Due to federal limitations on the utilization of income tax attributes acquired in the Evergy Missouri West acquisition, Evergy expects a portion of these federal NOL carryforwards to expire unutilized and has provided a valuation allowance against $7.1 million of the federal income tax benefit. The federal NOL carryforwards expire in years 2023 to 2024.

Evergy Metro had deferred tax benefits of $0.2 million related to state NOLs as of 2020. The state NOL carryforwards expire in years 2022 to 2038. Evergy does not expect to utilize $5.6 million of NOLs before the expiration date of the carryforwards of NOLs in certain states. Therefore, a valuation allowance has been provided against $5.6 million of state tax benefits.148\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

GuaranteesMutual Offset Agreement. CME and Singapore Exchange Limited (SGX) maintain a mutual offset agreement with a current term through May 2023. This agreement enables market participants to open a futures position on one exchange and liquidate it on the other. The term of the agreement will automatically renew for a one-year period after May 2023 unless either party provides advance notice of their intent to terminate. CME can maintain collateral in the form of irrevocable, standby letters of credit. At June 30, 2022, CME was contingently liable to SGX on letters of credit totaling $330.0 million. CME also maintains a $350.0 million line of credit to meet its obligations under this agreement. Regardless of the collateral, CME guarantees all cleared transactions submitted through SGX and would initiate procedures designed to satisfy these financial obligations in the event of a default, such as the use of performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions of the defaulting clearing firm. Management has assessed the fair value of the company's guarantee liability under this mutual offset agreement by taking the following factors into consideration: the design and operations of the clearing risk management process, the financial safeguard packages in place, historical evidence of default by a clearing member and the estimated probability of potential payouts by the 21\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

Pursuant to the terms of the 2021 ESPP, employees purchase stock under the 2021 ESPP at a price equal to 95% of HP’s closing stock price on the purchase date. No stock-based compensation expense was recorded in connection with those purchases because the criteria of a non-compensatory plan were met. The aggregate number of shares of HP’s stock authorized for issuance under the 2021 ESPP was 50 million. The 2021 ESPP came into effect on May 1, 2021 upon expiry of the 2011 ESPP. The 2021 ESPP terms are similar to the previous ESPP.

Cadence has elected to exclude the potential future royalty receipts from the remaining performance obligations. Contracted but unsatisfied performance obligations were approximately $4.4 billion as of January 1, 2022, which included $119.5 million of non-cancellable IPAA commitments from customers where actual product selection and quantities of specific products or services are to be determined by customers at a later date. As of January 1, 2022, Cadence expected to recognize approximately 55% of the contracted but unsatisfied performance obligations, excluding non-cancellable IPAA commitments, as revenue over the next 12 months and the remainder thereafter.Cadence recognized revenue of $47.1 million, $51.2 million and $40.4 million during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods. These amounts represent royalties earned during the period and exclude contracts with nonrefundable prepaid royalties. Nonrefundable prepaid royalties are recognized upon delivery of the IP because Cadence’s right to the consideration is not contingent upon customers’ future shipments.NOTE 6. ACQUISITIONS 2021 AcquisitionsOn February 23, 2021, Cadence acquired all of the outstanding equity of Belgium-based Numerical Mechanics Applications International SA (“NUMECA”). The addition of NUMECA’s technologies and talent supports Cadence’s Intelligent System Design™ strategy, servicing the computational fluid dynamics (“CFD”) market segment as part of System Design and Analysis. The aggregate cash consideration for Cadence’s acquisition of NUMECA, net of cash acquired of $9.6 million, was $188.6 million. Cadence expects to recognize expense for consideration paid to certain former NUMECA shareholders that is subject to service and other conditions, through the first quarter of fiscal 2023.The total purchase consideration was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with Cadence’s acquisition of NUMECA based on their respective estimated fair values on the acquisition date as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|   | Acquisition Date Fair Value |\n|   | (In thousands) |\n| Current assets | $ | 16,423  |  |\n| Goodwill | 133,077  |  |\n| Acquired intangibles | 72,200  |  |\n| Other long-term assets | 6,928  |  |\n| Total assets acquired | 228,628  |  |\n| Current liabilities | 9,951  |  |\n| Long-term liabilities | 20,475  |  |\n| Total liabilities assumed | 30,426  |  |\n| Total purchase consideration | $ | 198,202  |  |\n\nThe recorded goodwill is attributed to intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, including the acquired assembled workforce and expected synergies from combining operations of NUMECA with Cadence. Cadence expects all of the goodwill related to the acquisition of NUMECA to be deductible for tax purposes.On April 14, 2021, Cadence acquired all of the outstanding equity of Pointwise, Inc. (“Pointwise”), a leader in mesh generation for CFD for cash consideration of approximately $31.4 million, net of cash acquired. The addition of Pointwise’s technologies and experienced team supports Cadence’s Intelligent System Design strategy and further broadens its System Design and Analysis portfolio, complementing its acquisition of NUMECA. The total purchase consideration was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values on the acquisition dates. Cadence recorded $16.7 million of definite-lived intangible assets and $16.7 million of goodwill with its acquisition of Pointwise. All of the goodwill related to Cadence’s acquisition of Pointwise is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.Cadence completed two additional acquisitions during fiscal 2021. These acquisitions are not material to the consolidated financial statements.64\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

A maximum of 127,000,000 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares are currently authorized for awards under the Amended 2010 SIP. As of August 31, 2022, there were 27,381,461 shares available for future grants. Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares covered by awards that terminate, lapse or are cancelled may again be used to satisfy awards under the Amended 2010 SIP.

The fair value of the awards is based on our stock price on the date of grant. The restricted share units granted under these plans are subject to cliff or graded vesting, generally ranging from two to five years. For awards with graded vesting, compensation expense is recognized over the vesting term of each separately vesting portion. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis for awards with cliff vesting.

Sometimes plaintiffs seek substantial damages. Significant judgment is required in predicting the outcome of these suits and claims, many of which take years to adjudicate. We accrue estimated costs for a contingency when we believe that a loss is probable and we can make a reasonable estimate of the loss, and then adjust the accrual as appropriate to reflect changes in facts and circumstances. We do not believe it is reasonably possible that these existing loss contingencies, individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. No material accrued loss contingencies are recorded as of April 30, 2022.In May 2019, we notified Bacardi Martini Ltd. (Bacardi) of our intention not to renew the terms of our United Kingdom (U.K.) Cost Sharing Agreement (the Agreement), which then expired according to its terms on April 30, 2020. Following delivery of our notice and upon expiration of the Agreement, Bacardi claimed that it was entitled to compensation under the principle of commercial agency in the U.K., as well as additional compensation for the winding up of business conducted under the Agreement and for remitting the associated funds owed to us. Based on that claim, which we disputed, Bacardi withheld over £50 owed to us (included in accounts receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of April 30, 2021).

The goodwill assigned to the Investor Services and Advisor Services segments were $6.4 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively.  \nThe Company’s consolidated statements of income include total net revenues and net income attributable to the TD Ameritrade acquisition of $1.7 billion and $583 million, respectively, for the period October 6, 2020 through December 31, 2020.   \nIn connection with the TD Ameritrade acquisition, the Company incurred various professional fees and other costs such as advisory, legal, and accounting fees. In total, the Company incurred acquisition costs of $56 million and $11 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which are primarily included in professional services on the consolidated statements of income.   \nUSAA-IMCO  \nOn May 26, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of the assets of USAA-IMCO for $1.6 billion in cash. Along with the asset purchase agreement, the companies entered into a long-term referral agreement that makes Schwab the exclusive provider of wealth management and investment brokerage services for USAA members. The USAA-IMCO acquisition has added scale to the Company’s operations through the addition of over one million brokerage and managed portfolio accounts with approximately $80 billion in client assets at the acquisition date. The transaction also provides Schwab the opportunity to further expand our client base by serving USAA’s members through the long-term referral agreement.  \nThe Company accounted for the USAA-IMCO acquisition as a business combination under GAAP and accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the date of acquisition. During the three months ended September 30, 2020, we made a $43 million post-closing adjustment to the purchase price resulting in reductions of $9 million and $34 million to our initial estimates of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired and goodwill, respectively. The Company finalized the valuation of assets and liabilities during the three months ended December 31, 2020, resulting in no additional adjustments to the estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition.  \n- 77 -\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

In 2020, we sold an aggregate of approximately 3.7 million shares of Agenus Inc.’s common stock resulting in gross proceeds of approximately $17.2 million. In 2021, we sold an aggregate of approximately 2.0 million shares of Agenus Inc.’s common stock resulting in gross proceeds of approximately $10.5 million. The fair market value of our long term investment in Agenus Inc. at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was $24.8 million and $38.9 million, respectively.We intend to hold the investment in Agenus Inc. for the foreseeable future and therefore, are accounting for our shares held in Agenus Inc. at fair value whereby the investment is marked to market through earnings in each reporting period. Given our intent to hold the investment for the foreseeable future, we have classified the investment within long term investments on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, we recorded an unrealized gain of $1.3 million and an unrealized loss of $14.1 million, respectively, based on the change in fair value of Agenus Inc.’s common stock during the respective periods. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, we recorded an unrealized loss of $2.8 million and an unrealized gain of $29.1 million, respectively, based on the change in fair value of Agenus Inc.’s common stock during the respective periods. MerusIn December 2016, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Merus N.V. (“Merus”). Under this agreement, the parties have agreed to collaborate with respect to the research, discovery and development of bispecific antibodies utilizing Merus’ technology platform. The collaboration encompasses up to ten independent programs. In January 2022, we decided to opt-out of the continued development of MCLA-145, a bispecific antibody targeting PD-L1 and CD137. We continue to collaborate with Merus and leverage the Merus platform to develop a pipeline of novel agents, as we continue to hold worldwide exclusive development and commercialization rights to up to ten additional programs. Of these ten additional programs, Merus retained the option, subject to certain conditions, to co-fund development of up to two such programs. If Merus exercises its co-funding option for a program, Merus would be responsible for funding 35% of the associated future global development costs and, for certain of such programs, would be responsible for reimbursing us for certain development costs incurred prior to the option exercise. Merus will also have the right to participate in a specified proportion of detailing activities in the United States for one of those co-developed programs. All costs related to the co-funded collaboration programs are subject to joint research and development plans and overseen by a joint development committee, but we will have final determination as to such plans in cases of dispute. We will be responsible for all research, development and commercialization costs relating to all other programs. For each program as to which Merus does not have commercialization or development co-funding rights, Merus is eligible to receive up to $100.0 million in future contingent development and regulatory milestones, and up to $250.0 million in commercialization milestones as well as tiered royalties ranging from 6% to 10% of global net sales. For each program as to which Merus exercises its option to co-fund development, Merus is eligible to receive a 50% share of profits (or sustain 50% of any losses) in the United States and be eligible to receive tiered royalties ranging from 6% to 10% of net sales of products outside of the United States. If Merus opts to cease co-funding a program as to which it exercised its co-development option, then Merus will no longer receive a share of profits in the United States but will be eligible to receive the same milestones from the co-funding termination date and the same tiered royalties described above with respect to programs where Merus does not have a right to co-fund development and, depending on the stage at which Merus chose to cease co-funding development costs, Merus will be eligible to receive additional royalties ranging up to 4% of net sales in the United States. As of September 30, 2022, we have paid Merus milestones totaling $3.0 million.In addition, in 2016 we entered into a Share Subscription Agreement with Merus, pursuant to which we purchased 3.2 million common shares of Merus for an aggregate purchase price of $80.0 million in cash, or $25.00 per share. In January 2021, we purchased 350,000 common shares in Merus’ underwritten public offering of 4,848,485 common shares at the public offering price of $24.75 per share, or an aggregate purchase price of $8.7 million. The fair market value of our total long term investment in Merus at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was $71.1 million and $112.9 million, respectively.

The Company recorded equity earnings, net of taxes, of $311 million, $48 million, and $207 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, for Ilim. Foreign exchange gains (losses) included in equity earnings in 2021, were not material and JSC Ilim Group had no U.S. dollar-denominated debt outstanding as of December 31, 2021. Equity earnings includes an after-tax foreign exchange (loss) gain of $(50) million, and $32 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, primarily on the remeasurement of U.S. dollar-denominated net debt. The Company received cash dividends from the joint venture of $154 million, $141 million and $246 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company's investment in Ilim, which is recorded in Investments in the consolidated balance sheet, was $557 million and $393 million, respectively, which was $121 million and $127 million, respectively, more than the Company's proportionate share of the joint venture's underlying net assets.   \nThe differences primarily relate to currency translation adjustments and the basis difference between the fair value of our investment at acquisition and the underlying net assets. Prior to the spin-off of the Printing Papers segment on October 1, 2021, the Company was party to a joint marketing agreement with JSC Ilim Group, a subsidiary of Ilim, under which the Company purchased, marketed and sold paper produced by JSC Ilim Group. Purchases under this agreement were $125 million, $174 million and $215 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.The joint marketing agreement 65\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

RSUs provide for dividend equivalents payable in additional RSUs for dividends that would have been paid during the vesting period. Stock option exercise prices are equal to the common stock fair market value on the date of grant. The Company estimates forfeitures based on historical rates for awards with similar characteristics. The Company uses a binomial option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the stock options granted. The following summarizes the assumptions used in the option valuations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:  \n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | 2021 |  | 2020 |  | 2019 |\n| Risk-free interest rate | 0.04-1.38% |  | 1.41-1.59% |  | 2.50%-2.68% |\n| Weighted-average volatility | 24.0% |  | 21.0% |  | 22.0% |\n| Dividend yield | 2.50% |  | 2.56% |  | 2.20% |\n| Expected years until exercise | 8.9-9.4 |  | 9.1-9.6 |  | 8.7-9.0 |\n\n  \nLattice-based option valuation models, such as the binomial option pricing model, incorporate ranges of assumptions for inputs. The risk-free rate of interest for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on a zero-coupon U.S. government instrument over the contractual term of the equity instrument. Expected volatility is based on implied volatility from traded options on the Company's stock and historical volatility of the Company's stock. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise timing and employee termination rates within the valuation model. The weighted-average dividend yield is based on historical information. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The ranges presented result from separate groups of employees assumed to exhibit different exercise behavior.  \n71\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

The allowance for receivables represents our best estimate of the probable losses associated with potential customer defaults. We determine the allowance based on historical experience, current collection trends, and external business factors such as economic factors, including regional bankruptcy rates, and political factors. The change in allowance for doubtful accounts for both current trade receivables and long-term receivables is representative of the impairment of receivables as of September 30, 2022. Refer to Note 6 for further information.The amount of revenue recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 that was included in the opening contract liability balance is $627.4 million.We periodically enter into prepayment arrangements with customers and receive advance payments for product to be delivered in future periods. Prepayment terms are extended to customers/distributors in order to capitalize on surplus cash with growers. Growers receive bulk payments for their produce, which they leverage to buy our products from distributors through prepayment options. This in turn creates opportunity for distributors to make large prepayments to us for securing the future supply of products to be sold to growers. Prepayments are typically received in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and are for the following marketing year indicating that the time difference between prepayment and performance of corresponding performance obligations does not exceed one year.We recognize these prepayments as a liability under \"Advance payments from customers\" on the condensed consolidated balance sheets when they are received. Revenue associated with advance payments is recognized as shipments are made and transfer of control to the customer takes place. Advance payments from customers were $630.7 million as of December 31, 2021 and $3.3 million as of September 30, 2022.Manufacturing and Seed Supply AgreementsAs part of the DuPont Crop Protection Business Acquisition in 2017, we acquired various manufacturing contracts. The manufacturing contracts have been recognized as an asset or liability to the extent the terms of the contract were favorable or unfavorable compared with market terms of the same or similar items at the date of the acquisition. We also entered into supply agreements with DuPont, with terms of up to five years, to supply technical insecticide products required for their retained seed treatment business at cost. The unfavorable liability is recorded within \"Accrued and other liabilities\" on the condensed consolidated balance sheets and is reduced and recognized to revenues within earnings as sales are made. The amount recognized in revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 was approximately $82 million and $77 million, and $28 million and $26 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.The manufacturing contracts and supply agreements discussed above ended on October 31, 2022 at the end of the five year term and as such, the unfavorable liability has been fully recognized and reduced to zero.   \nNote 4: Goodwill and Intangible Assets The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are presented in the table below:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| (in Millions) |  |  |  |  |  |  | Total |\n| Balance, December 31, 2021 |  |  |  |  |  |  | $ | 1,463.3  |  |\n| Acquisitions (See Note 5) |  |  |  |  |  |  | 130.7  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Foreign currency and other adjustments |  |  |  |  |  |  | (19.9) |  |\n| Balance, September 30, 2022 |  |  |  |  |  |  | $ | 1,574.1  |  |\n\n  \nWe perform our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests at least annually.

In March 2021, the ICC issued an order allowing Ameren Illinois to resume disconnection activities for all residential customers through a phased-in approach, which began in April 2021 for customers with the largest past due balances and in June 2021 for all remaining residential customers. The March 2021 order also required Ameren Illinois to offer deferred payment arrangements extending to 18 months to all residential customers through June 2021. In addition, the order requires Ameren Illinois to extend the financial assistance program established by a June 2020 ICC order through 2021. Ameren Illinois is allowed to recover up to $4 million in costs incurred during 2021 related to this financial assistance program. These costs will be deferred as regulatory assets and the portion associated with Ameren Illinois’ electric distribution business will be recovered through its bad debt rider and the portion associated with its natural gas distribution business will be recovered through a special purpose rider.FederalTransmission Formula Rate RevisionsIn February 2020, the MISO, on behalf of Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI, filed requests with the FERC to revise each company’s transmission formula rate calculations with respect to the calculation used for materials and supplies inventories included in rate base. In May 2020, the FERC issued orders approving the revisions prospectively. In addition, the FERC declined to order refunds for earlier periods, as requested by intervenors in Ameren Illinois’ filing, but directed its audit staff to review historical rate recovery in connection with an ongoing FERC audit. In June 2020, Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI filed requests for rehearing arguing, among other things, the revisions should be applied retrospectively to include the period January 1, 2019, to June 1, 2020, and that the FERC should not require refunds for periods prior to 2019. In July 2020, the FERC denied the rehearing requests without addressing the issues raised. In July 2020, Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI filed an appeal of the July 2020 rehearing denials to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which is under no deadline to address the appeal. In October 2020, the FERC issued an order reaffirming its May 2020 order and denying the arguments raised in the rehearing requests filed by Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI. In November 2020, Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI filed an appeal of the October 2020 order to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The court of appeals is under no deadline to address either appeal. Regardless of the outcome of the appeal, the impacts of the May 2020 and October 2020 orders were immaterial to Ameren’s, Ameren Missouri’s, or Ameren Illinois’ results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.In March 2021, the FERC issued an order related to an intervenor challenge to Ameren Illinois’ 2020 transmission formula rate update. As a result of this order, in March 2021, Ameren Illinois recorded a regulatory liability of $9 million, largely as a reduction of electric operating revenues, to reflect expected refunds, including interest, primarily related to the historical rate recovery of materials and supplies inventories included in rate base. In April 2021, Ameren Illinois filed a request for rehearing with the FERC regarding its March 2021 order. In May 2021, the FERC denied the rehearing request without addressing the issues raised. In July 2021, Ameren Illinois filed an appeal of the March 2021 order and the May 2021 rehearing denial to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In August 2021, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit granted a motion to consolidate the July 2021, July 2020, and November 2020 appeals. In November 2021, the FERC issued an order reaffirming its March 2021 order and denying the arguments raised in the rehearing request filed by Ameren Illinois. In December 2021, Ameren Illinois filed an appeal of the November 2021 order to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In December 2021, Ameren Illinois filed a motion to consolidate the December 2021 appeal with the July 2020, November 2020, and July 2021 appeals. In January 2022, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issued an order granting the motion to consolidate the appeals. The court is under no deadline to address the appeal.FERC Complaint CasesIn November 2013, a customer group filed a complaint case with the FERC seeking a reduction in the allowed base ROE for FERC-regulated transmission rate base under the MISO tariff from 12.38% to 9.15%. In September 2016, the FERC issued an order in the November 2013 complaint case, which lowered the allowed base ROE to 10.32%, or a 10.82% total allowed ROE with the inclusion of a 50 basis point incentive adder for participation in an RTO, that was effective from late September 2016 forward. The September 2016 order also required refunds for the period November 2013 to February 2015, which were paid in 2017. In November 2019, the FERC issued an order addressing the November 2013 complaint case, which set the allowed base ROE at 9.88%, superseding the 10.32% previously ordered, and required refunds, with interest, for the periods November 2013 to February 2015 and from late September 2016 forward. In December 2019, the MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI, filed requests for rehearing with the FERC. In May 2020, the FERC issued an order addressing the requests for rehearing, which set the allowed base ROE at 10.02%, superseding the 9.88% previously ordered, and required refunds, with interest, for the periods November 2013 to February 2015 and from late September 2016 forward. In June 2020, various parties filed requests for rehearing with the FERC, challenging the new ROE methodology established by the May 2020 order. In July 2020, the FERC denied the rehearing requests without addressing the issues raised, and indicated it will address the requests for rehearing in a future order.

Effective April 1, 2021, we discontinued the majority of our factoring programs and subsequently announced the discontinuation of our remaining unconsolidated receivables facility effective in the fourth quarter of 2021. The remaining balance related to these discontinued programs was $161 million as of December 31, 2021. As shown in the table below, WCS no longer holds any GE business receivables. Customer receivables held by WCS and third parties were $3,134 million and $2,582 million, respectively, at March 31, 2021. When GE businesses sell customer receivables to WCS or third parties, they accelerate the receipt of cash that would otherwise have been collected from customers. In any given period, the amount of cash received from sales of customer receivables compared to the cash GE would have otherwise collected had those customer receivables not been sold represents the cash generated or used in the period relating to this activity. As of December 31, 2020, GE businesses sold approximately 40% of their gross customer receivables to WCS or third parties. Separately from the factoring programs that have been discontinued, the Company from time to time sells current or long-term receivables to third parties in response to customer-sponsored requests or programs, to facilitate sales, or for risk mitigation purposes.

The Company recognized goodwill of $967 (none of which is expected to be tax deductible), identifiable intangible assets of $783, primarily intellectual property and customer relationships with a weighted-average useful life of approximately 11 years, and deferred tax liabilities of $193. Results of operations for the year ended September 30, 2021 included first year pretax acquisition accounting charges related to backlog amortization and deferred revenue of $30 and $14, respectively, and fees of $6.  \nIn 2020, the Company acquired three businesses, two in the Automation Solutions segment and one in the Climate Technologies segment, for $126, net of cash acquired.

The Company recognized goodwill of $209 ($155 of which is expected to be tax deductible) and other identifiable intangible assets of $158, primarily customer relationships and intellectual property with a weighted-average useful life of approximately nine years.   \nAs previously disclosed, the Company sold its network power systems business (rebranded as Vertiv, now a publicly traded company, symbol VRT) in 2017 and retained a subordinated interest contingent upon the equity holders first receiving a threshold return on their initial investment. Subsequent to September 30, 2021, the equity holders received a return on their investment in excess of the threshold. Based on the terms of the agreement and the current calculation, the Company could receive approximately $600 on a pretax basis through periodic distributions over the next two years, of which $438 was received in November 2021. However, the remaining distributions are contingent on the timing and price at which Vertiv shares are sold by the equity holders and therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of the remaining distributions to the Company.

The change in 2020 was primarily due to special advisory fees of $13. (6) RESTRUCTURING COSTSEach year the Company incurs costs to size its businesses to levels appropriate for current economic conditions and to continually improve its cost structure and operational efficiency, deploy assets globally, and remain competitive on a worldwide basis. Costs result from numerous individual actions implemented across the Company's various operating units on an ongoing basis and can include costs for moving facilities to best-cost locations, restarting plants after relocation or geographic expansion to better serve local markets, reducing forcecount or the number of facilities, exiting certain product lines, and other costs resulting from asset deployment decisions (such as contract termination costs, asset write-downs and vacant facility costs). Restructuring expenses were $150, $284 and $95 for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

The sales agreement provides that, in addition to the issuance and sale of shares of Entergy common stock, Entergy may enter into forward sale agreements for the sale of its common stock. The aggregate number of shares of common stock sold under this sales agreement and under any forward sale agreement may not exceed an aggregate gross sales price of $1 billion.   \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, Entergy Corporation issued 1,930,330 shares of common stock under the at the market equity distribution program. The net sales proceeds from these shares totaled $200.8 million, which includes the gross sales price of $204.2 million received by Entergy Corporation less $1.4 million of general issuance costs and $2.0 million of aggregate compensation to the agents with respect to such sales.   \nIn June, August, and October 2021, Entergy entered into forward sale agreements for 416,853 shares, 1,692,555 shares, and 250,743 shares of common stock, respectively. No amounts have or will be recorded on Entergy’s balance sheet with respect to the equity offering until settlements of the equity forward sale agreements occur. The forward sale agreements require Entergy to, at its election prior to September 30, 2022, either (i) physically settle the transactions by issuing the total of 416,853 shares, 1,692,555 shares, and 250,743 shares, respectively, of its common stock to the forward counterparties in exchange for net proceeds at the then-applicable forward sale price specified by the agreements (initially approximately $106.87, $111.16, and $100.35 per share, respectively) or (ii) net settle the transactions in whole or in part through the delivery or receipt of cash or shares. The forward sale price is subject to adjustment on a daily basis based on a floating interest rate factor and will decrease by other fixed amounts specified in the agreements. In connection with the forward sale agreements, the forward seller, or its affiliates, borrowed from third parties and sold 416,853 shares, 1,692,555 shares, and 250,743 shares, respectively, of Entergy Corporation’s common stock. The gross sales price of these shares totaled $45 million, $190.1 million, and $25.4 million, respectively. In connection with the sales of these shares, Entergy paid to the agents fees of $0.5 million, $1.9 million, and $0.3 million, respectively, which have not been deducted from the gross sales prices. Entergy did not receive any proceeds from such sales of borrowed shares.  \nUntil settlement of the forward sale agreements, earnings per share dilution resulting from the agreements, if any, will be determined under the treasury stock method. Share dilution occurs when the average market price of Entergy’s common stock is higher than the average forward sales price. At December 31, 2021, 1,158,917 shares under the forward sale agreements were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their effect would have been antidilutive.  \nEquity Forward Sale Agreements  \nIn June 2018, Entergy marketed an equity offering of 15.3 million shares of common stock. In lieu of issuing equity at the time of the offering, Entergy entered into forward sale agreements with various investment banks. The equity forwards required Entergy to, at its election prior to June 7, 2019, either (i) physically settle the transactions by issuing the total of 15.3 million shares of its common stock to the investment banks in exchange for net proceeds at the then-applicable forward sale price specified by the agreements (initially $74.45 per share) or (ii) net settle the transactions in whole or in part through the delivery or receipt of cash or shares. The forward sale price was subject to adjustment on a daily basis based on a floating interest rate factor and decreased by other fixed amounts specified in the agreements.   \nIn December 2018, Entergy physically settled a portion of its obligations under the forward sale agreements by delivering 6,834,221 shares of common stock in exchange for cash proceeds of $500 million.

The impacts of these accelerated share repurchase transactions were as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Execution Date |  | Settlement Date |  | Aggregate Common Stock Repurchased (millions of dollars) |  | Initial Shares Delivered (in thousands) |  | Additional Shares Delivered at Settlement (in thousands) (a) |  | Total Shares Delivered (in thousands) |\n| Q3 2021 |  | Q4 2021 |  | $ | 500  |  |  | 1,658  |  |  | 403 |  | 2,062  |  |\n| Q4 2021 |  | Q1 2022 |  | 750  |  |  | 2,515  |  |  | 462 |  | 2,977  |  |\n\n(a) Upon final settlement of each repurchase agreement and the forward sale contract, the Company’s receipt of additional shares was recorded as an increase to Common stock in treasury and an offsetting increase to Capital in excess of par value. The final settlement for the fourth quarter transaction amounted to $150 million.The Company also repurchased approximately 2.066 million shares of its common stock during fiscal year 2021 through open market repurchases, which were recorded as a $500 million increase to Common stock in treasury. The share repurchases discussed above were made pursuant to the repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors on September 24, 2013 for 10 million shares, for which there is no expiration date. In November 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to an additional 10 million shares of BD common stock, for which there is no expiration date.Common and Preferred Stock Conversions and OfferingsIn accordance with their terms, the Company's 2.475 million mandatory convertible preferred shares that were issued in May 2017 in connection with the Company's acquisition of Bard were converted into 11.703 million shares of BD common stock on the mandatory conversion date of May 1, 2020.Also in May 2020, the Company completed registered public offerings of equity securities including:•6.250 million shares of the Company's common stock for net proceeds of $1.459 billion (gross proceeds of $1.500 billion).•1.500 million shares of the Company's mandatory convertible preferred stock (ownership is held in the form of depositary shares, each representing a 1/20th interest in a share of preferred stock) for net proceeds of $1.459 billion (gross proceeds of $1.500 billion). If and when declared, dividends on the mandatory convertible preferred stock will be payable on a cumulative basis at an annual rate of 6.00% on the liquidation preference of $1,000 per preferred share ($50 per depositary share). The shares of preferred stock are convertible to a minimum of 5.2 million and up to a maximum of 6.2 million shares of Company common stock at an exchange ratio, based on the market price of the Company’s common stock at the date of conversion, and no later than the mandatory conversion date of June 1, 2023.65\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

The redemption date was on February 16, 2021 and resulted in an insignificant loss due to extinguishment.Revolving Credit FacilitiesAs of September 30, 2022, Aon had two primary committed credit facilities outstanding: its $1.0 billion multi-currency U.S. credit facility expiring in September 2026 and its $750 million multi-currency U.S. credit facility expiring in October 2023. In aggregate, these two facilities provide approximately $1.8 billion in available credit. Effective October 19, 2022, the expiration date of the $750 million multi-currency U.S. credit facility was extended one year to October 2024. Each of these primary committed credit facilities includes customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including financial covenants that require Aon to maintain specified ratios of adjusted consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense and consolidated debt to adjusted consolidated EBITDA, in each case, tested quarterly. At September 30, 2022, Aon did not have borrowings under either of these primary committed credit facilities, and was in compliance with the financial covenants and all other covenants contained therein during the rolling 12 months ended September 30, 2022.Commercial PaperAon Corporation has established a U.S. commercial paper program (the “U.S. Program”) and Aon Global Holdings plc has established a European multi-currency commercial paper program (the “European Program” and, together with the U.S. Program, the “Commercial Paper Programs”). Commercial paper may be issued in aggregate principal amounts of up to $1.0 billion under the U.S. Program and €625 million ($601 million at September 30, 2022 exchange rates) under the European Program, not to exceed the amount of the Company’s committed credit facilities, which was approximately $1.8 billion at September 30, 2022. The U.S. Program is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Aon plc, Aon Global Limited, and Aon Global Holdings plc and the European Program is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Aon plc, Aon Global Limited, and Aon Corporation.Commercial paper outstanding, which is included in Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, is as follows (in millions):\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | September 30, 2022 | December 31, 2021 |\n| Commercial paper outstanding | $ | 211  |  | $ | 665  |  |\n\nThe weighted average commercial paper outstanding and its related interest rates are as follows (in millions, except percentages):\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  | Three Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, |\n|  |  | 2022 |  | 2021 | 2022 |  | 2021 |\n| Weighted average commercial paper outstanding |  | $ | 483  |  |  | $ | 386  |  | $ | 476  |  |  | $ | 157  |  |\n| Weighted average interest rate of commercial paper outstanding |  | 1.66  | % |  | 0.09  | % | 0.69  | % |  | 0.11  | % |\n\n9. Income TaxesThe effective tax rate on Net income was 18.0% and 19.1% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively. The effective tax rate on Net income (loss) was (2.6)% and 51.4% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, the quarter-to-date tax rate was primarily driven by the geographical distribution of income and certain discrete items. The year-to-date tax rate was primarily driven by the geographical distribution of income and certain discrete items, primarily the favorable impacts of share-based payments.For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, the quarter-to-date tax rate was primarily driven by the impact of the $1 billion payment made in connection with the termination of the proposed combination with WTW (the “Termination Fee”). The year-to-date tax rate was primarily driven by the Termination Fee, the U.K. tax rate increase, and the tax benefit of share-based payments. The U.K. enacted legislation on June 10, 2021, which increased the corporate income tax rate from 19% to 25% with effect from April 1, 2023, and the Company remeasured its U.K. deferred tax assets and liabilities accordingly.18\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually at various dates. Each series of the senior notes is redeemable, at our option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time-to-time at the redemption prices set forth in the related indenture.  \nOn August 22, 2022, we issued $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes consisting of the following: (i) $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.950% senior notes due August 2027; (ii) $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.300% senior notes due August 2029; (iii) $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.400% senior notes due August 2032; and (iv) $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.950% senior notes due August 2052. We issued the senior notes at a total discount of $5.2 million, and we incurred debt issuance costs of $24.8 million, including underwriting fees, fees for professional services and registration fees, which were capitalized and reflected as a reduction of the related carrying amount of the notes in our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2022. Interest on the senior unsecured notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing February 15, 2023. The notes are unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other outstanding unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The net proceeds from the offering have been or will be used to refinance the outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility, to make cash payments and pay transaction fees and expenses in connection with the pending acquisition of EVO, to refinance certain outstanding indebtedness of EVO in connection with the acquisition and for general corporate purposes. In the event that the EVO acquisition is not consummated, we will be required to redeem the notes due 2027 and 2029 at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes due 2027 and 2029 then outstanding plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.  \nConvertible Notes  \nOn August 1, 2022, we entered into an investment agreement with Silver Lake Partners relating to the issuance of $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of 1.000% convertible unsecured senior notes (the \"Convertible Notes”) due 2029 in a private placement, and the transaction closed on August 8, 2022.

At December 31, 2021, based on applicable prices on that date, FCX has unconditional purchase obligations (including take-or-pay contracts with terms less than one year) of $4.3 billion, primarily comprising the procurement of copper concentrate ($3.1 billion), transportation services ($0.4 billion) and electricity ($0.3 billion). Some of FCX’s unconditional purchase obligations are settled based on the prevailing market rate for the service or commodity purchased. In some cases, the amount of the actual obligation may change over time because of market conditions. Obligations for copper concentrate provide for deliveries of specified volumes to Atlantic Copper at market-based prices. Transportation obligations are primarily for South America contracted ocean freight. Electricity obligations are primarily for long-term power purchase agreements in North America and contractual minimum demand at the South America mines.   \nFCX’s unconditional purchase obligations by year total $1.6 billion in 2022, $1.5 billion in 2023, $0.5 billion in 2024, $0.2 billion in 2025, $0.2 billion in 2026 and $0.3 billion thereafter.

On December 21, 2018, FCX completed the transaction with the Indonesia government regarding PT-FI’s long-term mining rights and share ownership. Concurrent with the closing of the transaction, the Indonesia government granted PT-FI an IUPK to replace its former COW, enabling PT-FI to conduct operations in the Grasberg minerals district through 2041. Under the terms of the IUPK, PT-FI has been granted an extension of mining rights through 2031, with rights to extend mining rights through 2041, subject to PT-FI completing the development of additional smelting capacity in Indonesia by the end of 2023 (an extension of which has been requested due to COVID-19 mitigation measures subject to the approval of the Indonesia government, refer to Note 12), and fulfilling its defined fiscal obligations to the Indonesia government. The IUPK, and related documentation, contains legal and fiscal terms and is legally enforceable through 2041, assuming the additional extension is received. In addition, FCX, as a foreign investor, has rights to resolve investment disputes with the Indonesia government through international arbitration.  \nThe key fiscal terms set forth in the IUPK include a 25 percent corporate income tax rate, a 10 percent profits tax on net income, and royalty rates of 4 percent for copper, 3.75 percent for gold and 3.25 percent for silver. PT-FI’s royalties totaled $319 million in 2021, $160 million in 2020 and $106 million in 2019.   \nDividend distributions from PT-FI to FCX totaled $1.0 billion in 2021 and are subject to a 10 percent withholding tax. There were no dividend distributions from PT-FI to FCX in 2020 or 2019.  \nThe IUPK requires PT-FI to pay export duties of 5 percent, declining to 2.5 percent when smelter development progress exceeds 30 percent and eliminated when development progress for additional smelting capacity in Indonesia exceeds 50 percent.

{"question": "Payment of contingent consideration for previously acquired businesses", "answer": "11,328", "task": "SEC-NUM", "context": "\n[Table of Contents](exhibit311q32022.htm)As part of the acquisition of Emakina, the Company acquired rights to purchase certain noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries of Emakina in exchange for future cash payments determined by the future profitability of certain subsidiaries. The Company determines the fair value of these rights by (i) estimating the fair value of the noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries by applying an EBITDA multiple adjusted for a lack of control and marketability, less (ii) the fair value of expected future payments to settle the related contractual obligations. The Company purchased the majority of the noncontrolling interest in consolidated subsidiaries during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The Company determines the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities using Monte Carlo simulations or probability-weighted expected return methods. The fair value of the contingent consideration for the PolSource acquisition attributable to future revenues and earnings was measured utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation, based on future revenue and earnings projections of the business, revenue volatility and asset volatility of comparable companies, and a discount rate. The discount rate used to determine the fair value of this contingent consideration was 0.4% as of the acquisition date. The fair value of the contingent consideration for the PolSource acquisition attributable to future operating metrics was measured using a probability-weighted expected return method, based on the expected future payments using the earnout formula and performance targets specified in the purchase agreement and adjusting those estimates to reflect the probability of their achievement. The weighted-average estimated future payments were then discounted to present value using a rate based on EPAM’s cost of debt. The discount rate used to determine the fair value of this contingent consideration was 0.4% as of the acquisition date.The fair value of the contingent consideration for all other acquisitions was determined using a probability-weighted expected return method and is based on the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired businesses in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements. Although there is significant judgment involved, the Company believes its estimates and assumptions are reasonable. In determining fair value, the Company considered a variety of factors, including future performance of the acquired businesses using financial projections developed by the Company and market risk assumptions that were derived for revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxes. The Company estimated future payments using the earnout formula and performance targets specified in the purchase agreements and adjusted those estimates to reflect the probability of their achievement. Those weighted-average estimated future payments were then discounted to present value using a rate based on the weighted-average cost of capital of guideline companies. The discount rate used to determine the fair value of contingent consideration for the 2022 Acquisitions ranged from a minimum of 13.0% to a maximum of 15.0%. The discount rate used to determine the fair value of contingent consideration for the CORE acquisition was 13.0%. The discount rates used to determine the fair value of contingent consideration for the Other 2021 Acquisitions ranged from a minimum of 15.0% to a maximum of 22.0%. Changes in financial projections, market risk assumptions, discount rates or probability assumptions related to achieving the various earnout criteria would result in a change in the fair value of the recorded contingent liabilities. Such changes, if any, are recorded within Interest and other income/(loss), net in the Company’s condensed consolidated statement of income.A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of Level 3 acquisition-related contingent consideration using significant unobservable inputs for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 is as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  | Amount |\n| Contingent consideration liabilities as of January 1, 2022 |  | $ | 23,114  |  |\n| Acquisition date fair value of contractual contingent liabilities - 2022 Acquisitions |  | 2,645  |  |\n| Changes in fair value of contingent consideration included in Interest and other income/(loss), net |  | 8,520  |  |\n| Payment of contingent consideration for previously acquired businesses |  | (11,328) |  |\n| Effect of net foreign currency exchange rate changes |  | (2,099) |  |\n| Contingent consideration liabilities as of September 30, 2022 |  | $ | 20,852  |  |\n\nSee Note 2, “Impact of the Invasion of Ukraine” for discussion of the nonrecurring level 3 fair value assessment used in the impairment tests of long-lived assets in Russia.  \n 16\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES On August 11, 2022, we completed the sale of a 60% interest of Humana’s Kindred at Home Hospice subsidiary, or KAH Hospice, to Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, or CD&R, for cash proceeds of approximately $2.7 billion, net of cash disposed, including debt repayments from KAH Hospice to Humana of $1.9 billion. In connection with the sale we recognized a pre-tax gain, net of transaction costs, of $240 million which is reported as a gain on sale of KAH Hospice in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. In June 2022, we classified KAH Hospice as held-for-sale and aggregated KAH Hospice’s assets and liabilities separately on the balance sheet.

Prior to the KAH Hospice disposition on August 11, 2022, KAH Hospice pretax earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were $24 million and $150 million, respectively.  \nOn August 17, 2021, we acquired the remaining 60% interest in Kindred at Home, or KAH, the nation’s largest home health and hospice provider, from TPG Capital, or TPG, and Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, or WCAS, two private equity funds for an enterprise value of $8.2 billion, which included our equity value of $2.4 billion associated with our 40% minority ownership interest. We paid the approximate $5.8 billion transaction price (net of our existing equity stake) through a combination of debt financing, the assumption of existing KAH indebtedness and parent company cash.  \nDuring 2022 and 2021, we acquired various health and wellness related businesses which, individually or in the aggregate, have not had a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. The results of operations and financial condition of these businesses acquired in 2022 and 2021 have been included in our condensed consolidated statements of income and condensed consolidated balance sheets from the respective acquisition dates.

The complaints in both lawsuits allege, among other things, that GE, as the Company’s controlling stockholder, and the members of the Company’s Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties by entering into the 2018 Transactions.  The relief sought in the complaints includes a request for a declaration that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties, that GE was unjustly enriched, disgorgement of profits, an award of damages sustained by the Company, pre- and post-judgment interest, and attorneys’ fees and costs.  On March 21, 2019, the Chancery Court entered an order consolidating the Schippnick and City of Riviera Beach complaints under consolidated C.A. No. 2019-0201-AGB, styled in re Baker Hughes, a GE company derivative litigation. On May 10, 2019, Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims against the members of the Company’s Conflicts Committee, and on May 15, 2019, Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims against former Baker Hughes director Martin Craighead. On June 7, 2019, the defendants and nominal defendant filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on the ground that the derivative plaintiffs failed to make a demand on the Company’s Board of Directors to pursue the claims itself, and GE and the Company’s Board of Directors filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on the ground that the complaint failed to state a claim on which relief can be granted. The Chancery Court denied the motions on October 8, 2019, except granted GE’s motion to dismiss the unjust enrichment claim against it. On October 31, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors designated a Special Litigation Committee and empowered it with full authority to investigate and evaluate the allegations and issues raised in the derivative litigation. The Special Litigation Committee filed a motion to stay the derivative litigation during its investigation. On December 3, 2019, the Chancery Court granted the motion and stayed the derivative litigation until June 1, 2020. On May 20, 2020, the Chancery Court granted an extension of the stay to October 1, 2020, and on September 29, 2020, the Court granted a further extension of the stay to October 15, 2020.

The relief sought in these complaints include a request for a declaration that Defendants breached their fiduciary duties, an award of damages, pre- and post-judgment interest, and attorneys’ fees and costs. The lawsuits have been consolidated, and plaintiffs filed a consolidated class action complaint on December 17, 2019 against certain former BHI officers alleging breaches of fiduciary duty and against GE for aiding and abetting those breaches. The December 2019 complaint omitted the former members of the Board of Directors of BHI, except for Mr. Craighead who also served as President and CEO of BHI. Mr. Craighead and Ms. Ross, who served as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of BHI, remain named in the December 2019 complaint along with GE.

On or around February 12, 2020, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the lawsuit on the grounds that the complaint failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted. On or around October 27, 2020, the Chancery Court granted GE’s motion to dismiss, and granted in part the motion to dismiss filed by Mr. Craighead and Ms. Ross, thereby dismissing all of the claims against GE and Ms. Ross, and all but one of the claims against Mr. Craighead.

As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, Exelon Corporate had $319 million and $324 million, respectively, recorded to intercompany notes receivable from Generation. In connection with the separation, on January 31, 2022, Exelon Corporate received cash from Generation of $258 million to settle the intercompany loan.Debt CovenantsAs of December 31, 2021, the Registrants are in compliance with debt covenants.Nonrecourse Debt Exelon, through Generation, has issued nonrecourse debt financing, in which approximately $2 billion of generating assets have been pledged as collateral as of December 31, 2021. Borrowings under these agreements are secured by the assets and equity of each respective project. The lenders do not have recourse against Exelon in the event of a default. If a specific project financing entity does not maintain compliance with its specific nonrecourse debt financing covenants, there could be a requirement to accelerate repayment of the associated debt or other borrowings earlier than the stated maturity dates. In these instances, if such repayment was not satisfied, the lenders or security holders would generally have rights to foreclose against the project-specific assets and related collateral. The potential requirement to satisfy its associated debt or other borrowings earlier than otherwise anticipated could lead to impairments due to a higher likelihood of disposing of the respective project-specific assets significantly before the end of their useful lives.Antelope Valley Solar Ranch One. In December 2011, the DOE Loan Programs Office issued a guarantee for up to $646 million for a nonrecourse loan from the Federal Financing Bank to support the financing of the construction of the Antelope Valley facility.

Interest rates on the loan were fixed upon each advance at a spread of 37.5 basis points above U.S. Treasuries of comparable maturity. The advances were completed as of December 31, 2015 and the outstanding loan balance will bear interest at an average blended interest rate of 2.82%. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, approximately $435 million and $460 million were outstanding, respectively. In addition, letters of credit were issued to support Generation's equity investment in the project with $37 million outstanding as of December 31, 2021.

There is no expiration date for the repurchase program, and the timing and amount of repurchases under the program are determined by the Company's management based on market conditions and other factors. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time by the Board of Directors.Mandatory Convertible Preferred StockOn June 29, 2018, we issued 1,380,000 shares of 5.0% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A (“MCPS”) with a par value of $0.01 per share and liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, which included the exercise of an over-allotment option in full to purchase 180,000 shares. We received net $1.34 billion in proceeds from the issuance of the MCPS, excluding $43 million of issuance costs.

{"question": "ALJ Recommended Disallowance", "answer": "8", "task": "SEC-NUM", "context": "\n  \n  \nETT Rate Matters (Applies to AEP)  \nETT Interim Transmission Rates  \nAEP has a 50% equity ownership interest in ETT. Predominantly all of ETT’s revenues are based on interim rate changes that can be filed twice annually and are subject to review and possible true-up in the next base rate proceeding. Through June 30, 2022, AEP’s share of ETT’s cumulative revenues that are subject to review is approximately $1.4 billion. A base rate review could produce a refund if ETT incurs a disallowance of the transmission investment on which an interim increase was based. A revenue decrease, including a refund of interim transmission rates, could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses, if any, that are reasonably possible of occurring. ETT is required to file for a comprehensive rate review no later than February 1, 2023, during which the $1.4 billion of cumulative revenues above will be subject to review.  \nI&M Rate Matters (Applies to AEP and I&M)  \nMichigan Power Supply Cost Recovery (PSCR) Reconciliation  \nIn April 2022, an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) issued a Proposal for Decision (PFD) for I&M’s PSCR reconciliation for the 12-month period ending December 31, 2020, recommending the MPSC disallow approximately $8 million of purchased power costs that I&M incurred under the Inter-Company Power Agreement with OVEC and the Unit Power Agreement with AEGCo. In May 2022, I&M submitted exceptions to the ALJ’s PFD related to the recommended disallowance of purchased power costs described above. I&M anticipates that the MPSC will issue a final decision in the second half of 2022. Management is unable to predict the impact, if any, that the MPSC’s final decision may have on future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.   \nIndiana Earnings Test Filings  \nI&M is required by Indiana law to submit an earnings test evaluation for the most recent one-year and five-year periods as part of I&M’s semi-annual Indiana FAC filings. These earnings test evaluations require I&M to include a credit in the FAC factor computation for periods in which I&M earned above its authorized return for both the one-year and five-year periods. The credit is determined as 50% of the lower of the one-year or five-year earnings above the authorized level. In the third quarter of 2022, I&M will submit its FAC filing and earnings test evaluation for the period ended May 2022. As of June 30, 2022, I&M’s financial statements adequately reflect the estimated impact of I&M’s upcoming Indiana earnings test filings. If it is determined that I&M’s over-earnings exceed what has been recorded, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.  \n2022 Michigan Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) Filing  \nIn February 2022, I&M filed a request with the MPSC for approval of its 2022 IRP. Included in that filing were requests for approval and deferral of costs associated with resources commencing construction within three years of the Commission’s order in the filing. These resources include the new generation resources expected to be in-service by 2028, and demand-side resources, including load management programs and conservation voltage reduction investments. I&M is also requesting MPSC approval of I&M’s Rockport Unit 2 transition plan consistent with that approved by the IURC, including certain cost recovery related to remaining net book value of investments made during the term of the Rockport Unit 2 lease and future use of Rockport Unit 2 as a capacity resource. In addition, I&M has made requests for approval of a financial incentive on certain power purchase agreements and load management programs.   \nIn June 2022, intervening parties recommended various adjustments to I&M’s proposals, including the process I&M would use to receive approval of new generation resources, changes to or denial of requested financial incentives and requests for deferral and pre-approval of costs. Specific to I&M’s Rockport Unit 2 transition plan, certain intervening parties recommended that the MPSC order I&M to credit back to Michigan ratepayers the jurisdictional 161\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

The sales agreement provides that, in addition to the issuance and sale of shares of Entergy common stock, Entergy may enter into forward sale agreements for the sale of its common stock. The aggregate number of shares of common stock sold under this sales agreement and under any forward sale agreement may not exceed an aggregate gross sales price of $1 billion.   \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, Entergy Corporation issued 1,930,330 shares of common stock under the at the market equity distribution program. The net sales proceeds from these shares totaled $200.8 million, which includes the gross sales price of $204.2 million received by Entergy Corporation less $1.4 million of general issuance costs and $2.0 million of aggregate compensation to the agents with respect to such sales.   \nIn June, August, and October 2021, Entergy entered into forward sale agreements for 416,853 shares, 1,692,555 shares, and 250,743 shares of common stock, respectively. No amounts have or will be recorded on Entergy’s balance sheet with respect to the equity offering until settlements of the equity forward sale agreements occur. The forward sale agreements require Entergy to, at its election prior to September 30, 2022, either (i) physically settle the transactions by issuing the total of 416,853 shares, 1,692,555 shares, and 250,743 shares, respectively, of its common stock to the forward counterparties in exchange for net proceeds at the then-applicable forward sale price specified by the agreements (initially approximately $106.87, $111.16, and $100.35 per share, respectively) or (ii) net settle the transactions in whole or in part through the delivery or receipt of cash or shares. The forward sale price is subject to adjustment on a daily basis based on a floating interest rate factor and will decrease by other fixed amounts specified in the agreements. In connection with the forward sale agreements, the forward seller, or its affiliates, borrowed from third parties and sold 416,853 shares, 1,692,555 shares, and 250,743 shares, respectively, of Entergy Corporation’s common stock. The gross sales price of these shares totaled $45 million, $190.1 million, and $25.4 million, respectively. In connection with the sales of these shares, Entergy paid to the agents fees of $0.5 million, $1.9 million, and $0.3 million, respectively, which have not been deducted from the gross sales prices. Entergy did not receive any proceeds from such sales of borrowed shares.  \nUntil settlement of the forward sale agreements, earnings per share dilution resulting from the agreements, if any, will be determined under the treasury stock method. Share dilution occurs when the average market price of Entergy’s common stock is higher than the average forward sales price. At December 31, 2021, 1,158,917 shares under the forward sale agreements were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their effect would have been antidilutive.  \nEquity Forward Sale Agreements  \nIn June 2018, Entergy marketed an equity offering of 15.3 million shares of common stock. In lieu of issuing equity at the time of the offering, Entergy entered into forward sale agreements with various investment banks. The equity forwards required Entergy to, at its election prior to June 7, 2019, either (i) physically settle the transactions by issuing the total of 15.3 million shares of its common stock to the investment banks in exchange for net proceeds at the then-applicable forward sale price specified by the agreements (initially $74.45 per share) or (ii) net settle the transactions in whole or in part through the delivery or receipt of cash or shares. The forward sale price was subject to adjustment on a daily basis based on a floating interest rate factor and decreased by other fixed amounts specified in the agreements.   \nIn December 2018, Entergy physically settled a portion of its obligations under the forward sale agreements by delivering 6,834,221 shares of common stock in exchange for cash proceeds of $500 million. The forward sale price used to determine the cash proceeds received by Entergy was calculated based on the initial forward sale price 140\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

KDG, which is headquartered in Bloomfield, Connecticut, is a power transmission, automation and fluid power industrial distributor and solutions provider with operations throughout the United States, providing electro-mechanical products, bearings, power transmission, motion control and electrical and fluid power components to MRO and OEM customers. KDG has approximately 1,700 employees with approximately 220 locations across the United States and Puerto Rico. As of January 3, 2022, KDG had estimated annual revenues of approximately $1 billion.The net cash consideration transferred of approximately $1.3 billion is net of the estimated cash acquired of approximately $30 million. The KDG acquisition was financed using a combination of borrowings under the existing unsecured revolving credit facility, proceeds of $200 million from the selling of additional receivables under our amended A/R Sales Agreement and $109 million of cash. The following table summarizes the preliminary, estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as adjustments made to the acquisition accounting during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 (referred to as the \"measurement period adjustments\"). The measurement period adjustments primarily resulted from revisions to the valuation of certain tangible and intangible assets. The fair value of the acquired identifiable intangible assets is provisional pending completion of the final valuations for these assets. We are in the process of analyzing the estimated values of all assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date, including, among other things, obtaining valuations of certain tangible and intangible assets, as well as the fair value of certain contracts and the determination of certain tax balances. Additional adjustments may be made to the acquisition accounting during the measurement period primarily related to intangible asset revaluations, tax accounting and leases.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  | As of January 3, 2022 |\n| (in thousands) |  | Initial Balance | Measurement Period Adjustments | As Adjusted |\n| Trade accounts receivable |  | $ | 156,000  |  | $ | —  |  | $ | 156,000  |  |\n| Merchandise inventories |  | 166,000  |  | (1,000) |  | 165,000  |  |\n| Prepaid expenses and other current assets |  | 39,000  |  | (2,000) |  | 37,000  |  |\n| Property, plant and equipment |  | 26,000  |  | (2,000) |  | 24,000  |  |\n| Operating lease assets |  | 49,000  |  | (5,000) |  | 44,000  |  |\n| Other assets |  | 1,000  |  | —  |  | 1,000  |  |\n| Other intangible assets |  | 574,000  |  | (6,000) |  | 568,000  |  |\n| Goodwill |  | 592,000  |  | 4,000  |  | 596,000  |  |\n| Total assets acquired |  | 1,603,000  |  | (12,000) |  | 1,591,000  |  |\n| Trade accounts payable |  | 85,000  |  | —  |  | 85,000  |  |\n| Other current liabilities |  | 32,000  |  | —  |  | 32,000  |  |\n| Operating lease liabilities |  | 17,000  |  | (1,000) |  | 16,000  |  |\n| Deferred tax liabilities |  | 121,000  |  | (10,000) |  | 111,000  |  |\n| Other long-term liabilities |  | 39,000  |  | (4,000) |  | 35,000  |  |\n| Total liabilities assumed |  | 294,000  |  | (15,000) |  | 279,000  |  |\n| Net assets acquired |  | $ | 1,309,000  |  | $ | 3,000  |  | $ | 1,312,000  |  |\n\nThe other intangible assets acquired included $527 million of customer relationship intangibles and a $41 million favorable trade name licensing agreement, with amortization lives of 17 and 1.5 years, respectively.

Variable Interest Entities Consolidated VIEsAutomotive Financing – GM Financial GM Financial uses special purpose entities (SPEs) that are considered VIEs to issue variable funding notes to third party, bank-sponsored warehouse facilities or asset-backed securities to investors in securitization transactions. The debt issued by these VIEs is backed by finance receivables and leasing-related assets transferred to the VIEs (Securitized Assets). GM Financial determined that it is the primary beneficiary of the SPEs because the servicing responsibilities for the Securitized Assets give GM Financial the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the performance of the VIEs and the variable interests in the VIEs give GM Financial the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive residual returns that could potentially be significant. The assets of the VIEs serve as the sole source of repayment for the debt issued by these entities. Investors in the notes issued by the VIEs do not have recourse to GM Financial or its other assets, with the exception of customary representation and warranty repurchase provisions and indemnities that GM Financial provides as the servicer. GM Financial is not required to provide additional financial support to these SPEs. While these subsidiaries are included in GM Financial's condensed consolidated financial statements, they are separate legal entities and the finance receivables, lease-related assets and cash held by them are legally owned by them and are not available to GM Financial's creditors or creditors of GM Financial's other subsidiaries.  \n13  \n\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

The lease agreements, inclusive of all amendments, include (i) a 15-year initial term with four five-year renewal options, (ii) annual fixed rent payments of $1.1 billion, subject to annual escalation provisions based on the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”) and a 2% floor commencing in lease year two of the initial term and (iii) a variable element based on net revenues of the underlying leased properties, commencing in lease year eight of the initial term. The Regional Lease includes a put-call option whereby the Company may require VICI to purchase and lease back (as lessor) or whereby VICI may require the Company to sell to VICI and lease back (as lessee) the real estate components of the gaming and racetrack facilities of Harrah’s Hoosier Park Racing & Casino and Indiana Grand (“Centaur properties”). Election to exercise the option by either party must be made during the election period beginning January 1, 2022 and ending December 31, 2024. Upon either party exercising their option, the Centaur properties would be sold at a price in accordance with the agreement and leased back to CEI in accordance to the pre-existing terms of the Regional Lease. The sale of Caesars Southern Indiana to EBCI for $250 million was finalized on September 3, 2021 and as a result of the sale, Caesars’ annual payments to VICI Properties under the Regional Lease decreased by $33 million and variable rent under the lease shall exclude net revenue attributable to Caesars Southern Indiana.The Golf Course Use Agreement between the Company and VICI, encompassing four golf courses in three states, has a 35-year term (inclusive of all renewal periods), whereby the Company agrees to pay (i) an annual membership fee of $11 million, subject to annual escalation provisions based on the CPI and a 2% floor (ii) annual use fees of $3 million, including escalation provisions based on the CPI and a 2% floor commencing on the second lease year through and including the final lease year and (iii) certain per-round fees, as set forth in the agreement. Furthermore, the term of the Golf Course Use Agreement was extended such that there will be 15 years remaining until the expiration of the initial term.GLPI LeasesThe fair value of the real estate assets and the related failed sale-leaseback financing obligations were estimated based on the present value of the estimated future lease payments over the lease term of 35 years, including renewal options, using an imputed discount rate of approximately 9.75%.

We believe that any losses in excess of the amounts accrued therefore as liabilities on our consolidated financial statements are unlikely to be significant, but litigation is inherently uncertain and there is the potential for a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements if one or more matters are resolved in a particular period in an amount materially in excess of what we anticipated.In January 2008, CBRE MCI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CBRE Capital Markets, entered into an agreement with Fannie Mae under Fannie Mae’s DUS Program to provide financing for multifamily housing with five or more units. Under the DUS Program, CBRE MCI originates, underwrites, closes and services loans without prior approval by Fannie Mae, and typically, is subject to sharing up to one-third of any losses on loans originated under the DUS Program. CBRE MCI has funded loans with unpaid principal balances of $35.2 billion at December 31, 2021, of which $31.2 billion is subject to such loss sharing arrangements. CBRE MCI, under its agreement with Fannie Mae, must post cash reserves or other acceptable collateral under formulas established by Fannie Mae to provide for sufficient capital in the event losses occur. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, CBRE MCI had a $100.0 million and a $95.0 million, respectively, letter of credit under this reserve arrangement and had recorded a liability of approximately $64.0 million and $57.1 million, respectively, for its loan loss guarantee obligation under such arrangement. Fannie Mae’s recourse under the DUS Program is limited to the assets of CBRE MCI, which assets totaled approximately $1.1 billion (including $611.3 million of warehouse receivables, a substantial majority of which are pledged against warehouse lines of credit and are therefore not available to Fannie Mae) at December 31, 2021.On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was enacted in the U.S. in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The CARES Act, among other things, permits borrowers with government-backed mortgages from Government Sponsored Enterprises who are experiencing a financial hardship to obtain forbearance of their loans. For Fannie Mae loans that we service, CBRE MCI is obligated to advance (for a forbearance period up to 90 consecutive days and potentially longer) scheduled principal and interest payments to Fannie Mae, regardless of whether the borrowers actually make the payments. These advances are reimbursable by Fannie Mae after 120 days. As of December 31, 2021, total advances for principal and interest were $9.3 million, all of which have already been reimbursed.CBRE Capital Markets participates in Freddie Mac’s Multifamily Small Balance Loan (SBL) Program. Under the SBL program, CBRE Capital Markets has certain repurchase and loss reimbursement obligations. We could potentially be obligated to repurchase any SBL loan originated by CBRE Capital Markets that remains in default for 120 days following the forbearance period, if the default occurred during the first 12 months after origination and such loan had not been earlier securitized. In addition, CBRE Capital Markets may be responsible for a loss not to exceed 10% of the original principal amount of any SBL loan that is not securitized and goes into default after the 12-month repurchase period. CBRE Capital Markets must post a cash reserve or other acceptable collateral to provide for sufficient capital in the event the obligations are triggered. As of both December 31, 2021 and 2020, CBRE Capital Markets had posted a $5.0 million letter of credit under this reserve arrangement.We had outstanding letters of credit totaling $159.1 million as of December 31, 2021, excluding letters of credit for which we have outstanding liabilities already accrued on our consolidated balance sheet related to our subsidiaries’ outstanding reserves for claims under certain insurance programs as well as letters of credit related to operating leases. The CBRE Capital Markets letters of credit totaling $105.0 million as of December 31, 2021 referred to in the preceding paragraphs represented the majority of the $159.1 million outstanding letters of credit as of such date. The remaining letters of credit are primarily executed by us in the ordinary course of business and expire at the end of each of the respective agreements.We had guarantees totaling $50.9 million as of December 31, 2021, excluding guarantees related to pension liabilities, consolidated indebtedness and other obligations for which we have outstanding liabilities already accrued on our consolidated balance sheet, and excluding guarantees related to operating leases. The $50.9 million primarily represents guarantees executed by us in the ordinary course of business, including various guarantees of management and vendor contracts in our operations overseas, which expire at the end of each of the respective agreements.99\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

The Prior Credit Facility provided for a senior unsecured $2.0 billion term loan facility and a senior unsecured $3.0 billion revolving credit facility. In August 2022, all borrowings outstanding and other amounts due under the Prior Credit Facility were repaid and the Prior Credit Facility was terminated.  \nBridge Facility  \nOn August 1, 2022, in connection with our entry into the EVO merger agreement, we obtained commitments for a $4.3 billion, 364-day senior unsecured bridge facility (the \"Bridge Facility\"). Upon the execution of permanent financing, including the issuance of our senior unsecured notes and entry into the Revolving Credit Facility described above, the aggregate commitments under the Bridge Facility were reduced to zero and terminated. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, we recognized expense of $17.3 million related to commitment fees associated with the Bridge Facility, which was presented within interest expense in our consolidated statement of income.  \nFair Value of Long-Term Debt  \nAs of September 30, 2022, our senior notes had a total carrying amount of $11.9 billion and an estimated fair value of $10.4 billion. The estimated fair value of our senior notes was based on quoted market prices in an active market and is considered to be a Level 1 measurement of the valuation hierarchy.   \nAs of September 30, 2022, our Convertible Notes had a total carrying amount of $1.5 billion and an estimated fair value of $1.4 billion. The estimated fair value of our Convertible Notes was based on a lattice pricing model and is considered to be a Level 3 measurement of the valuation hierarchy.  \nThe fair value of other long-term debt approximated its carrying amount at September 30, 2022.  \nCompliance with Covenants  \nThe Convertible Notes include customary covenants and events of default for convertible notes of this type. The Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants and restrictive covenants, including, among others, financial covenants based on net leverage and interest coverage ratios, and customary events of default. As of September 30, 2022, financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Agreement required a leverage ratio of 3.75 to 1.00 and an interest coverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of September 30, 2022.  \nDerivative Agreements  \nWe had previously entered into interest rate swap agreements with financial institutions to hedge changes in cash flows attributable to interest rate risk on a portion of our variable-rate debt instruments. Net amounts to be received or paid under the swap agreements were reflected as adjustments to interest expense. Since we had designated the interest rate swap agreements as portfolio cash flow hedges, unrealized gains or losses resulting from adjusting the swaps to fair value were recorded as components of other comprehensive income (loss). The fair values of our interest rate swaps were determined based on the present value of the estimated future net cash flows using implied rates in the applicable yield curve as of the valuation date. These derivative instruments were classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.   \nIn August 2022, in connection with entry into the Revolving Credit Agreement and repayment of amounts outstanding under the Prior Credit Facility, we terminated and settled our existing interest rate swap agreements. The termination resulted in the recognition of a net gain of $1.2 million, including the reclassification of $0.5 million of accumulated losses from the separate component of equity. The net gain was presented in interest expense in our consolidated statement of income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. As of December 30, 2021, accounts payable and accrued liabilities included $28.8 million related to the interest rate swaps.  \n22\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

As a result, the company believes the concentration of credit risk is limited. The company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers. When the financial strength of a customer is not considered sufficient, alternative risk mitigation measures may be deployed, including requiring prepayments, letters of credit or other acceptable forms of collateral. Once credit is extended and a receivable balance exists, the company applies a quantitative calculation to current trade receivable balances that reflects credit risk predictive analysis, including probability of default and loss given default, which takes into consideration current and forward-looking market data as well as the company’s historical loss data. This statistical approach becomes the basis of the company’s expected credit loss allowance for current trade receivables with payment terms that are typically short-term in nature, with most due in less than 90 days. Chevron’s non-trade receivable balance was $4.6 billion as of September 30, 2022, which includes receivables from certain governments in their capacity as joint venture partners. Joint venture partner balances that are paid as per contract terms or not yet due are subject to the statistical analysis described above while past due balances are subject to additional qualitative management quarterly review. This management review includes review of reasonable and supportable repayment forecasts. Non-trade receivables also include employee and tax receivables that are deemed immaterial and low risk. Equity affiliate loans are also considered non-trade and associated allowances of $560 million are included within Investments and Advances on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at both September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021. Note 17. Acquisition of Renewable Energy Group, Inc.On June 13, 2022, the company acquired Renewable Energy Group, Inc. (REG), an independent company focused on converting natural fats, oils and greases into advanced biofuels. REG utilizes a global integrated production, procurement, distribution and logistics network to operate 11 biorefineries in the U.S. and Europe. Ten biorefineries produce biodiesel and one produces renewable diesel. The acquisition combines REG’s growing renewable fuels production and leading feedstock capabilities with Chevron’s large manufacturing, distribution and commercial marketing position. Chevron acquired outstanding shares of REG in an all-cash transaction valued at $3.15 billion, or $61.50 per share. As part of the transaction, the company recognized long-term debt and finance leases with a fair value of $590 million.The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under ASC 805, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. Provisional fair value measurements were made for acquired assets and liabilities, and adjustments to those measurements may be made in subsequent periods, up to one year from the acquisition date, as information necessary to complete the analysis is obtained. Tangible and intangible assets were valued using a combination of replacement cost approach and discounted cash flows that incorporated internally generated price assumptions and production profiles together with appropriate operating and capital cost assumptions. Debt assumed in the acquisition was valued based on observable market prices for REG’s debt. As a result of measuring the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at fair value, the company recognized $293 million of goodwill.21\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

Share-based compensation  \nThe Chubb Limited 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the Amended 2016 LTIP), permits grants of both incentive and non-qualified stock options principally at an option price per share equal to the grant date fair value of Chubb's Common Shares. Stock options are generally granted with a 3-year vesting period and a 10-year term. Stock options typically vest in equal annual installments over the respective vesting period, which is also the requisite service period. On February 24, 2022, Chubb granted 1,699,554 stock options with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $35.21 each. The fair value of the options issued is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.  \nThe Amended 2016 LTIP also permits grants of service-based restricted stock and restricted stock units as well as performance-based restricted stock awards. Chubb generally grants service-based restricted stock and restricted stock units with a 4-year vesting period, based on a graded vesting schedule. The performance-based restricted stock awards granted comprise target awards and premium awards that cliff vest at the end of a 3-year performance period based on both tangible book value (shareholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets, net of tax) per share growth and P&C combined ratio compared to a defined group of peer companies. Premium awards are subject to an additional vesting provision based on total shareholder return compared to our peer group. The restricted stock is principally granted at market close price on the grant date. On February 24, 2022, Chubb granted 807,194 service-based restricted stock awards, 295,301 service-based restricted stock units, and 294,229 performance-based stock awards to employees and officers with a grant date fair value of $199.03 each.

Asset Retirement Obligations (All Registrants)Nuclear Decommissioning Asset Retirement Obligations (Exelon)Generation has a legal obligation to decommission its nuclear power plants following permanent cessation of operations. To estimate its decommissioning obligations related to its nuclear generating stations for financial accounting and reporting purposes, Generation uses a probability-weighted, discounted cash flow model which, on a unit-by-unit basis, considers multiple outcome scenarios that include significant estimates and assumptions, and are based on decommissioning cost studies, cost escalation rates, probabilistic cash flow models, and discount rates. Generation updates its AROs annually, unless circumstances warrant more frequent updates, based on its review of updated cost studies and its annual evaluation of cost escalation factors and probabilities assigned to various scenarios. Generation began decommissioning the TMI nuclear plant upon permanently ceasing operations in 2019. See below section for decommissioning of Zion Station.The financial statement impact for changes in the ARO, on an individual unit basis, due to the changes in and timing of estimated cash flows generally result in a corresponding change in the unit’s ARC in Property, plant, and equipment in Exelon’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the ARO decreases for a Non-Regulatory Agreement unit without any remaining ARC, the corresponding change is recorded as a decrease in Operating and maintenance expense in Exelon’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.The following table provides a rollforward of the nuclear decommissioning AROs reflected in Exelon’s Consolidated Balance Sheets from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2021:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Nuclear decommissioning AROs as of December 31, 2019 | $ | 10,504  |  |\n| Net increase due to changes in, and timing of, estimated future cash flows | 1,022  |  |\n| Accretion expense | 489  |  |\n| Costs incurred related to decommissioning plants | (93) |  |\n| Nuclear decommissioning AROs as of December 31, 2020(a) | 11,922  |  |\n| Net increase due to changes in, and timing of, estimated future cash flows | 324  |  |\n| Accretion expense | 503  |  |\n| Costs incurred related to decommissioning plants | (73) |  |\n| Nuclear decommissioning AROs as of December 31, 2021(a)  | $ | 12,676  |  |\n|  |  |\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_(a)Includes $72 million and $80 million as the current portion of the ARO as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which is included in Other current liabilities in Exelon’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.The net $324 million increase in the ARO during 2021 for changes in the amounts and timing of estimated decommissioning cash flows was driven by multiple adjustments throughout the year. These adjustments primarily include:•An increase of approximately $550 million for updated cost escalation rates, primarily for labor and energy, and a decrease in discount rates.•An increase of approximately $90 million due to revisions to assumed retirement dates for several nuclear plants.•A net decrease of approximately $170 million was driven by updates to Byron and Dresden reflecting changes in assumed retirement dates and assumed methods of decommissioning as a result of the reversal of the decision to early retire the plants.

If these performance-based milestones are not met but service conditions are met, the performance-based restricted stock units will not vest, in which case any compensation expense we have recognized to date will be reversed. Generally, the measurement periods of our performance-based restricted stock units are 3 to 4 years, with awards vesting after each annual measurement period or cliff-vesting after the completion of the total aggregate measurement period.Each quarter, we update our assessment of the probability that the performance milestones will be achieved. We amortize the fair values of performance-based restricted stock units over the requisite service period. The performance-based restricted stock units contain threshold, target and maximum milestones for each performance-based milestone. The number of shares of common stock to be issued at vesting will range from zero to 200 percent of the target number of performance-based restricted stock units attributable to each performance-based milestone based on the company’s performance as compared to these threshold, target and maximum performance-based milestones. Each performance-based milestone is weighted evenly and the number of shares that vest based on each performance-based milestone is independent from the other.21  \n\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

{"question": "Loss contingency agreed payment", "answer": "8", "task": "SEC-NUM", "context": "\n  \nbecause (in the view of the Second Circuit) the exchanges were not carrying out regulatory functions while operating their markets and engaging in the challenged conduct at issue, and that the plaintiffs had adequately pleaded claims against the defendants under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act. The Second Circuit directed that, on remand, the district court should address and rule upon various other defenses raised by the exchanges in their motion to dismiss (which the district court did not address in its prior opinion and order). In 2019, the district court denied a new motion to dismiss filed by the defendants, and the exchanges filed answers to the complaint, denying the principal allegations of the plaintiffs, denying liability in the matter, and asserting various affirmative defenses. During 2021, the parties conducted discovery, relating largely to class certification issues; the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification; and the defendants filed motions for summary judgment on the basis of preclusion and lack of standing. The parties are awaiting decisions from the court. LIBOR LitigationIn 2019, three virtually identical purported class action complaints were filed in the Southern District against ICE and several of its subsidiaries, including ICE Benchmark Administration Limited, or IBA, collectively referred to as the ICE Defendants, as well as 18 multinational banks and various of their respective subsidiaries and affiliates, or the Panel Bank Defendants, by, respectively, Putnam Bank, a savings bank based in Putnam, Connecticut; two municipal pension funds affiliated with the City of Livonia, Michigan; and four retirement and benefit funds affiliated with the Hawaii Sheet Metal Workers Union. IBA is the administrator for various regulated benchmarks, including the ICE LIBOR benchmark that is calculated daily based upon the submissions from a reference panel (which includes the Panel Bank Defendants).The plaintiffs sought to litigate on behalf of a purported class of all U.S.-based persons or entities who transacted with a Panel Bank Defendant by receiving a payment on an interest rate indexed to a one-month or three-month USD LIBOR-benchmarked rate during the period from February 1, 2014 to the present. The plaintiffs alleged that the ICE Defendants and the Panel Bank Defendants engaged in a conspiracy to set the LIBOR benchmark at artificially low levels, with an alleged purpose and effect of depressing payments by the Panel Bank Defendants to members of the purported class.  Subsequent to the filing of the individual complaints, the various plaintiffs referenced above filed a consolidated amended complaint against the ICE Defendants and the Panel Bank Defendants. As with the individual complaints, the consolidated amended complaint asserted a claim for violations of the Sherman and Clayton Antitrust Acts and sought unspecified treble damages and other relief. The ICE Defendants and the Panel Bank Defendants filed motions to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint.On March 26, 2020, the court issued a decision and order granting the ICE Defendants and the Panel Bank Defendants' motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Among other things, the court found that the amended complaint “…is made up of almost entirely conclusory allegations and is essentially devoid of any evidence, direct or circumstantial, to support the conclusion that Defendants colluded with one another.” The plaintiffs appealed the decision to the Second Circuit. While briefing of the appeal was ongoing, each of the named plaintiffs withdrew from the case. DYJ Holdings, LLC, a New Jersey-based holding company, was permitted, over the objection of the defendants, to intervene for the purpose of serving as named plaintiff and representative of the purported class. On November 29, 2021, the Second Circuit heard oral argument on the merits of the underlying appeal, and the parties are awaiting a decision.ICE Data Pricing & Reference Data MatterOur subsidiary ICE Data Pricing & Reference Data, LLC, or PRD, is a registered investment advisor in the business of, among other things, providing clients with evaluated pricing and other information for fixed-income securities. PRD formerly had a business practice of passing through third-party price quotes, or broker quotes, in certain fixed income securities as-is to its clients when PRD did not believe it had the capability to model an evaluated price for such securities. Broker quoted securities were less than 2% of the securities PRD priced. A list of securities that were broker quoted, as distinguished from evaluated, was made available to PRD’s clients every day. PRD first notified its clients on December 16, 2019 that it would cease providing broker quotes and did so as of October 1, 2020. On December 9, 2020, following an SEC investigation of PRD’s legacy business practices with respect to broker quotes, the SEC announced a settlement in which PRD, without admitting or denying the findings therein, agreed to pay an $8 million civil monetary penalty, together with certain non-monetary provisions. For further details about the settlement and underlying matter under investigation, please refer to Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Pursuant to Sections 203(e) and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order, Administrative Proceeding File No. 3-20164 (In the Matter of ICE Data Pricing & Reference Data, LLC).Separately, PRD’s legacy business practices with respect to broker quotes received from a now-bankrupt entity named Live Well Financial, Inc., or Live Well, are relevant to potential civil claims against PRD.

The initial fair value estimate as of November 1 , 2021 was based on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market value approach, Level 3 inputs. The unobservable inputs used in the discounted cash flows model included projected EBITDA margin growth rates of approximately 24%, a long term growth rate of 2.5%, and a weighted average cost of capital of 9%. Our significant estimates in the market approach model included identifying similar companies with comparable business factors that could be reasonably considered investment alternatives and assessing comparable valuation multiples while applying a control premium in estimating the fair value of the investment. The unobservable inputs to the market approach included a revenue multiple of 3.5x and a control premium of 20%. Significant increases or decreases in the inputs to the discounted cash flow or market value approach would result in a significant higher or lower fair value measurements. As of December 31, 2021, we concluded that there was no change in valuation.Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring BasisOur non-financial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets and property and equipment, as well as equity method investments, are adjusted to fair value when an impairment charge is recognized or the underlying investment is sold. Such fair value measurements are based predominately on Level 3 inputs. We measure our minority investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment, adjusted by observable price changes with changes recorded within other, net on our consolidated statements of operations.Goodwill. During 2021, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $14 million in our B2B segment resulting from valuing a component of our Egencia reporting unit that remained after the sale on November 1, 2021. During 2020, due to the severe and persistent negative effect COVID-19 had on global economies, the travel industry and our business, as well as the uncertainty and high variability in anticipated versus actual rates of recovery, in addition to our annual assessment on October 1, 2020, we deemed it necessary to perform various interim assessments of goodwill. As a result of assessments during 2020, we recognized goodwill impairment charges of $799 million, of which $559 million related to our Retail segment, primarily our Vrbo reporting unit, and $240 million related to our trivago segment. Our assessments compared the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying value. The fair value estimates for all reporting units, except trivago, were based on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market value approach, Level 3 inputs. The significant estimates used in the discounted cash flows model included our weighted average cost of capital, projected cash flows and the long-term rate of growth. Our assumptions were based on the actual historical performance of the reporting unit and took into account operating result trends, the anticipated duration of COVID-19 impacts and rates of recovery, and implied risk premiums based on market prices of our equity and debt as of the assessment dates. Our significant estimates in the market approach model included identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and earnings multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair value estimate for the trivago reporting unit was based on trivago’s stock price, a Level 1 input, adjusted for an estimated control premium. The excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over our estimate of the fair value was recorded as goodwill impairment charges during 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the applicable reporting units within our Retail segment had $2.3 billion goodwill remaining after the impairments incurred in 2020 and our trivago segment had $337 million goodwill remaining. Intangible and Long-term Assets.

The Company also enters into exchange traded derivative commodity instruments that are generally settled with offsetting positions. Settlements of derivative commodity instruments are reported as a component of cash flows from operating activities in the Statements of Condensed Consolidated Cash Flows.  \nWith respect to the derivative commodity instruments held by the Company, the Company hedged portions of its expected sales of production and portions of its basis exposure covering approximately 1,587 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas and 1,517 thousand barrels (Mbbl) of NGLs as of September 30, 2022 and 2,184 Bcf of natural gas and 3,055 Mbbl of NGLs as of December 31, 2021. The open positions at both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 had maturities extending through December 2027.  \nCertain of the Company's OTC derivative instrument contracts provide that, if the Company's credit rating assigned by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (Moody's), S&P Global Ratings (S&P) or Fitch Ratings Service (Fitch) is below the agreed-upon credit rating threshold (typically, below investment grade) and if the associated derivative liability exceeds the agreed-upon dollar threshold for such credit rating, the counterparty to such contract can require the Company to deposit collateral. Similarly, if such counterparty's credit rating assigned by Moody's, S&P or Fitch is below the agreed-upon credit rating threshold and if the associated derivative liability exceeds the agreed-upon dollar threshold for such credit rating, the Company can require the counterparty to deposit collateral with the Company. Such collateral can be up to 100% of the derivative liability. Investment grade refers to the quality of a company's credit as assessed by one or more credit rating agencies. To be considered investment grade, a company must be rated \"Baa3\" or higher by Moody's, \"BBB–\" or higher by S&P and \"BBB–\" or higher by Fitch. Anything below these ratings is considered non-investment grade. As of September 30, 2022, the Company's senior notes were rated \"Ba1\" by Moody's, \"BBB–\" by S&P and \"BBB–\" by Fitch.  \nWhen the net fair value of any of the Company's OTC derivative instrument contracts represents a liability to the Company that is in excess of the agreed-upon dollar threshold for the Company's then-applicable credit rating, the counterparty has the right to require the Company to remit funds as a margin deposit in an amount equal to the portion of the derivative liability that is in excess of the dollar threshold amount. The Company records these deposits as a current asset in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the aggregate fair value of all OTC derivative instruments with credit rating risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position was $679.5 million and $594.9 million, respectively, for which the Company deposited and recorded current assets of $142.7 million and $0.1 million, respectively.  \nWhen the net fair value of any of the Company's OTC derivative instrument contracts represents an asset to the Company that is in excess of the agreed-upon dollar threshold for the counterparty's then-applicable credit rating, the Company has the right to require the counterparty to remit funds as a margin deposit in an amount equal to the portion of the derivative asset that is in excess of the dollar threshold amount.

These contracts, with gross notional amounts totaling $7.9 billion at September 30, 2022 and $8.6 billion at December 31, 2021, are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates and are recorded at fair value. Accumulated gains and losses as of September 30, 2022 will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally through the next twelve to eighteen months.  \nAbbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage currency exposures for foreign currency denominated third-party trade payables and receivables, and for intercompany loans and trade accounts payable where the receivable or payable is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. For intercompany loans, the contracts require Abbott to sell or buy foreign currencies, primarily European currencies, in exchange for primarily U.S. dollars and other European currencies. For intercompany and trade payables and receivables, the currency exposures are primarily the U.S. dollar and European currencies. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, Abbott held the gross notional amounts of $10.3 billion and $12.2 billion, respectively, of such foreign currency forward exchange contracts.  \nAbbott has designated a yen-denominated, 5-year term loan of approximately $413 million and $521 million as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, as a hedge of the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The change in the value of the debt, which is due to changes in foreign exchange rates, is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.  \nAbbott is a party to interest rate hedge contracts with notional values totaling approximately $2.9 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt. These contracts are designated as fair value hedges of the variability of the fair value of fixed-rate debt due to changes in the long-term benchmark interest rates. The effect of the hedge is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a variable rate for that portion of the debt. Abbott records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount.15\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

Our commercial paper program is backed by unused commitments under our revolving credit facility under our 2020 Credit Agreement. Accordingly, outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program reduce the amount available under our revolving credit facility. As of February 28, 2021, we had no outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program.

As a result of these hedges, we fixed our interest rates on $375.0 million of our floating LIBOR rate debt at an average rate of 1.9% (exclusive of borrowing margins) from July 1, 2019, through July 1, 2020.  \nSwap lock and treasury lock contractsIn February 2022, we entered into a swap lock agreement, which was designated as a cash flow hedge. As a result, we have hedged the treasury rate volatility on $100.0 million of future debt issuances.  \nIn February and March 2020, we entered into treasury lock agreements, which were designated as cash flow hedges. As a result of these hedges, we fixed our 10-year treasury rates on $500.0 million of future debt issuances at an average rate of 1.2% (exclusive of borrowing margins). In April 2020, prior to the issuance of the 2.875% Senior Notes and 3.75% Senior Notes, we settled all outstanding treasury lock contracts, and recognized an unrealized loss, net of income tax effect, of $21.8 million in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within our consolidated balance sheets.

With respect to each of the 2023 and 2028 CHF Bonds, at any time after 85% or more of the applicable bonds have been redeemed or purchased and canceled, the Company may redeem some or all of the remaining bonds for their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. With respect to the 2021 (prior to their repayment in the first quarter of 2021), 2027 and 2032 Yen Notes; Floating Rate 2022, 2024, 2025 (prior to their repayment in the fourth quarter of 2021), 2026, 2027 and 2030 Euronotes; the 2023 and 2028 CHF Bonds; and the 2026, 2028, 2031, 2039 and 2049 Biopharma Euronotes, the Company may redeem such notes and bonds upon the occurrence of specified, adverse changes in tax laws, or interpretations under such laws, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the bonds to be redeemed.If a change of control triggering event occurs with respect to any of the 2021 (prior to their repayment in the first quarter of 2021), 2027 and 2032 Yen Notes; the 2022, Floating Rate 2022, 2024, 2025 (prior to their repayment in the fourth quarter of 2021), 2026, 2027 and 2030 Euronotes; the 2025, 2045, 2050 and 2051 U.S. Notes; the 2023 and 2028 CHF Bonds; the 2022, 2024, 2029, 2039 and 2049 Biopharma Notes; or the 2026, 2028, 2031, 2039 and 2049 Biopharma Euronotes, each holder of such notes may require the Company to repurchase some or all of such notes and bonds at a purchase price equal to 101% (100% in the case of the 2027 and 2032 Yen Notes) of the principal amount of the notes and bonds, plus accrued and unpaid interest (and in the case of the Yen Notes, certain swap-related losses as applicable). A change of control triggering event means the occurrence of both a change of control and a rating event, each as defined in the applicable indenture or comparable governing document. Except in connection with a change of control triggering event, the Company does not have any credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of outstanding debt. Each holder of the 2027 and 2032 Yen Notes may also require the Company to repurchase some or all of its notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and certain swap-related losses as applicable, in certain circumstances whereby such holder comes into violation of economic sanctions laws as a result of holding such notes.The respective indentures or comparable governing documents under which the above-described notes and bonds were issued contain customary covenants including, for example, limits on the incurrence of secured debt and sale-leaseback transactions. None of these covenants are considered restrictive to the Company’s operations and as of December 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants.LYONsIn 2001, the Company issued $830 million (value at maturity) in LYONs.

The Company’s deferred tax liability of $10 million associated with the book and tax basis difference in the converted LYONs was transferred to additional paid-in capital.

The Timber Notes were used as collateral for borrowings from third party lenders, which effectively monetized the Timber Notes through the creation of newly formed special purposes entities (the \"Entities\"). The monetization structure preserved the tax deferral that resulted from the 2006 forestlands sales. During 2015, International Paper initiated a series of actions in order to extend the 2006 monetization structure and maintain the long-term nature of the deferred tax liability. The Entities, with assets and liabilities primarily consisting of the Timber Notes and third-party bank loans (the \"Extension Loans\"), were restructured which resulted in the formation of wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote special purpose entities (the \"2015 Financing Entities\").  \nIn August 2021, the Timber Notes of $4.8 billion and the Extension Loans of $4.2 billion related to the 2015 Financing Entities both matured. We settled the Extension Loans at their maturity with the proceeds from the Timber Notes. This resulted in cash proceeds of approximately $630 million representing our equity in the variable interest entities. Maturity of the installment notes and termination of the monetization structure also resulted in a $72 million tax liability that was paid in the fourth quarter of 2021. As of December 31, 2021, the remaining deferred tax liability was $813 million. The 2015 timber monetization restructuring is currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service. An unfavorable resolution in such current examination, future administrative procedures, or future tax litigation could result in material, accelerated cash tax payments as a result of all or a portion of deferred tax liability becoming payable.Activity between the Company and the 2015 Financing Entities was as follows:   \n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| In millions | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n| Revenue (a) | $ | 61  |  | $ | 95  |  | $ | 95  |  |\n| Expense (a) | 34  |  | 122  |  | 128  |  |\n| Cash receipts (b) | 95  |  | 95  |  | 95  |  |\n| Cash payments (c) | 38  |  | 157  |  | 128  |  |\n\n  \n(a)The revenue and expense are included in Interest expense, net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.(b)The cash receipts are interest received on the Financial assets of variable interest entities.(c)The cash payments represent interest paid on Current nonrecourse financial liabilities of variable interest entities.  \nIn connection with the acquisition of Temple-Inland in February 2012, two special purpose entities became wholly-owned subsidiaries of International Paper. The use of the two wholly-owned special purpose entities discussed below preserved the tax deferral that resulted from the 2007 Temple-Inland timberlands sales. As of December 31, 2021, this deferred tax liability was $487 million, which will be settled with the maturity of the notes in 2027.  \nIn October 2007, Temple-Inland sold 1.55 million acres of timberland for $2.4 billion. The total consideration consisted almost entirely of notes due in 2027 issued by the buyer of the timberland, which Temple-Inland contributed to two wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote special purpose entities. The notes are shown in Long-term financial assets of variable interest entities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and are supported by $2.4 billion of irrevocable letters of credit issued by three banks, which are required to maintain minimum credit ratings on their long-term debt.   \nIn December 2007, Temple-Inland's two wholly-owned special purpose entities borrowed $2.1 billion which is shown in Long-term nonrecourse financial liabilities of variable interest entities. The loans are repayable in 2027 and are secured by the $2.4 billion of notes and the irrevocable letters of credit securing the notes, and are nonrecourse to us. The loan agreements provide that if a credit rating of any of the banks issuing the letters of credit is downgraded below the specified threshold, the letters of credit issued by that bank must be replaced within 30 days with letters of credit from another qualifying financial institution.74\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}
{"question": "Premium Receivable, Allowance for Credit Loss, Property Casualty Premiums Receivable", "answer": "9", "task": "SEC-NUM", "context": "\n  \napproximately 0.6% of our total property casualty earned premiums in 2021. No aggregate agency relationship locations under a single ownership structure accounted for more than 5% of our total property casualty earned premiums in 2021. We record revenues for installment charges as fee revenues in the consolidated statements of income.  Property casualty written premiums are deferred and recorded as earned premiums primarily on a pro rata basis over the terms of the policies. We record as unearned premiums the portion of written premiums that applies to unexpired policy terms. Expenses associated with successfully acquiring insurance policies – commissions, premium taxes and underwriting costs – are deferred and amortized over the terms of the policies. We assess recoverability of deferred acquisition costs at a level consistent with the way we acquire, service and manage insurance policies and measure profitability. We analyze our acquisition cost assumptions to reflect actual experience, and we evaluate potential premium deficiencies.  \nCertain property casualty policies are not entered into policy underwriting systems as of the effective date of coverage. An estimate is recorded for these unprocessed written premiums. A large majority of the estimate is unearned and has no material impact on earned premiums.  \nAn allowance for credit losses on uncollectible property casualty premiums is updated and reviewed on a quarterly basis. The allowance for credit losses was $14 million, $19 million and $9 million at December 31, 2021, 2020 and January 1, 2020 (date of adoption), respectively. A significant portion of the increase in the allowance to $19 million at December 31, 2020 was due to consideration of pandemic-related factors. Other changes in the amount for each period were immaterial. We establish reserves to cover the expected cost of claims, losses and expenses related to investigating, processing and resolving claims. Although the appropriate amount of reserves is inherently uncertain, we base our decisions on past experience and current facts. Reserves are based on claims reported prior to the end of the year and estimates of incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims. We regularly review and update reserves using the most current information available. Any resulting adjustments are reflected in current calendar year insurance losses and policyholder benefits. We estimate that we may recover some of our costs through salvage and subrogation.   \nPolicyholder DividendsCertain workers’ compensation policies include the possibility of a policyholder earning a return of a portion of premium in the form of a policyholder dividend. The dividend generally is calculated by determining the profitability of a policy year along with the associated premium. We reserve for all probable future policyholder dividend payments. We record policyholder dividends as other underwriting expenses. Life InsuranceWe offer several types of life insurance and we account for each according to the duration of the contract. Short-duration life and health contracts are written to cover claims that arise during a short, fixed term of coverage. We generally have the right to change the amount of premium charged or cancel the coverage at the end of each contract term. We record premiums for short-duration life and health contracts similarly to property casualty contracts. Long-duration contracts are written to provide coverage for an extended period of time. Traditional long-duration contracts require policyholders to pay scheduled gross premiums, generally not less frequently than annually, over the term of the coverage. Premiums for these contracts, such as whole life insurance are recognized as revenue when due. Some traditional long-duration contracts, such as ten-pay whole life insurance, have premium payment periods shorter than the period over which coverage is provided. For these contracts, the excess of premium over the amount required to pay expenses and benefits is recognized over the term of the coverage rather than over the premium payment period.   \nCincinnati Financial Corporation - 2021 10-K - Page 129\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

The majority of our leased facilities are classified as operating leases that, on average, have initial lease terms of five to 10 years, with one or more lease renewal options to extend the lease term. Our lease renewal option terms generally range from one to five years. The exercise of the lease renewal option is at our sole discretion and may contain fixed rent, fair market value based rent or Consumer Price Index rent escalation clauses. We include option periods in the lease term when our failure to renew the lease would result in an economic disincentive, thereby making it reasonably certain that we will renew the lease. We recognize straight line rental expense over the life of the lease and any fair market value or Consumer Price Index rent escalations are recognized as variable lease expense in the period in which the obligation is incurred. In addition, we lease certain vehicles and equipment. Vehicle and equipment leases typically have lease terms ranging from one to seven years. We account for all leases, both operating and financing, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 842 Leases, (\"ASC 842\"). Our accounting policy provides that leases with an initial term of 12 months or less will not be included within the lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We will continue to recognize the lease payments for those leases with an initial term of 12 months or less in our Consolidated Statements of Operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term.The lease right-of-use assets and related lease liabilities are classified as either operating or financing. Lease right-of-use assets are calculated as the net present value of future payments plus any capitalized initial direct costs less any tenant improvements or lease incentives. Lease liabilities are calculated as the net present value of future payments. In calculating the present value of the lease payments, we utilize the rate stated in the lease (in the limited circumstances when such rate is explicitly stated) or, if no rate is explicitly stated, we utilize a rate that reflects our securitized incremental borrowing rate by geography for the lease term. We account for nonlease components (which include common area maintenance, taxes, and insurance) with the related lease component. Any variable nonlease components are not included within the lease right-of-use asset and lease liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and instead, are reflected as an expense in the period incurred.At January 1, 2019, we recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying ASC 842 as an adjustment to the opening balance of (Distributions in excess of earnings) Earnings in excess of distributions, resulting in an increase of approximately $5,800 to stockholders’ equity due to certain build to suit leases that were accounted for as financing leases under ASC 840, Leases, but are accounted for as operating leases under ASC 842. Operating and financing lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|   |  | DECEMBER 31, |\n| DESCRIPTION |  | 2021 |  | 2020 |\n| Assets: |  |  |  |  |\n| Operating lease right-of-use assets(1) |  | $ | 2,314,422  |  |  | $ | 2,196,502  |  |\n| Financing lease right-of-use assets, net of accumulated depreciation(2)(3) |  | 298,049  |  |  | 310,534  |  |\n| Liabilities: |  |  |  |  |\n| Current |  |  |  |  |\n| Operating lease liabilities |  | $ | 259,597  |  |  | $ | 250,239  |  |\n| Financing lease liabilities(3) |  | 41,168  |  |  | 43,149  |  |\n| Long-term |  |  |  |  |\n| Operating lease liabilities |  | $ | 2,171,472  |  |  | $ | 2,044,598  |  |\n| Financing lease liabilities(3) |  | 315,561  |  |  | 323,162  |  |\n\n(1)At December 31, 2021 and 2020, these assets are comprised of approximately 99% real estate related assets (which include land, buildings and racking) and 1% non-real estate related assets (which include warehouse equipment, vehicles, furniture and fixtures and computer hardware and software).

During 2021, there were 11 million stock options exercised, with a weighted-average exercise price of $12.07. The exercised options prices ranged from $6.19 to $15.37 during 2021. We received approximately $133 million in proceeds with an equivalent of about $197 million in new issues used to settle the exercised options. For options exercised during the year ended December 31, 2021, the difference between the fair value of the Common Stock issued and the respective exercise price was $64 million. As of December 31, 2021, the intrinsic value for vested and unvested stock options was $51.6 million and $63.2 million, respectively. The average remaining terms for fully vested stock options and unvested stock options were 2.3 years and 8.5 years, respectively. Compensation cost for stock options for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $2 million. As of December 31, 2021, there was no unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options. During 2021, no new stock options were granted.  \nNOTE 7. INCOME TAXES   \nWe recognize income tax-related penalties in Provision for/(Benefit from) income taxes on our consolidated income statements. We recognize income tax-related interest income and interest expense in Other income/(loss), net on our consolidated income statements.  \nWe account for U.S. tax on global intangible low-taxed income in the period incurred.   \nValuation of Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities  \nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards on a taxing jurisdiction basis. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid.  \nOur accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns and their future probability.  In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets.  If, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized, we record a valuation allowance.125\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

In May 2021, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC an application seeking to amend its certificate for the Searcy Solar facility to allow for the use of a tax equity partnership to acquire and own the facility. The tax equity partnership structure is expected to reduce costs and yield incremental net benefits to customers beyond those expected under the build-own-transfer structure alone. The APSC approved Entergy Arkansas’s tax equity partnership request in September 2021. AR Searcy Partnership, LLC was formed for the tax equity partnership with Entergy Arkansas as its managing member. In November 2021 both Entergy Arkansas and the tax equity investor made capital contributions to the tax equity partnership that were then used to acquire the facility. Upon substantial completion of the facility in December 2021, the tax equity partnership completed the purchase of the Searcy Solar facility. The purchase price for the Searcy Solar facility was approximately $133 million, which includes a final payment of approximately $1 million to be made in 2022. See Note 1 to the financial statements for further discussion of the HLBV method of accounting used to account for the investment in AR Searcy Partnership, LLC.  \nHardin County Peaking Facility  \nIn June 2021, Entergy Texas purchased the Hardin County Peaking Facility, an existing 147 MW simple-cycle gas-fired peaking power plant in Kountze, Texas, from East Texas Electric Cooperative, Inc. In addition, also in June 2021, Entergy Texas sold a 7.56% partial interest in the Montgomery County Power Station to East Texas Electric Cooperative, Inc. for approximately $68 million. The two interdependent transactions were approved by the PUCT in April 2021. The purchase price for the Hardin County Peaking Facility was approximately $37 million.  \nWashington Parish Energy Center  \nIn April 2017, Entergy Louisiana entered into an agreement with a subsidiary of Calpine Corporation for the construction and purchase of Washington Parish Energy Center, which consists of two natural gas-fired combustion turbine units with a total nominal capacity of approximately 361 MW. In November 2020, Entergy Louisiana completed the purchase, as approved by the LPSC, of the Washington Parish Energy Center. The total investment including transmission and other related costs, is approximately $261 million, including a payment of $222 million to purchase the plant.  \nChoctaw Generating Station  \nIn October 2019, Entergy Mississippi purchased the Choctaw Generating Station, an 810 MW natural gas fired combined-cycle turbine plant located near French Camp, Mississippi, from a subsidiary of GenOn Energy Inc. The purchase price for the Choctaw Generating Station was approximately $305 million.  \nDispositions  \nIndian Point Energy Center  \nIn April 2019, Entergy entered into an agreement to sell, directly or indirectly, 100% of the equity interests in the subsidiaries that own Indian Point 1, Indian Point 2, and Indian Point 3, after Indian Point 3 had been shut down and defueled, to a Holtec International subsidiary. In November 2020 the NRC approved the sale of the plant to Holtec. Indian Point 3 was shut down in April 2021 and defueled in May 2021. In May 2021 the New York State Public Service Commission approved the sale of the plant to Holtec. The transaction closed in May 2021. The sale included the transfer of the licenses, spent fuel, decommissioning liabilities, and nuclear decommissioning trusts for the three units. The transaction resulted in a charge of $340 million ($268 million net-of-tax) in the second quarter of 2021. The disposition-date fair value of the nuclear decommissioning trust funds was approximately $2,387 million and the disposition-date fair value of the asset retirement obligations was $1,996 million. The transaction also included materials and supplies and prepaid assets.  \n198\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

As required by the act, Ameren Missouri and other utilities have entered into standard contracts with the DOE, which stated that the DOE would begin to dispose of spent nuclear fuel by 1998. However, the DOE failed to fulfill its disposal obligations, and Ameren Missouri and other nuclear energy center owners sued the DOE to recover costs incurred for ongoing storage of their spent fuel. Ameren Missouri’s lawsuit against the DOE resulted in a settlement agreement that provides for annual reimbursement of additional spent fuel storage and related costs. Ameren Missouri received immaterial reimbursements from the DOE in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019. Ameren Missouri will continue to apply for reimbursement from the DOE for allowable costs associated with the ongoing storage of spent fuel. The DOE’s delay in carrying out its obligation to dispose of spent nuclear fuel from the Callaway Energy Center is not expected to adversely affect the continued operations of the energy center.DecommissioningElectric rates charged to customers provide for the recovery of the Callaway Energy Center’s decommissioning costs, which include decontamination, dismantling, and site restoration costs, over the expected life of the nuclear energy center. Amounts collected from customers are deposited into the external nuclear decommissioning trust fund to provide for the Callaway Energy Center’s decommissioning. It is assumed that the Callaway Energy Center site will be decommissioned after its retirement through the immediate dismantlement method and removed from service. The Callaway Energy Center’s operating license expires in 2044. Ameren and Ameren Missouri have recorded an ARO for the Callaway Energy Center decommissioning costs at fair value. Annual decommissioning costs of $7 million are included in the costs used to establish electric rates for Ameren Missouri’s customers. Every three years, the MoPSC requires Ameren Missouri to file an updated cost study and funding analysis for decommissioning its Callaway Energy Center. An updated cost study and funding analysis was filed with the MoPSC in November 2020 and reflected within the ARO. In February 2021, the MoPSC approved no change in electric rates for decommissioning costs consistent with Ameren Missouri’s updated cost study and funding analysis.Ameren and Ameren Missouri have classified the investments in debt and equity securities that are held in the nuclear decommissioning trust fund as available for sale, and have recorded all such investments at their fair market value at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Investments in the nuclear decommissioning trust fund have a target allocation of 60% to 70% in equity securities, with the balance invested in debt securities.The fair value of the trust fund for Ameren Missouri’s Callaway Energy Center is reported as “Nuclear decommissioning trust fund” in Ameren’s and Ameren Missouri’s balance sheets. This amount is legally restricted and may be used only to fund the costs of nuclear decommissioning. Changes in the fair value of the trust fund are recorded as an increase or decrease to the nuclear decommissioning trust fund, with an offsetting adjustment to the regulatory liability related to AROs. This reporting is consistent with the method used to account for the decommissioning costs recovered in rates. See Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters for the regulatory liability recorded at December 31, 2021. If the assumed return on trust assets is not earned, Ameren Missouri believes that it is probable that any additional funding requirements resulting from such earnings deficiency will be recovered in customer rates.The following table presents proceeds from the sale and maturities of investments in Ameren Missouri’s nuclear decommissioning trust fund and the gross realized gains and losses resulting from those sales for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | 2021 |  | 2020 |  | 2019 |\n| Proceeds from sales and maturities | $ | 439  |  |  | $ | 183  |  |  | $ | 260  |  |\n| Gross realized gains | 32  |  |  | 10  |  |  | 10  |  |\n| Gross realized losses | 6  |  |  | 3  |  |  | 2  |  |\n\n132\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

As a result of its equity interest in CFN, CHS is entitled to semi-annual cash distributions from CFN. We are also entitled to semi-annual cash distributions from CFN. The amounts of distributions from CFN to us and CHS are based generally on the profitability of CFN and determined based on the volume of granular urea and UAN sold by CFN to us and CHS pursuant to supply agreements, less a formula driven amount based primarily on the cost of natural gas used to produce the granular urea and UAN, and adjusted for the allocation of items such as operational efficiencies and overhead amounts. Additionally, under the terms of the strategic venture, we recognized an embedded derivative related to our credit rating. See Note 9—Fair Value Measurements for additional information.  \n15.

The Revolving Credit Agreement provides for a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a sub-limit of $150 million available for the issuance of letters of credit and a maturity date of March 2024. Under the Revolving Credit Agreement, the Company may request an increase in the amount of the credit facility commitments up to a maximum facility amount of $1.5 billion and the Company may request that the maturity date be extended for up to two additional one-year periods. The material terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement include the requirement that the Company maintain specific leverage ratios and limitations on indebtedness. In April 2020, the Company entered into an amendment to the Revolving Credit Agreement, which, among other things, deducts cash in excess of $500 million from indebtedness for purposes of calculating the operating income leverage ratio under the agreement. The interest rates and fees under the Revolving Credit Agreement are based on the Company's long-term senior unsecured non-credit enhanced debt ratings.

Right-of-use assets were further adjusted for any off-market terms of the lease. The remaining lease term is based on the remaining term at the Closing Date plus any renewal or extension options that the Company is reasonably certain will be exercised. Additionally, the Company has elected short-term lease treatment for those acquired lease contracts which, at the Closing Date, have a remaining lease term of 12 months or less. For the leases acquired through the Transactions, the Company will retain the previous lease classification. This resulted in an increase in both right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities of approximately $525 million and $523 million, respectively, as of the Closing Date.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n  \n 72\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty and unconditional purchase obligations with a remaining term of one year or less.Other Contractual Commitments. Represent amounts payable pursuant to agreements related to IT, human resources, and other service agreements.Due to the inherent uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash outflows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at July 31, 2022, we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $3,307 million of unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest and penalties as of July 31, 2022 have been excluded from the table above.21\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}
