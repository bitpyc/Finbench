  "CABLE TELEVISION COMPANY": "CABLE TELEVISION COMPANY  \n \nQ:  Your client is a small holding company th at ow ns three cable television companies in the \nNortheast:  Rochester, NY, Philadelphia and Stamford, CT.  Each of these three companies is \nprofitable, and each has been experiencing stea dily grow ing sales over the past few  years.  \nHow ever, the management feels that th e Northeast is not the fastest grow ing area of the \ncountry, and, therefore, acquired another cable te levision company in Tucson, Ariz ona a little \nover a year ago.  Despite every effort of management, the Tucson company’s sales have been \nstagnant, and the company has been losing money.  How  would you analyz e this situation, and \nwhat could be the cause of the poor performance of the Tucson cable company? \n \nTo be divulged gradually:  \n \nThe Tucson area is sm aller than Philadelphia, but larger than Rochester and Stam ford.  Tucson is \nalso growing at 12% per year on average.  Per capita incom e is higher than in Philadelphia and \nthe sam e as in Rochester and in Stam ford. \n \nOperating costs in Tucson are essentially the sam e as in the other m arkets.  The cost of \nprogram ming is based on num ber of subscribers and is equal across the nation.  Operating costs \nare com posed of variable item s:  sales staff, m aitenence, adm inistration and m arketing.  Only \nmaintenance is higher that in the other m arkets, due to the larger land area serviced.  Fixed costs \nrelate to the cable lines, which is a function of physical area covered. \n \nThe Tucson com pany has attem pted m arketing efforts in the past, such as free Disney \nprogram ming for  one m onth, free HBO for one month, free hookup, etc.  These program s have \nbeen m odeled after the other three m arkets. \n \nCable penetration rates in the three Northeastern m arkets average 45%.  The penetration rate in \nTucson is 20%.  These rates have been steady over the past three years in the Northeast.  The \npenetration rate in Tucson has only rised by 2% in the past three years in Tucson. \n \nThere is only one real substitute good for cable television:  satellite dishes.  However, m any \ncommunities are enacting legislation that lim its their usage in Tucson.  They are also \nprohibitively expensive f or most people. \n \nSolution : \n \nThe real error of m anagem ent results from  their failure to recognize another “substitute” good:  \nno cable television at all; television reception is far better in the desert Southwest than in \nNortheastern cities.  The lower penetration rate is m ost likely a result of  different clim ate \nconditions and lower interference in Arizona.  \n \n \n  \nPage 21",
  "CHILLED BEVERAGES": "CHILLED BEVERAGES \n \nYou are consulting for the manager of a division of a large consumer products company.  \nHer division produces fruit juices in three forms, all marketed under the same name:  \nchilled (found in the milk section of the superm arket, usually), juice boxes, and froz en \nconcentrate.  This division has sales of $600 million per year.  The entire company has sales \nof over $20 billion.  The chilled segment represents $120 million in sales per year.  While \njuice boxes and froz en concentrate are profitab le, chilled juices are only breaking even in \ngood quarters and losing money in bad quarters.  She has received a proposal from upper \nmanagement to sell the chilled juices busine ss.  What w ould you advise that she do? \n \nTo be divulged gradually : \n \nChilled beverages is a $5 billion dollar industry nationw ide.  There are tw o large players \nthat have 40%  and 25%  of the market, respectively.  Your client’s market share, 12% , \nmakes her third in the industry.   \n \nThe best available information indicates that the tw o market leaders are profitable. \n \nThe tw o market leaders are able to fund more advertising and more promotion, trade and \ncouponing that your client. \n \nThe m arket leaders produce pure orange juice and blends that are based on citrus juices.  Your \nproduct uses m ore elaborate blends of juices, usually with a base of pear or peach juice (95% of \nthe inputs) and flavored with cranberries, bananas,  mangoes, etc. (the other 5% of the inputs).   \nPear and peach juice are about the sam e price as or ange juice, but the other flavorings cost about \ntwice as m uch. \n \nThe m arket for chilled juices is essentially m others with school age children.  This is a highly \nprice sensitive m arket that loves coupons, prom otions, etc. \n \nBrand nam e is im portant in this m arket, as in juice boxes and frozen concentrate, as m others tend \nto prefer highly reliable products for their children.  However, the brand prem ium must be in line \nwith other branded products.  Therefore, all branded juices tend to sell in the sam e price range. \n \nOne plant in California produces all of the product, chilled, juice boxes and frozen.  It would be \ndifficult to find another use for the plant without a m ajor conversion. \n \nSolution:  \n \nThere are three choices: \n  \n  \nPage 22 Sell the chilled juice business.  This would, however, af fect the juice bix and f rozen concentrate \nbusinesses, as there are both advertising and m anufacturing synergies. \n \nSell all of the juice business.  This m ay be m ore feasible, as the buyer could capture the \nsynergies, but would not be too likely to turn the business around.  The selling price is likely to \nbe low. \n \nKeep the chilled juice business and rework the ingredients and costs.  This turns out to be the \nmost feasible option, as evidenced by the success of the com petitors.",
  "DISTILLED SPIRITS": "DISTILLED SPIRITS \n \nYou are consulting f or a m ajor United States producer of  distilled spirits.  Their prim ary \nproducts are a line of m id-priced vodkas and two brands of m id-range rum .  Over the past few \nyears, the business has becom e less and less profitable.  W hat could be causing this: \n \nOther inform ation:  \n \nThe split of product sold has consistently been 60% vodka / 40% run over the past few years.  \nThe selling prices of the two lines are essentially the sam e.  Overall sales are growing at about 3 \nto 5% per year, the sam e as the idustry average for these product lines. \n \nAn analysis of the costs reveals the follow ing: \n \n Production Costs have rem ained constant \n Advertising Costs have rem ained constant on average \n Distribution Costs have increased significantly \n \nThe products are sold throughout the country.  In 27 states, where alcohol is sold in privately \nmanaged superm arkets and liquor stores, “open” states, shelf space is extrem ely expensive and \ntrade prom otions are critical.  Such stores are alsom  becom ing less and less willing to hold \ninventory, which is increasing distribution costs by requiring m ore frequent deliveries.   In the \nother 23 states, liquor is only sold through state regulated liquor stores. Distribution costs in \nthese states is m uch lower, as there are far fewer outlets to service and central warehouses for the \nstate-run stores.  Advertising of alcohol is much m ore tightly regulated, and therefore, \nadvertising spending is lower. \n \n \nSolution:  \n \nA greater and greater share of the volum e is being sold in the “open” states, with sales in these \nstates increasing at about 10% per year.  Sales in the regulated states are actually decreasing.  \n  \nPage 23 Because the regulated states are less expensive to serve, and therefore, m ore profitable, the fact \nthat they represent a shrinking portion of the total has caused total profits to decline.",

Custom ers pay for trucking by the m ile.  The fixed cost of plant additions is \nroughly the sam e as the cost of a new plant of the sam e capacity. \n \nSolution : \nAs distribution is the second-largest cost item , it makes sense to m inimize distribution costs in \nchoosing the site of the next facility.  From  the data, it is safe to assum e custom ers that are \nfurther away are less inclined to buy due to the in creased trucking costs.

A possible analysis, line item  by line item : \n \nCost of goods sold:  RC Cola would be higher due to their lesser power in negotiating price \nbreaks from  suppliers. \n \nDistribution:  would be higher for RC Cola for two reasons.

  "BANK OF LUKE": "BANK OF LUKE \n \nMr. Check is the Director of Retail Lock Box Services for the Bank of Luke, a m edium -sized \nMidwestern bank.  The Retail Lock Box Departm ent consists of 100 clerks and 8 m anagers and \nsupervisors. Each year, in addition to their handling of retail lock box transactions, the Departm ent \ngenerated $1.5 m illion of fee revenue processing retail credit card and m ortgage paym ents (\"item s\") \nfor 75 com mercial accounts. The bank has m any other com mercial accounts that use other \ncompanies of'  their item  processing. In fact, the Bank recently lost the item  processing business for \none of its largest accounts to Vader Inc., the largest item  processor in the US \n \nThe item  processing industry has undergone dram atic changes in recent years.  Types of item s \nprocessed include credit card, m ortgage, and utility paym ents (checks), airline tickets, and coupons. \nIn the past, these item s were usually processed by the issuing com pany (e.g., airlines would process \ntheir own tickets) or by bank item  processing departm ents like the Bank of Luke' s. At banks, the \n  \nPage 44 processing of paym ent item s was done m ore as a service to bank custom ers rather than as a \nprofit-m aking endeavor. Hence, it received little fo cus from  managem ent. Historically, processing \nwas accom plished by verifying the correctness of incom ing paperwork and m anually sorting, filing, \nand totaling the item s: only the largest banks were highly autom ated. \n \nCom panies specializing in item  processing have em erged in the past ten years. Vader, Inc., the \nlargest such com pany, is a subsidiary of a sm all bank in Georgia. Each year Vader processes \nmillions of airline tickets and retail paym ents for hundreds of com panies, m ost of whom  are not \ncustom ers of its hundreds of com petitors m ost of whom  are not, custom ers or its parent bank. Vader \nuses high-speed processing equipm ent and is highly autom ated. Processing tim e is rapid and \nprocessing costs are low. In fact, because of this speed advantage, the parent bank is beginning to \nprofit from  the float of checks processed. Although industry wide a m ajority of item s are still \nprocessed by the issuing com pany or by sm all processors, it is expected that large processors. W ithin \nfive years, it is expected that m ost of the business will continue to m igrate to Vader and other large \nprocessors. W ithin f ive years, it is expected that Vader and the large processors will dom inate this \nmarket. \n \nVader had a significant cost advantage over sm aller operations, such as the Bank of Luke, because \nof the great econom ies of scale they gain from  processing such volum es of item s. In addition, Vader \nbenefits from  a more constant workload by processing both airline tickets and retail lock box \nreceipts: airline tickets have few peaks and valleys, whereas m ortgage paym ents always peak early \nin the m onth with very low volum es the rest of the m onth. Mr. Check believes that Vader quotes \nprices of 20 cents per item  to large prospective custom ers while the Bank of Luke processes item s \nfor 40 cents per item . \n \nThe President of the Bank, Mr. Kenobi, has asked Mr. Check to evaluate how the retail lock box \nservice can be m ade profitable; the service lost $100,000 last year. Mr. Check believes that the bank \nmust offer retail lock box services, and it m ust price the service to be com petitive with com panies \nsuch as Vader.

W e \npurposely leave the case rather vague, not suggesting any particular actions and offering little data. \nThe candidate should be given tim e to think about this case and propose solutions which are not \nreadily apparent: \n \n• Why not sell the business of these custom ers? \n• Why not offer increased services to justify higher fees?  \n• What is the strategic plan for the bank, and how does this unit fit into it?  \n• What does Mr. Check feel his unit should be generating?   (after all, $15,000 per em ployee is \npretty  low!) \n• Has he considered acquiring other banks’ custom ers to increase the econom ies of scale in his \nown operation?  \n \nThis case can also be used to discuss cost-cutting.

  "CANDY COMPANY": "CANDY  COMPANY  \n \nQ: Your com pany is a rather successful producer  of candy.  It originally started as a single \nproduct line.  The production process consists of two basic activities: m anufacturing and packaging. \n The firm  has also expanded its sales through product line extensions. Managem ent is concerned that \nsales are growing but profits are not increasing at the sam e rate. W hat can your com pany do?  \n \n Answer:  Candy Com pany \n \nA: This is a revenue vs. cost exercise. Margins are shrinking.  \n \n \n  \nPage 46 Find out about the critical com ponents of co st: raw m aterial, labor and fixed cost. Raw \nmaterials are com modities with cyclical prices which have f allen in recent years but are \nexpected to swing up again (this, as you have guessed, m akes the problem  worse.) Labor and fixed capital has increased per unit over-proportionally com pared with ten years ago. Find \nout that the com pany's controlling system  is still f ocusing on the m anufacturing part of  \nproduction and the cost explosion occurs in packaging (candy is candy, the product line \nextension is prim arily an issue of different  packaging.) Controlling schedules m anufacturing \nwhich is rather efficient already but not p ackaging, thus causing slack in labor and fixed \ncapital (sm all batch sizes, high setup tim es.) \n \n Possible solutions: reduce product line, introduce controlling/scheduling m easures for \npackaging. \n  \n Qualifier: Are the com pany’s custom ers (i.e. retailers) willing to accept the reduced product \nline? \n \n Find out about revenues: \n \n Revenue killers:  concentration of retailers, trade brands, retailers dem and large introductory \ndiscounts for new products, high failure rate of new products. \n \n Possible solutions: stream line product line, reduce low m argin trade brand production, \nemphasize pull m arketing, reduce introduction rate for new products. \n \n (Operational aspect):  optim al plant location with respect to transportation.  \n  \n Possible assum ptions: \n plant location at (x,y), national W Hs at (xi, yi), dem and per country given Di, cost linear \nwith distance, shortest travel di `between (x, y) and (xi, yi) allowed: TC= Sum (xiDI); \nsolution (requires iteration): dTC/dx = dTC/dy =0) \n \n Punch Line:  Should the com pany seek dom inance now?  \n \n Have the driving forces for fragm entation di sappeared?   No, the fragm enting factors from  \nthe m arket are still in place. The com pany has not changed its strategy in the fragm ented \nindustry, (dom inance m akes no sense) but has gained an advantage by operational changes.",

  "SCIENTIFIC INDUSTRY": "SCIENTIFIC INDUSTRY  \n \nA manufacturer of scientific instrum ents is experiencing declining sales in its m ajor product line. \nWhy? \n \nApproach  \nHere are som e questions which m ay help isolate the key issues: \n \n1.  Describe the instrum ent and what it does. (Goal: gather background inform ation on \nthe product). \n  Response:  The instrum ent, call it Y, is able to perform  elem ental m apping; that is, it \nis able to determ ine the specific com position of m aterial placed in the cham ber for \nobservation. Y is an accessory for larger and m uch m ore expensive instrum ent that \nfunctions alm ost exactly like a m icroscope, which we' ll call X. \n \n2.  What other products does our client m anufacture?  (Goal: gather background \ninformation on the client). \n \n  Response:  They recently began m anufacturing X, and also produce an unrelated \nproduct. \n \n  \nPage 52 3.  Can these instrum ents be used separately, and are they ever sold separately?  (Goal: \nunderstand the sales process and the potentially interactive role of the X and Y sales \nforces). \n \n  Response: X can be used by itself, but Y is essentially dependent on X for its \noperation. As a result. except for replacem ent sales, Y is rarely sold individually.  In \nfact, X' s sales force will frequently recom mend that a buyer purchase a certain Y \nwhile buying an X. Two years ago, over 30% of our clients sales were generated by a \nmanufacturer of X. \n \n4.  What is the current %?  (Goal: determ ine whether this could be a cause of the sales \ndecline). \n   \n  Response:  It is currently around 5% \n \n5.  Does our product X com pete with other m anufacturers of X, and particularly the \nmanufacturer that was selling our Y?   (Goal: understand reasons for our friendly X \nmanufacturer stopping prom otion of our product). \n \n  Response:  Yes it does com pete directly with it, and our client introduced the product \nabout 1 1/2 years ago. (You have discovered a significant portion of the sales \ndecline). \n \n6.  How does our product com pare to other Y' s? (Goal: determ ine whether others are \nbeating us on technological or other product features). \n \n  Response:  Our client' s product is regarded as one of the best in the m arket. \n \n7.  Is the m arket for X and Y growing, shrinking or flat?  (Goal: a shrinking m arket \ncould be a good explanation for declining com pany sales). \n \n  Response:  Both m arkets are flat. \n \n8.  Who uses X and Y?  (Goal: determ ine m arket segm ents). \n \n  Response:   There are two basic user groups: industry, prim arily sem iconductor \nmanufacturers, and academ ia (in research labs). W hat we' ve noticed lately is that the \nspecific users in each of these groups, who also happen to be the prim ary buyers, \nhave becom e relatively less sophisticated; that is, they are hired just to run the \ninstrum ents and know less about their technical qualities. These buyers have becom e \neven m ore dependent on the sales forces. W hat has happened is that our client \nalienated itself from  other m anufacturers of X at a tim e when a strong relationship \nwas becom ing even m ore im portant than it used to be. The buyers are relying m ore \nand m ore on the X sales force, who is typically called well in advance of the Y sales \n  \nPage 53 force. (The interviewer will not likely give you all of this inform ation at once.  \nQuestions about the buying process and changing decision m akers would have \nbrought it out) \n \n  This is the second part of the m ain reason for our clients declining sales:  in addition \nto \n  ruining our relationship with a m anufacturer of X by producing our own, we \nhappened to do so at a tim e when relationships becam e even m ore im portant.",

To recap, your \nclient sells a sim ilar product, in sim ilar am ounts, to sim ilar m arkets in Australia. Sim ilar design costs \n(in absolute costs) were incurred by your Japanese partner.  The key lies in your discovery that \ndesign costs are pro-rated, and a line in the description of the problem  that m entioned that your \nclient' s partner is one of the sm aller auto m anufacturers in the huge Japanese m arket.

A good place to begin is to evaluate the industry from  a com petitive analysis \nperspective, such as Porter' s five forces. The following is an abbreviated analysis. \n \n \n  Rivalry (low to m oderate):  managem ent consulting is fragm ented, with m any players \neach holding relatively sm all concentration of total m arket. Firm s act as com petitive \nmonopolists, and differentiate them selves by specialty, type of custom er (Fortune \n100 versus Fortune 1000 com panies), reputation (McKinsey versus accounting \nfirms), and the resources they em ploy (top MBAs versus all MBAs). Many \ncompanies are relationship-driven with their custom ers, which lim its com petition and \nkeeps prices high. Top tier firm s in particular are able to have high price points. \n \n  Potential Entry (moderate):  there are no great barriers to entry into consulting; \nhowever, few new consulting firm s truly com pete in the top tier. It' s possible new \nfirms would enter if the industry were earning positive econom ic profits and if they \nfaced certain im itability (e.g. the ability to recreate what the top tier firm s do). \n \n  Substitutes (moderate):  com panies can m ove the consulting process in-house by \nhiring exconsultants and bright MBAs. \n \n  Buyer Bargaining Power (m oderate-high):   In the last decade the consulting m arket \nhas boom ed, with supply generally following dem and, which lowers buyer power. \nHowever, it is appropriate to question effect recession m ight have on industry. It' s \npossible that dem and m ay decrease as com panies quit expanding, which would \nreduce dem and, give buyers m ore bargaining power, and push prices lower. \n \nSupplier Bargaining Power (low-m oderate):  Major suppliers are the intellectual capital em ployed \nby firm  (e.g. experienced consultants who bring in sales and new consultants who \nprovide analytics). Must pay m arket price or risk losing suppliers. \n \nOther interesting points m ight explore the key success factors in the consulting industry. W hat sets \ntop tier f irms from middle ones?  Do any f irms have specif ic sustainable com petitive advantages? \nHow does the m arketing m ix differ am ong firm s? Does your firm  have any specific core \ncompetencies or advantages that set it apart from  other com panies? \n \nDeterm ining likely future scenarios is m ore am biguous. There are at least several key point: what \neffect will a recession have on consulting firm s? W ill top tier firm s suffer differently from  others? \n  \nPage 59 How will the m ix of products dem anded change (e.g. cost-cutting studies rather than m arket \nexpansion studies)? W ill the consulting m arket continue to expand or suf fer a cutback?  Or, will \ncertain geographical areas expand (Pacific Rim , Eastern Europe) faster than others?   Again, the \nthought process is m ore im portant here than actual answers. \n \n2.  Inform ation gathering is a key reason com panies use consultants. An interviewee \nshould have a decent understanding of business inform ation sources and how \ninform ation is gathered. \n \n  Inform ation can be broken into two groups: secondary and prim ary. Usually one \nbegins with secondary m aterial, specifically, a com plete review of published \nliterature (a \"lit search\") pertaining to the study (e.g. journal and newspaper articles, \ninvestm ent bank research, specialized studi es, books, etc.). This often points towards \nother good sources (e.g. industry experts, associations, m ajor com petitors, \ngovernm ent sources, etc.).  Hypotheses are often created from  the secondary \ninform ation. Prim ary research is then used to focus in on the key issues.   This \nresearch includes telephone interviews, in-person interviews, m ailed questionnaires, \nfocus groups, laboratory experim ents, etc. \n \n3.  This answer will depend upon the m aterial covered in the first two. Ask the \nquestions: W hat trends are likely?  W hat is a positive scenario?  A negative one?  If  \nyou had any inform ation at your disposal, how could you get a better handle on this \nissue?  \n \n4.  There is no right answer here, so the interviewee m ay balk. However, you can \nprovide som e structure. W hat are the key success factors to succeeding in the \nindustry?  Is there any way to achieve sustainable advantage which cannot he \nduplicated by your com petitors?  Can you use non-traditional m ethods to achieve \ncompetitive advantage, such as leveraging through technology.  Given your firm 's \ncompetitive strengths and core com petencies, what is the best strategic route? \n \n \nSKYSCRAPER \n \nYour client is going to build a skyscraper, but is not sure how m any stories to m ake it. How should \nhe decide?  \n \nApproach  \n \nThis is an economic supply/demand mind tease. Clearly you don't w ant to lose money on the \ndeal. Rebuilding w ill house tenants, w ho will pay to reside there. The costs of building and \nmaintaining the structure (both fixed and increm ental by story) need to be compared to \n  \nPage 60 revenue generating capacity of the project.  When marginal revenue equals marginal cost you \nstop adding stories. \n \n \nCORN FEED COMPANY  \nQuestion  \n \nA corn feed com pany has eight m anufacturing plants located in the Midwest. These plants service \nthe entire United States.  Their plot in Ohio is in need of refurbishing.  The com pany has four \npossible options: \n \n  I. Refurbish the existing plant \n  2. Build a larger plant at the current location \n  3. Build a sim ilar size plant at a new location \n  4. Build a larger plant at a new location \n \nWhich is the best option for this plant?  \n \nAnswer  \n \nThere are two issues to this decision. The plant size and the plant location should be considered \nseparately. \n \nl. Size of Plant \n \nFirst consideration is the demand for the product. Corn feed is a com modity product. Pricing on the \nproduct is dependent on current corn prices as opposed to the m anufacturing process.  There are four \nmain com petitors - our com pany is the second largest.  All four com petitors have sim ilar \nmanufacturing processes and sim ilar cost structure.  The purposed largest plant will not have \neconom ies of scales not currently present a the existing plant. The capacity utilization is 65% which \nis industry standard. The current custom ers buy from  all four m anufacturers in order to guarantee \nsupply. Currently dem and is being m et and there are no alternative use for corn feed. \n \n2. Location of Plant \n \nTransportation cost and perishability are the m ain issues with location. The transportation cost for \nthe corn stock (raw m aterial) is m uch higher than the cost of transporting the actual feed. The corn is \ngrown in the Ohio area and the feed is sold to the East Coast. The raw m aterial is perishable where \nas the corn feed can be stored for any length of tim e and easier to transport.  Cost analysis of the \ntransportation cost of feed versus raw m aterials should be com pleted. Included in this analysis would \nbe the % of spoilage for longer transportation of corn stock \n \nConclusion  \n  \nPage 61  \nThe current plant is located close to the corn fields and this is the best location for the plant from  the \ncost/benefit analysis.",
  "SELECTIVE BINDING CASE": "SELECTIVE BINDING CASE \n \nYour client is a m ajor fashion m agazine that has been offered by its printer a proprietary new \nprocess called selective binding which enables publishers to custom ize the pages included in readers'  \nmagazines based on dem ographic data known about the reader. For exam ple, an ad in Better Hom es \n& Gardens for lawn chem ical services could be placed only in those issues going to subscribers who \nlive in houses and not to those living in condom inium s or apartm ents. In this way, advertisers can \nfocus their com munications on the dem ographic segm ent they are targeting. W ould you advise your \nclient io take advantage of this new process and offer selective binding to its advertisers?  \n \nAnalysis  \n \nThis is a pretty straightf orward cost/benefit analysis.  The Magazine would want to consider offering \nthe service to its advertisers if it would be able to enhance its earnings by being able to charge its \nadvertisers a prem ium for being able to m ore exactly and efficiently target the dem ographic segm ent \nthey want to reach. Of course the increased revenue from  the any prem ium must be able to offset any \nrevenue lost as advertisers stopped targeting.  The interviewee could start the analysis by obtaining \nthe following inf ormation f orm the interviewer: \n \nQ: What dem ographic breakdowns can be m ade in the m agazine' s database?  \n \nA: The only breakdown possible on your database is between subscribers who m ake under \n$50,000 and those who m ake over $50,000. \n \nQ: What it total readership, the proportion of readers who are subscribers (as opposed to \nnewsstand buyers), and the proportion of subscribers in each dem ographic category?  \n \nA: There are l m illion readers, 80% of  who are subscribers. Twenty-f ive percent of  subscribers \nmake under $50×000, 75% m ake over $50,000.  The sam e mix applies to the newsstand \nbuyers according to readership audits. \n \nQ: What proportion of the client' s advertisers target each dem ographic category of readers?  \n \nA: Most advertisers are selling high-end fashion products, so 75% of them  are targeting the high \nincom e group. \n \n  \nPage 62 Q: What is the cost of the selective binding service and what does the m agazine charge for its \nads? \n \nA: The service is being offered to your client fr ee for 3 years since the printer wants to prom ote \nthe service' s use by getting a m ajor m agazine to start using it. The client charges $50 per \nthousand per full-page ad (selective binding can only be offered on full-page ads). Therefore \nrevenue associated with a single inserted page (front and back) in an issue is $100 per \nthousand. \n \nQ: What does the client' s closest direct com petitor f or advertisers charge f or ads and what is \ntheir readership like? \n \nA: The client' s closest direct com petitor has 500,000 readers, 100% of whom  are subscribers. \nEffectively, all of their readers m ake over $50,000. They charge $70 per thousand for their \nfull one page ads. \n \nSince the printing cost to the client of selective binding is zero, the client sim ply needs to evaluate \ncost on the basis of revenue per thousand gained or lost as their advertiser base uses the \nservice to better target their ads to their desired segm ent. Presum ably, instead of 100% of \nadvertisers paying the full $50/thousand per page, the 25% of advertisers targeting the lower \nincom e segm ent will choose to advertise only to the 25% of subscribers targeting the high \nincom e segm ent will choose to advertise only to the 25% of subscribers falling into that \nsegm ent and the 75% of  the advertisers targeting the high incom e segm ent will advertise \nonly to the high incom e subscribers (75% of subscribers). Assum e that all advertisers \ncontinue to advertise in 100% of the newsstand copies. The revenue effect of this change can \nbe calculated by looking at the im pact the change would have on average ad rate per \nthousand on subscription readership: \n \nNew ad revenue per page = Old ad revenue per page X [(% low incom e subscribers X % low \nincom e target advertisers) + (96 high incom e subscribers X % high Incom e advertisers)] \n \nThus \n \nNew ad revenue per page = $50 X [(25% X 25%) + (75% X 75%)] \nat old rate $31.25 < $50 \n \nNow the question is, can ad rates per thousand on the selective binding portion of ads sold be \nincreased sufficiently to increase average revenue per thousand over what it is today?   To answer \nthis question, your client' s ad rates m ust be looked at from  the perspective of their advertisers. If you \nconsider the advertisers targeting the high incom e group, their alternative to advertising in your \nclient' s magazine is to put their ad dollars toward the 100% high-incom e readership com petitor. The \ncost per thousand high-incom e readers with the com petitor m agazine is: \n \n  \nPage 63 (Page rate X total readership)/ (portion of  readers who are high incom e) = ($70 X 500,000)/500,000 \n= $70 \n \nThus $70 is the m aximum price per thousand the client can charge its advertisers for selectively \nbound ads before the advertisers would switch to their com petitor. Note that currently, the client is a \ncheaper buy for these high-incom e advertisers even though they are paying to reach readers they do \nnot want: \n \n($50 X 1 m illion)/750,000 = $66.67 \n \nIf the client charged $70/thousand for selectively bound ads, average revenue per thousand to the \nclient would be: \n \n$70 X [(255 X 25%) + (75% X 75%)) = $43.75 \n \nSince $43.75 is less than the $50 that advertisers are currently paying, the m agazine should not offer \nadvertisers the selective binding service. \n \nOf course, there are other issues which interviewees m ight want to m ention such as the possibility of  \nprice discrim inating between high and low incom e advertisers, the potential for and cost of \nexpanding the advertising base using selective binding as a selling tool, etc. However, it is im portant \nby the end of the interview to have reached a recom mendation regarding the initial question posed \nby the interviewer. To m ention these other possibilities and areas f or further investigation is \ncertainly worthwhile, but it is also im portant not to get too far off track or to com plicate the issue so \nmuch that a final recom mendation is never reached. \n \n \nVIDEO GAMES \n \nPurpose:  To determ ine whether the candidate is able to structure a basic industry analysis. \n \nBACKGROUND  \n \nThe CEO of a large diversified entertainm ent corporation has asked a McKinsey team  to exam ine \nthe operations of a subsidiary of his corporation that m anufactures video gam es. Specifically, he \nneed to know it. he should approve a $200 m illion capital request for tripling the division' s capacity. \n \nQUESTION  \n \nYou are a m ember of the McKinsey team  assigned to this project. Assum e you and I are at the first \ntearn m eeting.  W hat are the critical issues we should plan to exam ine to determ ine if the industry is \nan attractive one for continued investm ent and why?  \n \n  \nPage 64 The following inform ation m ay be given if requested by the candidates though you should focus on \nhaving the candidate identify issues, not obtain m ore inform ation. \n \nMarket share  \nDivision is third largest m anufacturer of hardware in the industry with 10 percent m arket share.  Top \ntwo producers have 40 and 35 percent m arket share. Rem ainder is divided by sm all producers. \nDivision sells to broad range of consum ers. \n \nSales  \n• Division sales have increased rapidly over last year from  a relatively sm all base. Current \nestim ate is \nannual sales of 500,000 units. \n   \n• Current estim ate of industry hardware sales is 5,000,000 units annually. Industry growth has \nbeen strong though over last few m onths, sales growth has slowed.   \n• Divisions current sales price for the basic unit is $45 per unit.  \n• Division rem ains less than 20 percent of parent com pany sales.   \n• Top two com petitors also develop, m anufacture and sell software/gam es though division sells \nonly licensed, software.   \n• Industry growth of software continues to increase. \n \nCosts  \n \n• Division estim ates current cost is $30 fully loaded. Requested expansion should reduce the cost \nby 5 to 7 percent and triple production of the hardware units.   \n• Top two com puters are estim ated to have a 10 to 15 percent cost advantage currently.   \n• Main costs are assem bly com ponents and labor. \n \nCustom ers \n \n• Division estim ates m uch of initial target m arket (young fam ilies) has now purchased the \nvideogam e \nhardware.   \n• No large new user segm ents have been identified. \n \nDistribution  \nPrim arily outlets of distribution are top end electronics stores. \n \nProfitabilitv  \nDivision currently exceeds corporate return requirem ents; however, m argins have recently been \nfalling. \n \nProduct  \n  \nPage 65 Hardware standards have been established by the industry leaders. \nProduct features constantly developed (e.g., new rem ote joy stick), to appeal to m arket segm ents. \n \nNote to the Interviewer  \n \nThe prim ary issue of the case is to determ ine if the industry is attractive and, especially, if our \nclient' s position in that industry is sustainable. The candidate should identifv issues which are \nnecessary for assessing both the industry and our c lient's position, but should not be expected to \nsolve the problem . \n \nIf the candidate begins to discuss too deeply a sp ecific issue, before having covered the key issues \noverall: bring them  back to discuss the Industry m ore broadly by asking \"what other issues m ust be \nexam ined?\" \n \nIf the candidate is discussing issues which seem  irrelevant to the attractiveness of the industry, ask \n\"how will that analysis help to assess the attractiveness of the industry or our client' s position”.   \nThen, ask the candidate to identify other issues which m ust be exam ined. \n \n \nMINIMUM REQUIREMENTS  \n \nThe following issues would need to be covered for the candidate to have done an acceptable job: \n \nl.  What is f uture m arket potential?  Candidate needs to question the continuation of \noverall industry growth.  She/he m ight ask about the saturation of m arkets, \ncompetitive products (hom e com puters), and declining \"per capita\" usage. \n \n2.  What is the com petitive outlook?  Should at least recognize the need to exam ine \ncompetitive dynam ics.  Issue areas m ight included: concentration of m arket shares; \ncontrol of retail channels; and R&D capabilities (rate of new product introductions, \netc.). \n \n3.       What will be the price/volum e relationship in the f uture?   Issues of prices need to be \n  considered. \n \n \nBETTER/OUTSTANDING ANSW ERS \n \nNo bounds on creativity, but better answers would address: \n \nMarket Potential  \n \n• Recognize that there is a relationship between m arket penetration and growth in new users \nwhich, \n  \nPage 66 when com bined, yields an industry volum e estim ate. \n \n• Address the shifting m ix of product purchases, in this case from  hardware (player unit) to \nsoftware \n(video cassettes). \n \n• Seek to look at buyer behavior in key buyer segm ents, i.e., \"fad\" potential of product. \n \nSoftware  \n \n• Recognize technology standards are set by industry leaders.  In this situation, the division as a \nsecondary player will have to follow these standards. \n \n• Recognize that different distribution needs m ay exist for different products (In this case, \nhardware \nversus software). \n \n• Discuss the effect capacity additions can have on overall industry price/volum e relationships and \non \nindustry price levels. \n \nCom pany’s Ability to Com pete \n \n• Should ask what the capacity expansion is designed to do. \n• Explore the cost position of  the client division relative to that of  other com petitors. \n• Seek to understand reason for poor profit perform ance of division \n \n \n \nCONSULTING FIRM (2) \n \nQ: Your client is the treasurer in a significantly privately held corporation. She is in charge of \nmanaging a portfolio of investm ents in addition to her treasury responsibilities. Recently, she has \nasked your advice about the purchase of a large position in com pany 456, whose stock is listed on \nthe NYSE. \n \n Com pany 456 is currently selling for $22 per share. The treasurer' s investm ent analyst \npredicts that the stock will pay a dividend of $1.25 for the foreseeable future.  Short-term  \ntreasury bills are yielding 7 percent, and long-term  t-bills are yielding 8 percent. The \ntreasurer is contem plating the purchase of 5000 shares of com pany 456 and wants your help \nin determ ining a fair m arket price. \n \n  \nPage 67   How would you go about determ ining a fair price for com pany 456?   \n \nAnswer.:  Consulting Firm  (2):   $22 per share",
  "STEAM BOILER HOSES": "STEAM BOILER HOSES \n \nProfit Im provem ent \n \nPURPOSE   To determ ine whether the candidate is capable and com fortable with \nconstructing a logical fram ework which will expose opportunities for profit \nimprovem ent. \n \nBACKGROUND  \n \nMcKinsey was asked by a diversified m anufacturing client to help turn around the steam  boiler hose \ndivision. This boiler hose division provides boiler hoses for both external custom ers and the client' s \nboiler division. Background inform ation on the client and industry includes: \n• Boiler hoses are sold both with original equipm ent and as replacem ents. \n• There has been increasing price pressure in the industry. \n• The client is third of eight industry participants. \n \nThe following inform ation is also available in response to questions asked by the candidate: Last \nyear's P&L showed (as a percent of sales): \n   R aw Material   7 0% \n   L abor    2 0% \n   Distributed overhead  10% \n   S G&A    15% \n \n   P rofit    ( 15%) \n \nThe raw m aterial is a com modity petrochem ical. \nAt least two of the other com panies in the industry are m aking m oderate profits. \n \nQUESTION  \n \nHow would you structure an analysis aim ed at re storing profitability?  Where do you expect to be \nable to save costs?  \n \nMINIMUM REQUIREMENTS  \n \nThe candidate should avoid getting bogged down in the following areas: \n \n  \nPage 68   1. Drop the product line (apparently not possible because hoses are necessary \nfor boiler sales). \n  2. Raw m aterial prices (they are the sam e as everyone else' s) \n  3. Allocation of  overhead (no cash savings and provides little potential) \n  4. SG&A (standard industry fee paid for independent installers). \n \nBETTER ANSW ERS \n \nBetter answers will m ove beyond the previous answers to consider: \n \n  l. Scale econom ies (client is big enough to achieve scale production). \n  2. Production technology (client has a m odern plant) \n  3. Labor costs (wages rates and productivity are average for the Industry) \n  4. Raw m aterial purchasing practices (m aterial are purchased through long term  \ncontracts with prices based on the spot m arket m inus a discount). \n \n \nOUTSTANDING ANSW ERS \nThe best answers, following a logical progre ssion, should stum ble upon the actual answer: the \nproduct has been over-designed, requiring excess raw m aterial.  The answer should the following \norganizational im plications: \n \n  l. How is our product engineering operation wired into the m arketplace?  (there \nis little contact between the engineering and m arketing/sales organizations) \n \n  2. What kind of feedback are we receivi ng form  our sales force?  (custom ers are \ndelighted with our hoses, but require all the product features) \n \n  3. Are there other areas in the com pany where sim ilar problem s exist? \n \n \n \nPOTS & PANS \n \nA manufacturing com pany based in Charleston, SC m akes high quality pots and pans which are sold \nthroughout the U.S.  in specialty and departm ent stores. You are called in because they feel that the $ \nl million that they spent on distribution last y ear was way too high. How can you show your client \nmoney that he can save m oney. \n \nApproach  \n \nDistribution is basically a trade-off between cost and service level. The higher the service level, the \nhigher the cost (m ore inventory pools, warehouses and shipm ents). So you need to ask where the \n  \nPage 69 inventory is being held. It turns out that stores, since they sell so few of these pots and pans, hold no \ninventory and thus require next-day replenishm ent after a sale. The next thing you need to know is \nwhere the warehouses are located, since the closer they are to the stores the cheaper the distribution \ncosts. Your client has three warehouses - one in Charleston, one in Philadelphia and one in LA - \nfrom  which they cover the whole country.  \n \nA quick way to solve this case is to realize that if stores require next day service from  these three \nwarehouses, the only way they can do this is by shipping overnight at a prem ium rate (UPS - no \nwonder they' re spending so m uch). You can save them  a bunch of m oney by closing down \nPhiladelphia and LA and shipping everything from  the plant In Charleston by UPS (negotiate a \nvolum e rate). This can be confirm ed by asking for the annual sales which turns out to be 10,000 \nunits. W hen you divide this into the $1 m illion distribution cost you discover that they are pay $100 \nto deliver a pan to the store. Beat this figure and you' ve earned your exorbitant fee.",

The candidate should cover \ndifferences for each product in the fixed and vari able m anufactrnrering and selling cost and prices, \nas those m ust be determ ined to understand each product' s profitability. The interviewee should also \naddress the m arket dem and for each product (to ensure what is produced can be sold at an acceptable \nprice). \n \n If the candidate is discussing issues which are not relevant to the profitability of each product line or \nto maximizing the prof itability of  the plant, repeat the question and ask how the issue being \ndiscussed will lead to a solution f or the client. \n \nMINIMUM REOUIREMENTS  \n \nCandidate should, at a m inimum, address the following issues: \n \nl. Are there m arket lim itations to the potential production of any one m aterial?  \n2. Is there com petition for these products? \n3. Are there differences in costs in the m anufacturing of these m aterials?  For exam ple, do som e \ncoatings cost m ore than others?   Do som e materials have inherent cost differences?  \n4.      Is there flexibility in pricing of these products? \n \n \nAdditional and observations should include: \n \n1. Are there differences in setup tim e and cost for various m aterials or coatings?  \n2. Do these m aterials m ove at different speeds through the m achines?  \n3. Are the m achines truly interchangeable or are som e better suited to one product oranother?  \n4. Is there unlim ited m arket dem and for these products?  \n5. Are there technological displacem ent or replacem ent products on the horizon?  \n  \nPage 73  \n OUTSTANDING ANSW ERS \n \n The best candidates will f ormulate a prof it maximization algorithm .  The best algorithm  is to \nmaximize the profit contribution per m achine hour. \n \n  1. Profit contribution is (unit volum e) tim es (unit price m inus variable cost). \n  2. Machine-hour capacity is a surrogate for fixed costs per unit of volum e. \nFixed costs take into account depreciation and standby costs as well \nas those costs that are independent of the variable costs per pound or \nton produced. \n  \n An outstanding answer m ust include recognition of the asset costs and capital im plied by \nthat, as well as the incom e or profit contribution. Also, the potential substantial differences in \nvolum e produced per m achine-hour and/or the price obtainable in the m arket dem and and \ncompetitive actions.",
  "SUPER REGIONAL BANK": "SUPER REGIONAL BANK \n \nYou have a have recently been assigned to a project with one of the nation’s super regional \nbanks.  The bank is one of the top 10 largest retail banks in the country.  Like m ost banks in its \nclass it has branches in 8 geographically contiguous states. \n \nYour client has recently concluded that the old “local branch” way of business is no longer \nviable.  Typically, this bank has canvassed its territory with sm all free-standing branches; \nhowever, the new age of electronic banking and com merce is changing all of that. \n \nThey are considering replacing m any branches w ith Calling Centers.  Calling Centers offer both \nlive and phone autom ated services that m ay be accessed by phone.  The new Centers would offer \nvirtually all of the services currently offered through local branches plus som e additional things. \n \nThe question to you is:  how would you go about setting up the engagem ent to determ ine the \nviability of this new concept?   Specifically, what  kinds of things would you investigate?   and \nwhat hypothesis would you form ?  \n \n \n \nPossible Solution : \n  \nPage 74  \nThis is a very open broad-brushed case.  There certainly is no right answer; however this type of \ncase occurs frequently. The following is a guideline of som e things you should probably \nconsider: \n \nMarket analysis:  W hat kinds of custom ers would be attracted to this no service?   What kinds of \ncustom ers would be turned off?   (Hypothesis:  younger people would be heavier users and m ore \nattracted than older)  Of the people attracted to this new service, how profitable are they?   How \nprofitable are the people who are turned off by this service?   (Hypothesis:  older people have \nmore money and thus are m ore profitable)  \n \nRevenue:  W hat types of  new services could be added to increase revenues?  Autom atic bill \npaym ent, Fund transfer, etc. \n \nCost Savings:  How m uch would it cost to establish a Calling Center and what are the risks \ninvolved?   Do we have the expertise in-house to do this?   How m any branches could we close?   \nCan we cut down on traffic to existing branches - thus requiring less tellers?  \n \nSummary: It probably is best setup as a cost benefit analysis.  The num ber of new custom ers \ntimes the expected revenue from  them  plus the additional revenue generated by potential new \nservices plus the cost savings m ust outweigh the forgone revenue generated by the custom ers \nyou end up driving away. \n \n \nCIGAR BAR \n \nI was sitting in one of Chicago’s new specialty “Cigar Bars” around the end of August with a \nfriend.  It was a Saturday night and the weather wa s fair.  W hile enjoying one of the bar’s finest \nstogies and sipping a cognac, I asked m y friend how m uch he thought the bar was worth. \n \nOn the back of an envelope, how would you go about determ ining the value of this bar?  \n \n \nIssues to consider  \n \nWe arrived at the bar around 8:30pm .  There appeared to be 30 custom ers already there.  By \n11pm  the place had at least 70 custom ers.  I would estim ate the m aximum capacity to be close to \n100. \n \nThe bar sells two things:  liquor and cigars.  The average cost of a cigar is $8 and the average \ncost of a drink is $7. \n \nThere was one bar tender, a waiter and a waitresses.  All three were there the entire evening. \n  \nPage 75  \nThe bar is located on one of Chicago’s trendier streets with a lot of foot traffic. \n \nThe bar is open Tuesday thru Sunday from  5 pm  until 2 am . \n \n \n \nPossible Solution : \n \nThis is a straight forward valuation.  To perform  a valuation you m ust estim ate the cash flows \nfrom  the business and discount them  back using an appropriate weighted average cost of capital \n(WACC). \n \nRevenues:  One way to project revenues is to estim ate the num ber of custom ers per day or per \nweek and m ultiply that by the average expenditure of each custom er.  Keep in m ind that Friday’s \nand Saturday’s are typically busier than other days and that people tend to be out m ore during \nthe Sum mer than in the W inter. \n \nCosts:  There are two com ponents to costs:  fixe d costs and variable costs.  Under fixed costs \nyou m ight consider:  rent, general m aintenance, m anagem ent, insurance, liquor license, and \npossibly em ployees.  The only real variable cost is the cost of goods sold. \n \nValuation:  Subtract the costs from  the revenues and adjust for taxes.  You now have the annual \ncash flows generated from  the bar.  How long do you anticipate this bar being around?   Cigar \nbars are a trend.  In any case pick som e num ber for the expected life (4-5 years).  The discount \nrate should be a rate representative of W ACC’s of sim ilar businesses with the sam e risk.  \nPerhaps 20%.  This gives you a value of: \n \nValue = CF 1/1.2 + CF 2/(1.2)2 + ... + Cf n/(1.2)n",
  "NEW MAGAZINE": "NEW MAGAZINE \n \nYour client is the CEO of a publishing com pany that produces a line of educational m agazines as \nwell as a line of wom en’s m agazines.  Both businesses are profitable but are not growing \nquickly.  He want’s to start a third m onthly m agazine in the US targeted at 30-50 year old m en \n(eg. GQ Magazine)  His stated goal is to generate circulation revenues of $10 m illion in the first \nyear.  He has hired you to figure out whether this is possible. \n \nPossible Solution:  \n \nThis is an estim ation case.  The key here is to clearly define your assum ptions, the specific \nanwser is not im portant as long as you are m aking reasonable assum ptions.  For exam ple \n \n  \nPage 76 Target Custom ers \nThe total US population is approxim ately 240 m illion.  Based on a norm al distribution with the \naverage life span of 80 years, approxim ately 2/3 of the population falls between 30-50 or about \n160 m illion people.  Approxim ately 1/2 are m ale or 80 m illion. \n \nOf the 80 m illion 30-50 year old m en in the country, assum e that at least 1/2 would read a \nmagazine or 40 m illion.

Lets say \n$3/m agazine at the news stand and $2/m agazine for a subscription.  Now m ake som e \nassum ptions on how m any custom ers will buy on the news stand versus subscription, lets say \n50% subsrcibe (120,000) and 50% buy at the news stand (120,000).  This com es out to  $360,000 \n+ $240,000 or $600,000.  Finally, this is a m onthly m agazine.  For sim plicity assum e that all \ntarget custom ers buy a m agazine every m onth.  This would generate total revenues of $600,000 \nX 12 or $7.2 m illion. \n \nIn this case given the CEO’s stated goal of $10 m illion in circulation revenues, it would not \nmake sense to launch the m agazine.",
  "CASTOR MANUFACTURER": "CASTOR MANUFACTURER \n \n \nQ:   Your client m anufactures castors (the wh eels found on the bottom  of office chairs) out of \na plant in W est Germ any and One in East Germ any.  Over the past two years the com pany’s \nprofits have declined by 20% while revenues have been relatively flat.  You have been asked to \nfind out what is happening and suggest a course of action to reverse these trends. \n \nInform ation to be divulged slowly:  \n \nThe com pany operates in three divisions: 50% of sales are to hospital bed m anufacturers, 25% \nare to m op bucket m anufacturers, and 25% are to chair m anufacturers.  The hospital bed and \nmop bucket divisions are located in the W est Germ an m anufacturing operation, the hospital bed \ndivision is located in the East Germ an m anufacturing operation.   \n \n  \nPage 77 Breaking out each division as a separate profit center shows that revenues are up 10% for both \nmop bucket and chair divisions but down 10% for the hospital bed division.  Sim ilarly, profits \nare down 10% for both the m op bucket and chair divisions but are down 30% for the hospital \nbed division.   \n \nFurther investigation shows that labor is the m ajor com ponent of cost in m anufacturing castors.  \nIn the past two years, wages in the form erly state regulated East Germ any have skyrocketed.  \nThis is what is driving m ost of the increased costs.  Sim ilarly, the dem and for hospital beds (and \nthus castors) in East Germ any has declined as they have becom e more efficient at m anaging their \nhealth care system . \n \n \nA: \n \nThis is a typical revenue/cost case.

  "LOGGING COMPANY": "LOGGING COMPANY  \n \n \nBackground: \nYou are hired by a Canadian logging com pany to analyze its current operations and provide \nadvice on future operations.  The logging industry in Canada is regulated by the governm ent.  \nLand is leased to individual com panies by the governm ent.  The com pany is m aking a lot of \nmoney and is unsure why.  You have been asked to  determ ine: (1) W hy they are m aking \nmoney?  (2) Is it sustainable?  (3) Is it replicable?   \n \nAdditional Details: \n• Products:  The com pany produces lum ber boards of two sizes 2”x4” and 2”x8”.  Lum ber is a \ncommodity product and as such the com pany is a price-taker in the m arket. \nLeases:  The governm ent leases tracts of land at a annual price that is set to allow for a 12% \nprofit m argin for the entire logging industry.  Thus, all tracts of land have the sam e lease \nprice per acre.  The leases last for 99 years and the original lessee has the right of first \nrenewal on the lease. \n• Profit Structure:  The profit equation for the lum ber industry can be written as:  Profit per \nft^3 = Revenue per ft^3 - Non-land cost per ft^3 - Lease Cost per ft^3 \n  \nPage 78 • Revenues:  There is a revenue advantage for the com pany due to its product m ix.  Margins \nare higher on 2”x8” boards than on 2”x4” boards.  The com pany’s product m ix is m ade up of \n a greater percentage of 2”x8” boards than the “typical” logging com pany percentage. \n• Non-land Costs:  The com pany has a 5% cost  advantage in its ”tree-to-dock” production \nprocess.  There is no significant difference be tween the distribution costs am ong the industry \nfirms. \n• Production Process: The cost advantage is not generated by a better logging process (i.e. \nbetter equipm ent, m ore skilled laborers) but instead exists because of the exceptional quality \nof the trees on the particular piece of land that the com pany leases.  The m ineral content of \nthe land leads to faster growth of healthier trees which im proves both yield and turnover.  \nHealthier trees are straighter and easier to cut, thus reducing costs in each phase of the \nlogging process.  These healthier, taller, straighter trees yield m ore 2”x8” board-feet than is \ntypical and leads to the advantaged product m ix.  There are no significant econom ies of scale \nto the process. \n \nKey Points \n• The com pany leases land with a signif icantly higher quality of  trees. This leads to a revenue \nadvantage because m ore 2”x8” board-feet can be produced per acre of land.  Additionally, \nthere is a cost advantage because the higher quality inputs m ake the logging process easier \nand increase yields and turnover. \n• Since the leases are for 99 years and renewable, the current situation seem s sustainable. \n• Since it is unlikely that another piece of land sim ilar to this one exists or that another firm  \nwill give up advantaged land, the situation is not replicable.",
  "INFORMATION SERVICES COMPANY": "INFORMATION SERVICES COMPANY  \nBackground: \nYou are hired by a library inform ation services com pany that provides a com puterized article \nsearch product on CD-ROM.  The product allows users in a library to locate articles by keyword \nsearch.  The com pany currently has a weak m arket share of only 10% of all installed units.  The \ncompany wants to understand (1) why they have so sm all a m arket share, (2) what could be done \nto im prove the situation, and (3) where it should focus its resources. \n \nAdditional Details: \n• Com petition:  There is a single m ajor com petitor which has 50% m arket share.  The client \nand two other com petitors each have 10%; and the rem ainder is divided am ong m any \ncompetitors. \n• Market Segm entation:  The f ollowing table outlines m any of  the details of  the m arket \nsegm entation and client product data. \n \n \nType of Library  \nNum ber \nof \nLibraries Client \nMarket \nShare Major \nCom petitor \nMarket \nShare  \nCom petitive Features \n  \nPage 79 Academ ic 5000 20% 60%  \n• Research 500 80% 10% Search Quality, \nContent \n• Other 4500 13% 66% Content, Ease of Use \nPublic 10000 10% 40% Content, Ease of Use \nSecondary \nSchools 20000 ~0% 10% Price, Ease of Use \n• Product:  The client sells a CD-ROM based product which is used on a dedicated PC in a \nlibrary.  The product has different versions that are upgraded each year.  Each version is \nmarketed to a specific library segm ent.  Libraries are interested in m atching the article search \nto hardboard volum es available within the library.  The client’s product is considered to have \nthe highest quality of  article search. \n• Pricing:  The client sells its product at a 25% discount to the m ajor com petitor and has the \nlowest prices in the industry.  The pricing and profit schedule for each version are shown \nbelow. \nLibrary Client Price Client Profit per \nUnit Major Com petitor \nPrice \nAcadem ic $2000 >$500 $2667 \nPublic $1500 $500 $2000 \nSecondary School $1000 $100 $1333 \n• Com petitive Features:  Com petition within the industry focuses on four dim ensions: (1) \nSearch Quality, (2) Content, (3) Ease of Use, and (4) Price.  The table above indicates the \nrelative preference for these features for each m arket segm ent.  There is a trade-off between \nease of  use and search quality.  A better search requires a m ore skilled approach to keyword \nusage and often m akes the search m ore difficult.  The client’s product is considered to have \nthe highest quality search am ong the com petitors. \n• Production:  the product is created by program mers who seek to m atch the product to library \nvolum es.  Since the principal input is labor, the type of CD-ROM created can be altered \nrelatively easily. \n \nKey Points \n• The client’s product does not m atch the needs of the large segm ents of the m arket (i.e. the \nclient’s high quality of search only appeals to a sm all segm ent of the total m arket) ==> weak \nmarket share \n• The client should reallocate its resources to create products in the larger m arket segm ents -- \nproducts that em phasize content and ease of use over search quality. \nThe m ost profitable segm ent can be identified by using current client prices which should allow \nit to gain m arket share (due to the 25% discount to the m ajor com petitor) and calculating the \nmaximum market profit.  Academ ic = 5000 x 500= $2.5M; Public = 10000 x 500 = $5.0M; \nSecondary = 20000 x 100 = $2.0M.  Therefore, if we realign our product to em phasize ease of \nuse and content, the potential profit is 4500 x 500 + 10000 x 500 = 7.25M ( m inimum since \nprofit in academ ic segm ent is > $500 per unit). \n \n  \nPage 80",
  "PIPELINE COMPANY": "PIPELINE COMPANY \n \n \nCase Type:  Industry Analysis \n \nBackground: \nYou are hired by a large pipeline com pany to evaluate the current and future potential of the \npipeline industry.  The pipeline industry sprang up as transportation costs for m ineral extraction \ncompanies began to escalate.  There is currently 20,000 m iles of pipeline throughout the U.S.  \nWhat inform ation would you want to know about th e pipeline industry that could help you plot a \nstrategy for a pipeline com pany?  \n \nAdditional Details: \n• Industry Structure:  There are m any pipeline com petitors.  Pipeline can be characterized as \neither com mon carrier pipelines (~70% of all pipeline m iles) which are regulated by the \ngovernm ent and proprietary pipelines (~30% of all pipeline m iles) which are wholly located \non the private property of a firm  (e.g. a pipeline from  a port station to a near-shore refinery).  \nThere are m any suppliers of com mon carrier pipelines.  The second group (proprietary) is not \nregulated by the governm ent. \n• Products:  The pipelines carry liquid and gaseous m aterials -- crude oil, natural gas, m ethane \ngas, liquid nitrogen, refined oil products (gasoline), and chem icals. \n• Cost Structure:  There are exceptionally high fixe d costs involved in a pipeline.  The variable \ncosts are prim arily the electricity to power pum ping stations along the pipeline.  There are \ndifferent cost structures depending on the type  of product being m oved.  Pum ping crude oil \nalong the pipeline can cost as m uch as $2M/m onth in electricity for a station.  Gaseous \nproducts require considerably less energy to m ove. \n• Market Conditions:  U.S. proven reserves are dim inishing and foreign im ports are increasing. \n It is expected that for the next 5-10 years dem and will be steady. \n \nKey Points: (classic Porter analysis could be used -- This is rarely the case!!!) \n• Threat of Entry  is low because ... \n- there are high f ixed costs (high initial investm ent) \n- pipeline services are essentially a com modity product (com modity m arkets are slow growth and \nunattractive) \n• Industry Rivalry  is strong because ... \n- there are m any com petitors and switching costs are low \n- industry growth is expected to be slow (i.e. m arket share is im portant) \n- many com petitors use pipeline for in-house uses and only carry other products if capacity is \nunderutilized \n- there are very high exit barriers (i.e. there is a strategic relationship between refining and \npiping) \n• Substitute Products  are m any as witnessed ... \n- by proliferation of tanker cars and tractor trailer rigs for liquid and gaseous m aterials \n  \nPage 81 • Power of Suppliers  is not a significant factor. \nPower of Buyers  is not a significant factor because m any pipelines are regulated and there are \nmany buyers \n• Other considerations: \n- Product Mix:  The m argins on gaseous products is higher than heavy unrefined products. \n- Governm ent Regulation:  Margins are greatly affected by com mon carrier status.  Any future \nenvironm ental   regulations will cut even deeper into m argins. \n- Pipeline as a storage m edium :  For m any firm s the product in a pipeline can be a significant \nportion of its  inventory and the volum e in line m ust be considered in production.  The \nclassic question:  Is it better to  make product and sell it now at low prices or wait for \nprices to increase (e.g. crude oil prices)?   A large  pipeline could be a tem porary \nstorage f acility. \n- Operations:  Maxim izing profit m eans understanding the param eters of pum ping -- costs of \npumping at less  than full capacity; layout of pipeline and pum ping stations; products \nwhich can share the sam e pipeline;  construction of parallel pipelines. \n Market Differences:  The m arket for crude oil is very different than the m arket for specialty \nchem icals or  natural gas.  the pipeline m anager m ust aware of these rapidly changing \ncommodity m arkets to  maximize his profit \n",
  "AUTO MANUFACTURER": "AUTO MANUFACTURER \n \nBackground: \nYour team  is hired by a large U.S. autom obile m anufacturer (GM).  They are interested in your \nevaluation of their $10B after-m arket parts business.  This business can be segm ented into two \nsets of buyers: dealers authorized to sell GM parts ($8B) and non-dealer m erchandisers ($2B).  \nThis second group can be subdivided into m ass merchandisers and “service” providers.  Mass \nmerchandisers are of two types -- those which specialize in auto parts (e.g. Auto Zone) and those \nwhich sell diverse products including auto parts (e.g. Sears).  “Service” providers include \nGoodyear or W estern Auto.  GM would like for you to answer two questions: (1) Is there an \nopportunity to expand this part of the business?  (2) How would they go about doing it if they \nchose to expand?  \n \nAdditional Details: \n• Com pany Econom ics:  There are trem endous fixed costs in the auto business (including \nlabor).  All of  GM’s parts m anufacturing f acilities are f ully depreciated and they currently \nhave excess capacity. \n• Com petitors:  W hile Ford and Chrysler m ake parts f or their own cars, they are not nearly as \nintegrated as GM and tend to focus in specific parts categories.  There are hundreds of sm all \nparts m anufacturers which tend to focus on com modity-like auto parts (e.g. oil filters). \n• Products:  GM produces a full spectrum  of parts classified as either platform-specific or \nuniversal .  \n  \nPage 82  Platform -specific Parts Universal Parts \nTypes of Parts Body panels , brakes , transm issions , Spark plugs, filters , hoses , engines batteries \nMarket \nCharacteristics Sold through dealers under \nwarranty; high m argins/low volum e Sold through m any outlets; \nhigh turnover; strong \ncompetition; slim  margins/very \nhigh volum e \nGM Sales $8B $2B \n• Growth Rates:  The table below provides the basic facts about each m arket segm ent’s growth \nrate. \nMarket Segm ent Overall Market Growth \nRate Total Market Size \nDealer-authorized -35% per annum  $40B \nNon-dealer   \n• Mass \nmerchandisers +65% per annum  $70B \n• Service \nproviders +15% per annum  $30B \n \nKey Points: (Porter Five Forces analysis) \n• Threat of Entry is m inimal for a broad category because the fixed costs are very high.  \nHowever, a m anufacturer could go after a niche play if it were to develop an advantaged cost \nstructure or superior product.  Switching costs am ong consum ers is very low. \n• Industry Rivalry is im portant for the m ass merchandiser category because m argins are slim  \n(meaning price wars are m ore prevalent).  Brand nam es (e.g. Fram , AC Delco, AutoLite) are \nimportant to m any consum ers. \n• Substitute Products are relevant only in the sense that there are m any com peting products and \nfuture technologies such as electric cars could elim inate the need for m any types of parts. \n• Power of Suppliers is not a significant factor because inputs are com modity raw m etal and \nrubber. \n• Power of Buyers is im portant since there are few m ass merchandisers such as Sears or Km art \nand they dem and  full range of products and trem endous volum e discounts. \nGM’s Position:  GM m ay have a cost advantage due to its fully depreciated plants and excess \ncapacity in a fixed-cost environm ent.  Thus its variable costs m ust be below sales revenue.  Also, \nits brand nam es are respected and are valuable to m erchandisers in m aintaining m argins.  GM’s \nability to produce a full-range of products is also an advantage.  These advantages com bined \nwith the high growth rates for the non-dealer m erchandisers should m otivate GM to expand it \nbusiness in this segm ent.. GM should use its cost advantage, brand nam es, and full range of \nproducts to go after the m ost lucrative m arket -- the m ass merchandisers.",
  "DELI MEAT PRODUCER": "DELI MEAT PRODUCER \n \nBackground: \n  \nPage 83 You have been hired by a producer of deli m eats to investigate the cause of its recent decline in \nmarket share.  The client would like an action plan for resolving the cause of this decrease. \n \nDetails: \n• The Com pany: \n- Product:  The firm  produces plastic-wrapped packages of sliced deli m eats at all price points \n(generic, m idrange, and prem ium).  The m arket  share loss is prim arily in the prem ium \ncategory.  The deli m eats carry a well-known brand label. \n- Price:  Products in the prem ium category carry a higher price and have slightly higher m argins. \n Although  price decreases will garner m arket share, the com petitors have m aintained prices \nduring the recent loss  in market share. \n-Place (Distribution):  The product is sold in grocery stores and delis.  Com pany investigation \nhas shown that  grocers have m aintained the sam e amount of shelf facings and space for \nyour product (so the decrease  in share was not caused by changes in display or incentives \nprovided to the grocers by com petitors). \n- Prom otion:  Advertising and m arketing efforts have been steady during this period of decline \nand there has  been no noticeable change in the com petition’s efforts. \n• The Com petition:  There are three other com petitors in the deli m eat industry.  Each of these \ncompetitors has about 20% of the m arket share; the client has 40% of the m arket share.  \nOverall the m arket (generic, m idrange and prem ium) is growing.  The com petition uses the \nsame channels to sell its products. \n• The Custom er:  Although the custom er buying prem ium deli m eats has not changed, a survey \nof the custom ers indicated a variability in the quality of the product produced by the client.  \nSometimes the product was better than the com petition; som etimes not.  This was causing \ncustom ers to change to the com petition. \n \nSolution: \n• Production Process:  The client receives chunk m eat in bins which m eet a certain average \nquality m easurem ent.  Meat is rated on a scale of 1 to 100 (100 being best).  The client is in a \nlong-term  contract with a supplier for bins at three quality ratings: 40, 70, and 90.  Individual \nchunks within a bin m ay vary from  this average.  The prem ium deli m eats are m ade from  a \nmix of the three bins with the m ajority com ing from  the 90-rated bin.  Meat in the 90-rated \nbin ranges from  80-95 while m eat in the 70-rated bin ranges from  55-80.  The variability in \nthe quality of the prem ium product is being driven by the variability within a 90-rated bin. \n• To reduce the variability, the client could (1) negotiate with the supplier to narrow the range \nwithin a bin or (2) sort the m eat within the 90 -rated bin at his own f acility.  The im pact of  the \nfirst proposal will depend on the relationship with the supplier.  That is, is the client a m ajor \nbuyer; how m uch longer is the contract set to run.?   The second option will add cost to the \nproduction process and reduce m argins. \n \n  \nPage 84"
