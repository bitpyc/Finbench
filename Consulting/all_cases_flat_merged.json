  "Berkeley_2006_Private Equity Portfolio Strategy": "5.1. Private Equity Portfolio Strategy\nSource: A.T. Kearney 2006\nLength: Medium (30 Minutes)\nProblem:\nOur client is a private equity firm which operates primarily in the automotive industry.\nThey want us to investigate whether they should increase their portfolio in the sensor\nmarket? Also what criteria should be used by the client to identify target companies?\nInformation To Be Provided:\n• Market potential :\n• Electronics content in automotives will keep growing and is expected to represent\n17% of total purchased materials in an average vehicle by 2006.\n• Sensors will become a more and more important part of the automotive\nelectronics content — according to a previous study conducted by us, we estimate\nthey will represent approximately $150 on average per vehicle by the year 2005\n• Global growth potential beyond automotive e.g., aerospace, semiconductors,\nmedical devices and consumer electronics. Automotive and Aerospace being the\nbiggest growth areas\n• NPV analysis: To operate a company in sensor market requires an recurring\ninvestment of $10M, $11M and 12M resp. starting in year 0,1, 2. Our client has\ndone back of the envelope cash flow analysis that show that they can expect a\ncash flow of $12M after the first year growing at a rate of 5%. Assume a three\nyear outlook is sufficient to make a decision if the client should go ahead with the\ninvestment. Using this data, determine if the client should go ahead with the idea\nof investing in the sensor market. Assume cost of capital=10%\n• Key demand drivers: Increasing consumer demand; government regulation for\nsafety, environmental, and comfort in automotive.\n• Customer buying criteria: The OEMs are the customers of sensor manufacturers\nand they place a high value on leading-edge technology as electronic systems are seen\nas a source of differentiation.\n• Competition: The sensor market is extremely fragmented — leading sensor\ncompanies are aggressively using acquisitions and partnerships to grow by expanding\ntheir product, industry, geographic footprints and/or acquire promising technologies.\n• Cost Structure: Being in the sensor business requires significant continuing\ninvestments in terms of infrastructure and technology. However it is high margin\nbusiness and is likely to remain so for the next 4-5 years.\nSolution:\nThe data provided in this case clearly presents a very positive picture of the sensor\nmarket. The real answer lies in articulating and structuring the decision criteria for an\nacquisition target for our client. The interviewee should be able to quickly highlight 2\nHaas Consulting Club Case Book 20\n\nsuccess factors for sensor companies i.e. Profit growth potential of a company and the fit\nwith existing portfolio\nProfit/Margin Growth Potential:\n• What market segments is the company playing in? What is the growth potential of\nthese market segments?\n• What geographies and product and services are being addressed by the company\nand the future growth potential of each?\n• Does the company have strong existing customer relationships?\n• Technology Leadership: What is the technology focus of the company? What are\nthe R&D investments? How many patents are owned by the company?

Manufacturer of Ball Bearings\nSource: Deloitte Consulting, LLP\nLength: Short, 10-15 minutes\nCase Scenario\nOur client has had flat sales and declining profits for the last 3 years. The CEO believes\nthat high margin service businesses built on existing core competencies are the answer to\nhis problem.\nKey Questions\nFrom a Value Chain perspective, how would you assess whether or not there are\nopportunities to build sustainable new service businesses? Develop some potential\nbusiness models based on your assessment.\nPossible Recommendations / Approaches\nCandidate should be able to dissect the value-chain and identify procurement as a core\ncompetency.\nOne core competency of the company is the procurement department with its world-class\nprocesses and personnel. It also has access to 2000 buyers that work for its parent\ncompany.\nThe company has strong customer relationships with large manufacturing companies\nsuch as Caterpillar, John Deere, etc.\nLarge manufacturing companies usually buy several hundred components (from around\n500 suppliers), but build strategic relationships including electronic linkages with the top\n20 suppliers.\nSignificant cost savings have been realized through these strategic relationships, but\nextending them beyond the top 20 suppliers is not cost-effective.\nCase Wrap Up\nIn this scenario Deloitte Consulting recommended a new business model based on the\nclient’s procurement competency in which it will manage suppliers that fall below the top\n20 for its major strategic customers. The client leverages its web-enabled electronic\nlinkages to reduce costs and streamline the procurement process for components\npurchased from the less-than-top-20 suppliers.

  "Berkeley_2006_Wealth Financial Advisory Services to Affluent Individuals": "5.4. Wealth Financial Advisory Services to Affluent Individuals\nSource: Deloitte Consulting, LLP\nLength: Long (30-45 minutes)\nCase Scenario\nThe client is a provider of wealth advisory services to high-net-worth individuals.\nTypical wealth advisory services include: investment strategy and portfolio management,\nestate and trust planning, tax planning and preparation, insurance planning, family office\nservices (e.g., bill payment services) and the like. The client started out as a professional\nservices specialist to corporate clients, but over time, has successfully expanded into\nindividual wealth advisory services. Over time, the revenues generated from the wealth\nadvisory services component of the company grew to over $400M worldwide.\nTraditional players in this market are high-end private banks (e.g., JP Morgan), and\nboutique financial planners. These players do not offer their own products, but typically\nhave close partnerships or affiliations with those who do (e.g., mutual fund companies,\ninsurance companies and brokerage houses).\nWithin the last 12 months, several disruptive events have occurred in the marketplace.\nLarge and diversified financial services players are launching aggressive national\nmarketing campaigns around their wealth advisory services businesses, and the results are\npaying off as they begin to capture an alarming share of the market in a short period of\ntime. In addition, a new, completely different type of competitor has announced its\npresence and intent to enter the wealth advisory services market, offering a value\nproposition very similar to the client’s. This new concern is well funded, and has some\nof the most successful venture capitalists of the day filling the seats on its board of\ndirectors. This new competitor is also causing significant problems for the client; within\nthe past 3 months, the top five producing partners have left to join this firm, taking their\nclients with them, and leaving the client’s geographic presence in a strategically critical\ngrowth area significantly weakened. In addition, the client is finding that its revenues are\ndecreasing significantly in certain types wealth advisory services they offer.\nThe client has retained the services of Deloitte Consulting to help them understand what\ntheir strategic response options are, and to recommend the best course of action to follow.\nKey Interview Questions\nAssume you have just joined the Deloitte Consulting team for this project and today is\nthe project kick-off meeting. What would be your hypothesis around the root cause of\nthe client’s issues and what information would you want to look at to determine the best\nrecommendation for the client? What information do you need to arrive at your\nhypothesis? What do you feel are the strategic options facing the client?\nPossible Recommendations/Approaches & Key Points/Issues Candidate Should\nCover:\nSuggested framework: 3 C’s approach: company, customer (market) & competition\nUnderstand the Client’s capabilities and position in the marketplace: (value chain\nanalysis)\nHaas Consulting Club Case Book 25\n\nThe company differentiates itself in the wealth advisory market by offering independent\nand objective advice to its clients, recommending only those products and services\nwarranted by the investment strategy and the client’s particular risk profile. The client\ndoes not form formal partnerships or alliances with product suppliers (e.g., investment\nbanks and fund managers).\nThe Client is known worldwide for its expertise in its legacy businesses: corporate tax\npreparation & advisory services, as well as audit services. About 75% of its business is\nin tax preparation and services, the remaining is in wealth advisory services, but both its\nmarket share and the market itself is growing. As tax preparers and auditors,\nindependence and objectivity is not only critical, it is required and monitored by the SEC.\nThe company offers its wealth advisory services using the same model as for tax\npreparation (e.g., fee per hour).\nWhile its position as independent and objective differentiates itself vis-à-vis the product\nplayers, it limits the areas it can control in the value chain:\nplan (cid:1) advise (cid:1) execute (cid:1) reassess and modify\n(determine goals) (develop plan) (based on performance,\nand chgs to risk profile)\nDue to SEC restrictions, the client is not allowed to execute transactions (e.g., the\npurchase of securities, taking custody of funds, etc.); it must advise and recommend only.\nOther players, many of them competitors, such as banks, mutual fund companies,\ninsurance companies, are the ones who are ultimately able to execute. As a result, the\nclient cannot control who develops relationships with their customers. The key part of\nthe value chain to control is link between “advise” and “execute” in that controlling the\nrelationship with the customer is controlling the execution and the quality of the\nexecution, and blocking or limiting the role of these other players who execute services.\nWhile the client offers and sells a vast portfolio of services to its customers, the amount\nof revenues generated from services other than tax preparation and advice has been\ndeclining. (the customer is retreating to purchasing services that the client is branded and\nwell-known for, seeking investment advisory services from better known names (e.g.,\ninvestment banks) who have entered the market and have aggressive marketing\ncampaigns).\nUnderstand Competitive shifts: Which competitors are entering the market?\nDuring the past few years, the number of players entering the wealth advisory services\nspace has grown considerably. Investment banks, mutual fund companies and brokerage\nfirms have all entered this realm, and many are targeting the affluent segment.\nThe New Economy is disrupting this market. In addition to investment banks and private\nbanks entering the market, pure online players such as e*Trade are aligning with\ntraditional high-end banks (e.g., Northern Trust) to offer their affluent clients online\ntrading and account monitoring capability. Finally, a new entrant, myCFO.com is a pure\ninternet play that competes directly with the client in the independent and objective\nadvice category, but does so without being burdened with the restrictions of being a\npublic accounting and audit firm (e.g., they are able to strike alliances, partnerships, and\ncan offer its customers access to invest in venture capital funds).\nHaas Consulting Club Case Book 26\n\nWhy are they entering the market?\nInvestment banks, mutual fund companies and other diversified financial institutions\n(Schwab, AmEx) have heavily invested in IT to support the Internet brokerage and\ntrading business. They are now leveraging their IT capabilities by expanding into wealth\nadvisory services, bolstered by offering online customer accounts, where customers can\naccess their accounts and advisors 24/7. Many are entering into this area because\nmargins for these services are higher than commissions on trades (brokerage fees), which\nare shrinking due to downward pressure brought about by discount online trading options\nsuch as e*Trade. Launch of these premium online customer accounts is being bolstered\nby aggressive national advertising campaigns.\nUnderstand Market (and Customer) shifts:\nThe tremendous wealth creation occurring in the mid to late 90s has created a growing\nnumber of affluent individuals in the United States (“Affluent” = net worth exceeding\n$1M). While the market for wealth advisory services to affluent individuals is growing,\nthe market for independent and objective advice is unclear, because the value placed on\nindependence and objectivity in this space is unclear. Competitors who are clearly not\nobjective (e.g., investment banks and mutual fund companies), are positioning its wealth\nadvisory services as independent and objective. The major question is whether or not the\ncustomer appears to appreciate the difference between a true provider of objective advice,\nand those positioning themselves as “pseudo-objective”. Is this critical, single\ndifferentiating factor that separates our client from its larger, better funded and more IT\nenabled competitors – valued enough to sustain the business?\nEvaluate the Strategic Options available to the client:\nOption 1: Exit the wealth advisory services portion of the business (about 25% of overall\nrevenues, the remainder comes from tax and audit services); Option 2: stay with the\ncurrent strategy of offering objective and independent advice but invest to develop an IT\nplatform to offer an online offering to its clients; Option 3: assess the market for\n“independent and objective advice” (e.g., evaluate whether this attribute is strategically\nsound as the core differentiating attribute).\nCase Wrap-Up\nSTRATEGIC OPTIONS: The Deloitte Consulting Team recommended several options:\n• Exit the business;\n• Stay in the business and invest incrementally to remain competitive (e.g., expand\nexisting practices, bring in more experienced hires);\n• Stay in the business and aggressively invest to develop an IT-based customer channel\n• Spin off the business from the core business of tax and audit and pursue more\naggressive alliance and JV strategies.\nChoosing the option involves addressing the central key issue: what is the market for\nindependent and objective advice? We recommended the client address this issue before\nmaking a decision on the option to pursue:\nDeloitte Consulting recommended that the client initiate a conjoint analysis study to\ndetermine the relative value placed on this attribute vs. cost and other attributes.\nHaas Consulting Club Case Book 27\n\nIn addition, Deloitte Consulting examined how, as a public accounting firm, is it possible\nto exert more control over the execution portion of the value chain.\nDeloitte Consulting recommended that the client initiate a developmental program in\nhouse to mentor and develop client service professionals to become “Most Trusted\nAdvisors” – deepening the relationship with current clients to sell the full scope of wealth\nadvisory services (not just tax services). In doing so, the client became a more customer-\ncentric organization, focusing on serving the specific and evolving needs of its customer\nbase.\nHaas Consulting Club Case Book 28",
  "Berkeley_2006_Technology Product Warehouser": "5.5. Technology Product Warehouser\nLength: Medium (30 Minutes)\nProblem:\nThe client is a warehouser that purchases a range of telephony technologies (simple and\ncomplicated) from original manufacturers, and then sells them to a group of resellers,\nwho in turn sell them to end consumers.\nManufacturer (cid:1) CLIENT (cid:1) Reseller (cid:1) End Consumer\nThe reseller market can be divided into Corporate (largest), Value-Added (medium), and\nE-tailer (smallest) segments. Our client has experienced eight quarters of declining\nprofit. Attempt to answer why and provide recommendations to reverse this trend.\nIf Asked for Market Information:\nThe client is the largest company in the industry, with a number two competitor almost as\nlarge and several smaller players. There have been no new market entrants in recent\nyears and all firms sell at industry-wide prices. The industry can be divided exclusively\ninto three segments, for which the following data exist:\nMarket Client Industry Market Client Industry\n2000 Size Unit Avg. 2002 Size Unit Avg.\n($ MM) Sales ($) Price ($) ($ MM) Sales ($) Price ($)\nCorporate 20 1,000,000 5,000 Corporate 15 1,000,000 3,000\nValue- 45 1,500,000 10,000 Value- 40 1,250,000 8,000\nAdded Added\nE-tailers 10 2,500,000 2,000 E-tailers 5 2,000,000 1,000\nSolution:\nThe calculations from the above table should lead the interviewee to the following\nconclusions:\n• The overall industry has shrunk, both on a price and volume basis (“it’s a bad\nbusiness to be in”)\n• The client’s overall market share has shrunk from roughly 33% to 25%\n• Value-added is the largest segment and client has lost the most market share in it\nThe falling prices can be interpreted to mean that a price war has begun in the industry,\nperhaps due to short-sighted competitive responses to new technologies. The falling\nvolume can be interpreted to mean that the client and its competitors are getting cut out of\nthe value chain, as manufacturers have begun to sell directly to resellers and end\nconsumers.\nBased on the available data, deteriorating metrics across the board suggest that the\nindustry is mature and rapidly approaching obsolescence. Absent novel opportunities for\ndifferentiation, there is little that the client can do to return to profitability under these\nmarket conditions. Recommendations should recognize this reality and likely address\noptions for exiting the industry via diversification, firm sale, and/or closure.\nHaas Consulting Club Case Book 29",
  "Berkeley_2006_Bus Operator": "5.6. Bus Operator\nLength: Short (15 Minutes)\nProblem:\nOur client is a US bus transport operator maintaining routes between cities. The company\nhas lost money for the past several years and over-operated routes as well as recent route\nadditions are suspected to be responsible. A new CEO has now taken charge and\ndetermined that the company needs to aggressively cut costs in order to return to\nprofitability. How would you approach the problem?\nInformation To Be Provided If Requested:\n1. Routes are of three types: short, medium or long. More than half of the revenue\ncomes from long distance trips\n2. The company has a substantial real estate investment in terminals\n3. The prior CEO focused on top line; instituted plans like anywhere pickup\n4. Cash position is tight – the company had a recent brush with bankruptcy\n5. Its equipment is quite old\n6. The largest cost for a bus company is fuel\nSolution:\nThe candidate is expected to use a profitability framework, and focus more on costs than\nother aspects because of the nature of the problem.\nCosts can be divided into Fixed and Variable Costs.\nFixed Costs: Buses, stations and other buildings, salaried employees, etc.\nVariable Costs: Gas, hourly employees, maintenance (debatable whether variable)\nCosts could be cut on possibly all of the above areas. Here are some specific suggestions:\n• Determine which routes are profitable and cut back on the unprofitable routes – a\ngood metric to use would be the load factor\n• Change routes in a way that can improve the load factor\n• Think about oil contracts to protect against oil price fluctuations\n• Lease new equip. to decrease maintenance costs, downtime, and fuel efficiency\n• Reconsider “anywhere pickup” and utilize more freeways to improve schedules\nand utilization of equipment (bonus point)\nThe other part of cost cutting would be to compare the services provided to customers\nwith what they really want. For example, there may be costs involved with extra terminal\nservices or increasing leg room on new seats that are not valued by consumers.\nEssentially, the offering must be realigned with customer needs.\nFollow-Up Question: If the company figures out 25 new routes that may be profitable,\nhow one would go about starting service on those routes.\nPossible Response to Follow-Up Question:\nThe company would need to look at the operating costs per route, competition on each\nroute, whether the company’s infrastructure could support the new routes, and what\npotential customers on these routes want (they are likely not riders on the company’s\nexisting routes.)\nHaas Consulting Club Case Book 30",
  "Berkeley_2006_Apparel Retailer": "5.7. Apparel Retailer\nLength: Medium (30 Minutes)\nProblem Statement:\nYour client is a premium brand apparel retailer. In recent years it has noticed a consistent\ndecrease in market share. How would you structure your analysis?\nInformation To Be Provided If Requested:\nIndustry and Market Share:\n• Market share has fallen from 15% to 7%\n• Competitors consist of premium retailers in the same business segment. There is\ngrowing competition from substitutes and mid-range brands as well\n• The market size has been growing steadily\n• There have been no recent major consolidations in the industry\nMarketing, Sales, and Distribution:\n• There have been no substantial changes in the company’s marketing mix or\ndistribution\n• Prices have remained constant\n• Competitor marketing / pricing / product mix has remained unchanged\n• Distribution is primarily through large retail outlets that stock multiple products\n(70%). The balance (30%) is distributed through self-owned outlets and smaller\nmerchants\n• Distributors have recently launched their own premium product brands\n• Currently there is no online sales channel\nCost: No recent changes in cost structure or profit margins\nCustomers\n• Customers are not price sensitive\n• Customer recognition of the company’s brand is low\nSolution:\nThe company is not diversified enough in terms of its distribution channels. The\ncompany’s principal distribution channel has launched its own set of products in direct\ncompetition with our client’s products. The distributor has control over shelf space and\nearns a higher margin on its own products than by selling our clients’ products. Thus it\nhas been pushing sales of its own products at the cost of our client’s products. To\ncounteract this, our client must consider diversifying its distribution channel. Possible\noptions include:\n• More self-owned stores\n• Creation of an online store\nIn each case, the client must consider the possible impacts of these new channels on the\ncompany’s brand. In addition, the company must work to strengthen customer pull\nthrough a significant branding program. This would encourage customers to demand\nclient products through both old and new distribution channels.\nHaas Consulting Club Case Book 31",
  "Berkeley_2006_Toothbrush Wars": "5.8. Toothbrush Wars\nLength: Medium (30 Minutes)\nProblem:\nYour client is the division of a global consumer products company that produces\ntoothbrushes. Its product portfolio consists primarily of a “manual” toothbrush that\nretails for $3 and an electric “rechargeable” toothbrush that retails for $50. One year ago,\na new competitor introduced a battery-powered electric “spinbrush” that retails for $5 and\nnow controls 1% of the worldwide toothbrush market. Your client currently lacks a\ncomparable offering and would like to know whether it should develop a similar product.\nHint: (to be provided only if interviewee struggles significantly with the initial\nstructuring of the problem)\nThe client typically views the market in terms of margins and “per customer per year”\nmetrics.\nInformation To Be Provided If Specifically Requested:\nOne year ago, the worldwide market was made up of 80% manual and 20% rechargeable\ntoothbrushes. The spinbrush’s 1% market share gain has come mostly at the expense of\nrechargeable toothbrush sales.\nManual:\n• The client’s net profit margin on sales of manual toothbrushes is 66%\n• The average manual toothbrush user goes through 4 toothbrushes per year\n• On average, 2 toothbrushes per year are given to manual toothbrush users free of charge by their dentists\nRechargeable:\n• Rechargeable toothbrushes are sold as two separate components: a “base” that retails for $50 (with a\n60% net profit margin) and an associated “head” that retails for $5 (with a 90% net profit margin)\n• 1 base and 1 head are needed at all times for the device to work; no other components are compatible\n• The average base last 10 years\n• The average rechargeable toothbrush user goes through 2 heads per year and purchases bases as needed\nSpinbrush:\n• No specific cost data is known for the competitor’s spinbrush offering\n• Client product development believes it could produce a spinbrush “knockoff” at a cost of $3 per brush\nAnalysis:\nThe most effective approach should begin by calculating figures in terms of profit per\ncustomer per year.\nManual:\n[2 toothbrushes purchased] x [$3 retail] x [66% profit margin] = [$4 profit per customer\nper year]\nRechargeable:\nHaas Consulting Club Case Book 32\n\n([2 heads purchased] x [$5 retail] x [90% profit margin]) + ([1/10 base] x [50 retail] x\n[60% profit margin])\n= [$12 profit per customer per year]\nSpinbrush:\nAssuming production costs would be the same for the client and its competitor:\n[2 toothbrushes purchased] x ([$5 retail] – [$3 cost of production]) = [$4 profit per\ncustomer per year]\nSolution:\nAt this point the analysis becomes more qualitative in nature. While the manual and\nspinbrush products are similar in terms of profitability, the manual toothbrush addresses\nthe mass market (80% market share at a $3 retail price point) and is unlikely to lose share\nto the spinbrush. However, the rechargeable segment is most profitable for the client and\nis clearly threatened by the introduction of the spinbrush. If the client were to respond\nwith a “knockoff” spinbrush, it would likely hasten the demise of its profitable\noperations. Therefore, the client should consider alternative means to respond to the\nspinbrush “disruptive technology”.\nHaas Consulting Club Case Book 33",
  "Berkeley_2006_Newspaper Start-Up": "5.9. Newspaper Start-Up\nLength: Short (15 Minutes)\nProblem:\nAs an established consultant with McKinsey, you have volunteered your time to critique\nbusiness plans at a local entrepreneur’s forum. One plan calls for establishing door-to-\ndoor distribution of an already existing online newspaper in Cologne, the fourth-largest\ncity in Germany. Without detailed knowledge of how the process would work in\npractice, how might you evaluate the feasibility of the proposed distribution plan?\nInformation To Be Provided If Requested:\nNo external capital has been provided, and resources only allow for the hiring of 6\nnewspaper carriers on bicycles, each of whom will be responsible for one square\nkilometer within the downtown area of the city.\nYou should use simplifying assumption that the city is in the shape of a square and the\npopulation is evenly distributed in homes that are an equal distance apart from each other.\nAlso ignore non-residential areas and assume no “stacking” of homes.\nThe newspaper is scheduled to be printed and ready for distribution by 4AM each\nmorning, and must be delivered by 6AM to meet customer requirements.\n* Key assumption the interviewee must make (reorient them if they assume something far\nfrom this figure): subscriber homes within the proposed distribution area are on average\n10 meters apart from each other.\nAnalysis:\nOne way to assess the feasibility of the plan is to calculate how quickly the newspaper\ncarrier must deliver a single newspaper, and evaluate whether that sounds like a\nreasonable figure.\nIf the interviewee has difficulty conceptualizing the problem, sketch a rough estimation\nof this graph to guide his/her thinking:\n• • • • • • • • • •\n• • • • • • • • • •\n• • • • • • • • • •\n• • • • • • • • • •\n• • • • • • • • • •\n• • • • • • • • • •\n• • • • • • • • • •\n• • • • • • • • • •\n• • • • • • • • • •\nHaas Consulting Club Case Book 34\n...\n• • • • • • • • • ...\n100\n\nBy assuming that homes are 10 meters apart from each other on average, each side of the\nsquare must contain 100 homes ([1,000 meters] / [10 meters between each home]).\nTherefore, a square kilometer contains 10,000 “stops” for the newspaper carrier ([100\n“stops” per row] x [100 rows of homes]. Given only 7,200 seconds to complete the job\n([2 hours] x [60 minutes per hour] x [60 seconds per minute]), the newspaper carrier\nwould need to deliver more than one newspaper per second, which is likely impossible.\nSolution:\nDue to the budget constraints of the business plan, hiring more newspaper carriers is not a\nvalid option. Two potential solutions include the following:\n1) Reduce distribution area – Pare back distribution to reach only the most profitable\npotential subscribers\n2) Change distribution method – Co-distribute with other publications and/or locate\nalternative channels\nHaas Consulting Club Case Book 35",

What went wrong and what should the\ncompany do to prevent this in the future?\nInformation To Be Provided If Requested:\nThe “music industry supply chain” can be structured as follows:\nArtists & Content (cid:1) Physical Production (cid:1) Distribution (cid:1) Retailers\nTime, communication, and transportation costs must be factored into each “handoff” in the supply chain.\nSupply chain phase descriptions:\n• Artists & Content: Typically the longest phase, with a wide range of variability in length\n• Physical Production: Typically the shortest phase, often a few seconds, managed in-house by the client\n• Distribution: Storage and transportation via distribution centers between manufacture and retail locations\n• Retailers: Store shelves, hot-selling items have lead times that are short, but not unreasonable\nSupply chain relations:\n• Artists & Content: No standard operating procedures in place to deal with music content providers\n• Physical Production: In-house\n• Distribution: Good relations and variability management mechanisms with 150-200 distributor network\n• Retailers: Strong relations, good communications, and information sharing with end retailers\nArtists & Content Process Detail (if requested):\n• Content relationships are often contractual arrangements with recording studios and independent artists\n• There are no guidelines to manage “the creative process”, which rarely conforms to set timetables\n• There are no standardized decision-making procedures for how and when contacts come up for review\n• The above factors contribute to the extremely high rate of variability in this phase of the supply chain\nAnalysis:\nDetailed probing of the “music industry supply chain” should reveal bottlenecks in the\nArtist & Content phase and resulting handoff, even when the rest of process is generally\nmarked by best-in-class procedures. The interviewee should demonstrate understanding\nthat high process variability and front end delays can lead to supply chain disruptions and\nultimately product stockouts. These factors are particularly likely to cause problems\nduring periods of high demand, such as the retail holiday season. A detailed supply chain\nmanagement process needs to address the unusual circumstances and variability of “the\ncreative process.”\nHaas Consulting Club Case Book 36",
  "Berkeley_2006_Test Equipment Manufacturer": "5.11. Test Equipment Manufacturer\nLength: Long (30-45 Minutes)\nProblem:\nYour client is a manufacturer of test equipment for electronics companies. This is a high\ncomplexity, low volume business, where products range from $10,000 to $1 million.\nProducts are built from sets of standard subassemblies, which the manufacturer holds in\nstock. When customers order a product, the Sales department determines customer\nrequirements and configures the product using these subassemblies.\nCurrently, the client holds 183 days worth of inventory on average. Best-in-class\ncompanies hold 39 days. The client would like you to help reduce inventories to 85 days\nor less. How would you go about achieving this?\nGuidelines for Building the Supply Chain:\nThe candidate should begin by trying to understand the supply chain. The following\ninformation can be provided as the candidate works through the supply chain model:\n1. After the order is received, the client assembles the product out of subassemblies\nand base units\n2. Subassemblies are essentially circuit boards, which are designed by the client.\nManufacturing of these circuit boards is outsourced, with a cycle time of\napproximately 1-2 weeks\n3. Components used to manufacture subassemblies are purchased and maintained by\nthe client, and sent to the outsourced manufacturer for assembly. These\ncomponents fall in two categories of approximately equal dollar value:\na. A large number of “standard” off-the-shelf components are purchased\nfrom distributors as needed. Lead times for standard components are\napproximately 1-2 weeks\nb. A smaller number of “custom” components are designed by the client and\nmanufactured in low volumes by large semiconductor manufacturers.\nLead times for custom components are approximately 9 months, with little\nopportunity for improvement\n4. For a typical subassembly, 33% of the cost is made up of standard components,\n33% of the cost is made up of custom components, and 33% of the cost is\nassembly at the outsourced location\nAdditional Information:\n1. The client currently guarantees 4 weeks delivery time to the customers upon order\nreceipt\n2. Inventory is comprised mainly of base units (little dollar value) and subassemblies\n(high dollar value). Although there are only a few base units in the final offering,\nthe total number of product configurations with different features and\nsubassemblies is as high as 26,000\n3. Some subassemblies move very fast, while some others move slowly, and\noccasionally have to be scrapped because a new version of the product is offered\nHaas Consulting Club Case Book 37\n\nSolution:\nThere is no “aha” to this case, however, the candidate is to be tested on developing an\nunderstanding of the supply chain, and asking the right questions to extract all the above\ninformation. A few key points:\n• Has the client looked into reducing the number of subassemblies? One way to do\nthis could be making subassemblies that do a large set of functions, but enabling\nonly a smaller set requested and paid for by the customer. This would allow for\npooling of the demand and reduce its variation, which would in turn lead to lower\ninventories\n• Standard components can be procured by the outsourced manufacturer if they\nhave demand for these components for their other customers. This would reduce\nthe inventory being carried by the client, again because of pooling\n• Given that the client promises 4-week delivery, it might be possible to hold\ninventory in raw components rather than subassemblies and have it manufactured\non demand. If feasible, this could reduce the cost of inventory by one third\nHaas Consulting Club Case Book 38",
  "Berkeley_2006_Disaster Remediation": "5.12. Disaster Remediation\nLength: Medium (30 Minutes)\nProblem:\nYour client is a US-based provider of fire and water remediation services, which\nprimarily provide extensive cleaning in the aftermath of damages related to burning and\nflooding. The company is typically hired by insurance companies on behalf of\nconsumers and businesses. While this existing business is quite profitable, your client\nhas asked for counsel on whether to enter the US residential cleaning market (traditional\nhousecleaning, which typically takes place 2-4 times per month.)\nPre-Case (Market Sizing Exercise):\nHow would you go about estimating the size of the residential cleaning market?\nPotential Answer to Pre-Case:\n• The population of the United States is roughly 300 million people, or about 100 million households\n• These households can be roughly split in half according to whether they earn more than $75,000 per year\n• Estimate the willingness to pay for housecleaning services at 40% of households making more than\n$75,000 per year and 10% of households making less than $75,000 per year (interviewer to confirm)\n• [50 million households] x [40%] + [50 million households] x [10%] = [25 million purchases per year]\n• Assumed annual housecleaning fees of $2,000 (interviewer to confirm) = market size of $50 billion\nInformation To Be Provided If Requested:\nThe US market for housecleaning services is roughly $50 billion (see pre-case), with\nstable growth of 4%.\nCompetition:\n• National Players (10% of market) – Includes national housecleaning companies such as “Dial-A-Maid”\n• Regional Players (20% of market) – Includes regional services such as “Joe’s Chicago Cleaning Service”\n• Individuals (60-70% of market) – Includes individuals who are often not part of a formal organization\nCustomers:\n• Customer purchase criteria generally range along a spectrum with “price” and “quality” on each end\n• Buyers from National Players typically rate “quality” as most important, buyers from Individuals\ntypically rate “price” as most important, and buyers from Regional Players consider a mix of both\nProfitability:\n• The average price for a 5-hour housecleaning job is $75 (based on data from National Players)\n• Client labor costs are roughly $10 per hour and one job consumes roughly $5 worth of cleaning supplies\nSynergy Considerations:\n• While significantly “lower impact”, the household cleaning process is similar to the remediation process\n• The client could leverage its client contacts and customer service ratings in the cleaning market\n• However, the sales process for cleaning services is quite different (no sales via insurance companies)\nSolution:\nThe US market for housecleaning services is large and attractive, and the client has\ntransferable skills, client contacts, and customer service capabilities that would facilitate\na relatively smooth market entry.\nHaas Consulting Club Case Book 39\n\nA preliminary margin analysis suggests that the client could operate profitably against the\nNational Players for the quality-conscious customer segment:\n([$75 price] – [5 hours x $10 hourly labor costs] – [$5 cleaning costs]) / [$75 price] =\n27% profit margin\nDespite these favorable indications, the client will need to develop a tailored value\nproposition to quality-conscious customers and anticipate likely competitor reactions\nbefore proceeding with full market entry.\nHaas Consulting Club Case Book 40",
  "Berkeley_2006_Bicycle Manufacturer": "5.13. Bicycle Manufacturer\nLength: Long (45 Minutes)\nProblem:\n• Your client is a manufacturer of bicycles\n• They have been in business for 25 years\n• They manufacturer and sell three categories of bicycles:\no Racing bikes: High end, high performance bikes for sophisticated cyclists\no Mainstream bikes: Durable, but not overly complicated bikes for everyday\nriders\no Children’s bikes: Smaller, simpler versions of their mainstream bikes for\nchildren\n• Profits at your client have decreased over the past five years\nQuestion:\n• What is driving the decline in overall profits?\n• What recommendations might correct the situation?\nAnalysis:\nThe first question is to determine what has caused overall profits to decrease. To\naccomplish this, the candidate must first understand what has transpired in each of the\nthree product categories over the past five years during which profitability has slipped.\nThe following are questions and answers that would be provided in an interview scenario.\n• What are the client’s margins for a bicycle in each of the three segments?\no Racing: Cost = $600/unit, Profit=$300/unit\no Mainstream: Cost = $250/unit, Profit = $75/unit\no Children’s: Cost = $ 200/unit, Profit = $50/unit\n• What has happened to the market size of each of the three segments over the past five\nyears?\no Racing: Has remained constant at its present size of $300MM\no Mainstream: Has increased at 2% growth rate per year to its present size of\n$1.0B\no Children’s: Has increased at 3% growth rate per year to its present size of\n$400MM\n• What has happened to our client’s market share in each of these segments?\no Racing: Market share has decreased from 60% to 30%\no Mainstream: Market share has increased from 0% to 5%\no Children’s: Market share has increased from 0% to 3%\n• Who are the client’s major competitor’s in each market segment? What has happened\nto their market share in each segment over the past five years?\no Racing: There is one main competitor and a host of small firms. Your main\ncompetitor has increased market share from 30% to 50%\nHaas Consulting Club Case Book 41\n\no Mainstream: There exist many, large competitors, none of which holds more\nthan 10% of the market\no Children’s: As in the mainstream segment, there are many competitors, none\nwith more than 10% of the market\nThe above information provides enough information to put together a picture of why\nprofits have decreased over the past five years : Your client, with a commanding position\nin a flat market segment (racing), expanded into new segments (mainstream and\nchildren’s). As this occurred, market share decreased dramatically in the most lucrative\nsegment (racing), creating an unfavorable mix.\nThe extent to which profits have decreased can be deduced from some quick math :\nprofits have slipped from $60MM five years ago (=60% x $300MM x 33% racing\nmargin) to $44MM today ( = (30% x $300MM x 33% racing margin) + (5% x $1B x\n23% mainstream margin) + (3% x $400MM x 20% children’s margin)).\nThe dramatic decrease in market share in the racing segment is at this point still\nunexplained. Questions that would help formulate an explanation include:\n• Have there been any major changes in product quality in your client’s racing product?\nOr in its main competitor’s racing product?\no No\n• Have there been any major price changes in your client’s racing product? Or in its\nmain competitor’s racing product?\no No\n• Have there been any major changes in distribution outlets for your client’s racing\nproduct? Or for its main competitor’s racing product?\no Yes\no Previously your client and its main competitor in the racing segment sold\nexclusively through small, specialty dealers. This remains unchanged for the\ncompetition.\no Your client, however, began to sell its racing bikes through mass distributors\nand discount stores (the distribution outlets for mainstream and children’s\nbikes) as it entered the mainstream and children’s segment.\n• How do the mass distributors and discount stores price the racing bikes relative to the\nspecialty stores?\no Prices at these stores tend to be 15 to 20% less.\n• What percent of your client’s racing sales occur in mass distributors and discount\nstores?\no Effectively none. This attempt to sell through these distributors has failed\n• How has the decision to sell through mass distributor’s and discount stores affected\nthe image of the client’s racing product?\nHaas Consulting Club Case Book 42\n\no No studies have been done.\n• How has the decision to sell through mass distributor’s and discount stores affected\nyour client’s relationship with the specialty outlets?\no Again, no formal analysis has been performed.\nAlthough some analysis and/or survey should be performed to answer more conclusively\nthe last two questions, a possible story can be put together. There has been no appreciable\nchange in either quality or price (or any other tangible factor) of your client’s racing\nproduct relative to its competition. It is not the product that is the problem, but rather its\nimage. As your client came out with lower end, mainstream, and children’s products and\nbegan to push their racing segment through mass distributors and discount outlets, their\nreputation was compromised. Additionally, the presence of the racing products in the\ndiscount outlets has put your historic racing distributor (the specialty shops) in a\nprecarious position. The specialty shops must now lower price to compete, thereby\ncutting their own profits. Instead, they are likely to push the competition’s product.\nRemember, your client has no direct sales force at the retail outlets. The specialty shops\nessentially serve as your client’s sales force.\nThe above analysis offers an explanation of what has affected the top side of the\nprofitability problem. Still to be examined is the cost, or bottom side, of the profitability\nissue. Questions to uncover cost issues would include:\n• How does the client account for its costs?\no The client has a single manufacturing and assembly plant. They have separate\nlines in this facility to produce racing, mainstream and children’s products.\nThey divide their costs into the following categories: labor, material and\noverhead. Overall costs have been increasing at a fairly hefty rate of 10% per\nyear.\n• What is the current breakdown of costs along these categories for each product\nsegment?\no Racing: Labor = 30%, Material = 40%, Overhead = 30%\no Mainstream: Labor = 25%, Material = 40%, Overhead = 35%\no Children’s: Labor = 25%, Material = 40%, Overhead = 35%\n• How has this mix of expenses changed over the past five years?\no In all segments, labor is an increasing percentage of the costs.\n• Does the basic approach to manufacturing (i.e. the mix of labor and technology)\nreflect that of its competition?\no Your client tells you that there is a continuing movement to automate and\nutilize technology to improve efficiency throughout the industry, but it is\nhis/her opinion that their approach, maintaining the “human touch”, is what\ndifferentiates them from the competition. (Unfortunately, he’s right!!)\nHaas Consulting Club Case Book 43\n\n• Is the workforce unionized?\no Yes\n• What is the average age of the workforce?\no 52 and climbing. There is very little turnover in the workforce.\n• What is the present throughput rating? How has it changed over the past five years?\no Presently the plant is producing at about 80% of capacity. This has been\ndecreasing steadily over the last several years.\n• What is the typical reason for equipment shutdown?\no Emergency repair\n• Describe the preventive maintenance program in effect at the client’s facility?\no Preventive maintenance is performed informally based on the knowledge of\nsenior technicians.\n• How often has equipment been replaced? Is this consistent with the original\nequipment manufacturer’s recommendations?\no The client feels that most OEM recommendations are very conservative. They\nhave followed a philosophy of maximizing the life of their equipment and\nhave generally doubled OEM recommendations.\nThe above information is sufficient to add some understanding to the cost side of the\nequation. Your client has an aging workforce and plant that is behind the times in terms\nof technology and innovation. This has contributed to excessive breakdowns, decreased\nthroughput, increased labor rates (wages increase with seniority) and greater labor hours\n(overtime to fix broken machines).\nIn proposing recommendations to improve the client’s situation, there is no single correct\napproach. There are a number of approaches that might be explored and recommended.\nThe following are some possibilities:\n• Abandon the mainstream and children’s segment to recover leadership in the racing\nsegment\nIssues to consider in this approach:\no How much of the racing segment is “recoverable”?\no What are the expected growth rates of each segment?\no How badly damaged is the relationship with the specialty outlets?\no Are there alternative outlets to the specialty shops such as internet sales?\no How will this move affect overall utilization of the operating facilities?\n• Maintain the mainstream and children’s segment, but sell under a different name\nIssues to consider in this approach:\no Is there demand among the mass and discount distributors for bicycles under\ntheir name?\nHaas Consulting Club Case Book 44\n\no What additional advertising and promotions costs might be incurred?\no What are the expected growth rates of each segment?\no What is driving the buying habits of the mainstream and children’s market?\n• Reduce costs through automation and innovation\nIssues to be considered:\no What technological improvements are to be made?\no What are the required investments?\no What are the expected returns on those investments?\no How will these investments affect throughput?\no To which lines are these investments appropriate?\no Are the mainstream and children’s segments potentially “over-engineered”?\no What impact will this have on the required workforce levels?\no If layoffs are required to achieve the benefits, what impact will this have on\nlabor relations?\n• Reduce costs through establishing a formal preventive maintenance program\nIssues to be considered:\no What organizational changes will be required?\no What analysis will be performed to determine the appropriate amount of PM?\no What training is required of the workforce?\no What technical or system changes are required?\no How will the unionized workforce respond?\nKey Takeaways:\nThis case can prove to be lengthy and very involved. It is not expected that a candidate\nwould cover all of the above topics, but rather work through selected topics in a logical\nfashion. It is important that the candidate pursue a solution that considers both revenue\nand cost issues to impact profit. Additionally, a candidate’s ability to work comfortably\nwith the quantitative side of this case is important. The above recommendations for\nimproving profitability are just a few among many. The candidate may come with\nhis/her own ideas.\nHaas Consulting Club Case Book 45",
  "Berkeley_2006_Private-Label Cookies": "5.14. Private-Label Cookies\nLength: Long (45 Minutes)\nProblem:\n• Your client is a US-based manufacturer of branded cookies (cookies that carry the\nname of the manufacturer)\n• Recently private label cookies (those carrying the name of the retailer) have emerged\nand threatened branded cookies\n• Private label cookies emerged five years ago\n• Two and one-half years ago they made up 10% of the overall cookie market (brand\nbeing the other 90%)\n• Today they make up approximately 20% of the overall cookie market (i.e., there has\nbeen a steady, linear increase of private label portion of the overall cookie market\nduring the past five years)\n• The overall cookie market has been relatively flat over the past five years\n• Private label cookies are made by the same manufacturers who make branded cookies,\nthey are just sold under the name of the retailer\n• There are essentially three major competitors to consider:\no Your client, who makes only branded cookies\no A second major player, that makes both branded cookies and supplies cookies\nfor private labelers\no A collection of small outfits, that make both branded cookies and supply\nprivate labelers\n• Distribution occurs primarily through one of two types of outlets:\n• Grocery outlets: all grocers sell branded cookies, most also carry their own private\nlabel cookies. This represents approximately 90% of total cookie sales\n• Mass merchandisers (ex. Walmart, Sam’s, etc.): sell only branded cookies\nQuestion:\n• How large would you estimate the overall U.S. cookie market to be in terms of $?\n• How large of a threat do you believe the trend in private label cookie sales to be to\nyour client?\n• Based on your assessment, what is an appropriate strategy for your client to follow?\nSolution:\nThe first question, estimating the size of the U.S. cookie market, has no right or wrong\nanswer. It is a test of a candidate’s ability to make reasonable assumptions and work\nquickly with numbers on an “order of magnitude” level. One acceptable response would\nbe to estimate the number of U.S. households, estimate household consumption over\nsome period of time, estimate the average cost of a bag of cookies, and project out for\none year. In this case, after an estimate has been made, the candidate would be told to\nassume the market size is $1Billion to simplify any future calculations. As stated in the\nupfront information, the market is assumed to have been flat for the past five years.\nHaas Consulting Club Case Book 46\n\nThe second question is more involved. It involves determining to what extent your client\nis threatened by the increasing percent of the overall cookie market represented by\nprivate label sales. To better answer this question information should be gathered\npertaining to what is driving the demand for private label cookies, to what extent this has\nalready affected your client’s sales, and what the likelihood is for the trend to continue.\nThe following are questions and answers that would be provided in an interview scenario.\nWhat are the sales trends for the client over the past five years?\nYour client’s sales have been flat at $600M for the time frame of five to two and one-half\nyears ago. Over the past two and one-half years, sales have decreased steadily down to a\npresent level of $560MM.\nHow has market share of the private label segment been split over the past five years\nbetween your client’s main competitor and the other smaller players?\nThe smaller players combined had 100% of the private label sub segment five years ago.\nTwo and one-half years ago your client’s main competitor began supplying private\nlabelers. Today, this main competitor owns 40% of the private label sub segment, the\nsmaller players own the remaining 60%\nHow has market share of the branded segment been split over the past five years?\nYour client held 60% of this segment five years ago, 67% two and one-half years ago and\n70% today. Its main competitor held 30% five years ago, 25% two and one-half years ago\nand 23% today. The combined smaller players owned 10% five years ago, 8% two and\none-half years ago and 7% today.\nAnalysis of the above information tells a very important story. The private label segment\nwas launched five years ago by the smaller players. As private label first cut into the\nbranded segment, it came at the expense of your client’s main competitor and the smaller\nplayers, not your client. In response to this, your client’s main competitor entered into the\nprivate label segment two and one-half years ago. This further hurt their own sales and\nthose of the smaller players, but also began to hurt your client’s sales. Additional\ninformation is required to understand what is driving the demand for private label cookies\nHow does the quality of a private label cookie compare to that of a branded cookie?\nConsumer studies have shown that there is a noticeable difference in taste, texture and\nquality in favor of the branded cookies\nAt the manufacturing level, what is the difference in cost of production and price between\nbranded and private label products?\nIt costs approximately $1.50 to manufacture a bag of private label cookies which will sell\nfor $2.00 to retailers. It costs approximately $2.00 to manufacture a bag of branded\ncookies which will sell for $2.75.\nHow do the same numbers translate at the retail level?\nA retailer, paying $2.00 for private label cookies can sell that product for $2.50. The\n$2.75 bag of branded cookies can be sold for $3.50.\nHaas Consulting Club Case Book 47\n\nThe key finding is that from a cost-price-margin perspective it is advantageous for both\nthe manufacturers and the retailers, with all else equal, to sell a bag of branded cookies.\nOther factors must be contributing to the demand for private label cookies. Think about\nthe incentives at each level in the chain (manufacturer, retailer, consumer). The following\nquestions can help fill in details\nHave any of the manufacturers been able to gain additional shelf space for branded\nproducts by supplying grocers with private label products?\nNo\nHas their been excess capacity at your client, its main competitor or the smaller\ncompetitors that has been used up through the manufacturing of private label products?\nThere was some excess capacity at the smaller competitors and your client’s main\ncompetitor (your client is unsure as to how much).. There is little excess capacity\nanywhere in the industry today.\n.\nHas your client’s relationship with its retailers suffered as a result of it not supplying\nprivate label products?\nNot noticeably\nAre grocery stores using private labels in other food categories?\nYes, there has been a major push by grocery stores to populate shelves with private labels\nIs competition increasing or decreasing among grocers?\nGenerally increasing. Grocer chains are expanding and the number of grocers to be found\nserving a given area has generally increased over the past five years\nWhat general macroeconomic trends have occurred over the past five years?\nThe economy has been slowing over the past five years. There is concern about recession\nThe above information begins to expose a clearer story. A number of factors have\ncontributed to the emergence of the private label segment: manufacturer’s interest in\nutilizing excess capacity, grocer’s desire to sell products with their name on it (they may\nbelieve this creates return customers in an increasing competitive environment),\nconsumers concerns about a troubled economy (price vs. quality tradeoffs).\nAt this point the candidate would be encouraged to state what they believe the magnitude\nof the private label threat to be to the client. There is no right answer. One can argue\neither way.\nIf the threat is seen as high, the likely recommendation is for your client to begin\nsupplying private label products. The candidate should recognize that in competing in the\nprivate label segment, the basis of competition is primarily cost. At the same time, the\nclient’s branded product should be protected. The following tactics might prove\nappropriate:\nHaas Consulting Club Case Book 48\n\n• Seek to wring costs out of all phases of the operation\n• Utilize all existing excess capacity\n• Gain maximum product knowledge as quickly as possible\n• Understand low cost positions on product ingredients and mix\n• Review process improvement/ manufacturing efficiency opportunities\n• Undertake overhead reduction efforts (Any of these points could be discussed in great\ndetail)\n• Ensure there is no customer confusion between private label offering and branded\nproduct\n• Seek partnering agreements with retailers\n• Joint advertising and promotions\n• Explore deals with mass merchandisers to enter private labels (remember, mass\nmerchandisers presently sell no private label)\nIf the threat is seen as low, the likely recommendation is for your client to stay with\nbranded cookies only. The candidate should recognize that in competing in the branded\nsegment the basis of competition is one of differentiation. Additionally, your client\nshould do all it can to halt or reverse the momentum of the private label segment. The\nfollowing tactics might prove useful:\n• Pursue a maximum differentiation strategy\n• Invest in brand image to support premium price\n• Make it difficult to copy product: innovate wisely through product advances, smart\nproduct line extensions, frequent changes to the product\n• Manage price gap: explore price increases where appropriate (Again, any of these\npoints could be discussed in great detail)\n• Explore exclusive partnering with mass merchandisers\n• Consider alternative distribution channels\n• Seek partnering agreements with grocers regarding branded products\n• Educate grocers as available\n• Customers who buy private labels are the most price sensitive. They also tend to be\nthe least loyal customers and spend less per store visit.\n• Grocers’ financial stake in private label products extends beyond the product margins.\nThere is lost profit from branded products that could occupy the same shelf space,\nadvertising costs of the private label products, etc.\nKey Takeaways:\nThis case has no right or wrong answer. It forces the candidate to take a stand in a “grey”\nsituation and defend it. It also provides a large amount of data upfront which the\ncandidate must quickly sort through and determine what is important and what is not. The\nkey is to understand the story behind the data. How did the private label segment emerge?\nWhat is driving it? How has it affected manufacturers, retailers and consumers?\nHaas Consulting Club Case Book 49",
  "Berkeley_2006_Water Utility Company": "5.15. Water Utility Company\nLength: Medium (30 Minutes)\nProblem:\nYour client is a German owned water utility that is headquartered in the Northeast United\nStates. The water utility serves the majority of the northeast area and is the exclusive\nprovider or water in the region. Internally, the client measures its performance using a\nversion of the EVA (economic value added) financial valuation technique. This\ntechnique emphasizes the corporate return as a function of profits and a capital charge\n(essentially the return that capital assets produce). The EVA function can be written as:\nEVA = Net Operating Profits – (WACC*Capital Asset Base); which essentially is “un-\nlevered” operating income (after tax) less the fair return on invested capital.\nCurrently the client is operating at a negative EVA level. How would you go about\ngetting EVA to the value of zero and eventually turning it positive? What are the various\nideas you would explore:\nSolution:\nWhen I first got this case, I was only vaguely familiar with EVA based on some work in\ncorporate finance, and I made sure to ask a couple of questions about the formula to\nensure I understood it. It was not critical to the case to be an EVA expert, but you needed\nto understand what the equation was saying. The key part was recognizing that the\nweight of the equation resides with the first term (meaning Operating Profits have a\nlarger effect on EVA because the other component of the equation is the WACC (a\npercentage figure multiplied by the capital assets of the firm). A candidate should come\nto this conclusion on his/her own. If not, then the interviewer should point it out if the\ncandidate struggles.\nOnce you understand that Operating Profits drive a large portion of EVA, you need to\nexplore what effects operating profits, but don’t completely ignore the capital asset base\nas you want to be comprehensive in your analysis. A good place to start would be\nexploring top line revenue implications, and then to explore the cost elements (or vice\nversa). The candidate should also explore what assets are driving the capital asset base.\nLastly, a solid candidate cannot ignore regulatory issues in this case, and should mention\nthem in the course of the discussion.\nThe case had no real answer per say, but was more about exhaustively testing ideas. A\ngood interviewer should be creative in challenging the candidate to go in multiple\ndirections beyond the information provided below.\nInformation To Be Provided If Requested:\n• Revenues have been relatively flat over the past 12 to 18 months. Majority of\nrevenue comes from residential and commercial water usage (billed on a\nconsumption basis per month)\nHaas Consulting Club Case Book 50\n\n• Pricing is based on usage, and is not really capable of being altered significantly\ndue to regulations\n• There have not been significant changes to the capital base, which is primarily\nmade up of machinery and equipment for water filtration and delivery\n• Costs have been relatively stable on the whole.\n• The water utility has the capacity to serve more customers\nEssentially, what you have is a situation where the company needs to grow to increase its\nrevenue base. An ability to add additional customers would be a good idea, as the\ncompany effectively has additional capacity. The candidate should explore potential\ngrowth scenarios and should rebound when he/she hits a dead end. Some potential\ngrowth ideas might include:\n• What about providing bottled water (e.g. a different channel?)\no Good idea, but likely difficult to implement without incurring additional\ncosts for distribution, packaging, branding, etc\n• What about expanding into other regions?\no Possible barriers could be regulatory concerns and other competitors\no Past history dictates local people and businesses are not supportive of\nexpansion by this company\n(cid:2) Candidate should ask why?\n(cid:2) Recall it is a German company, and there has been a bit of resentment\non the socio-political front for this company to expand based on its\nhistory of acquiring other local US companies in the past.\n• Based on past history, merging with another entity and dropping the German\nname might be a good idea\nHaas Consulting Club Case Book 51",
  "Berkeley_2006_Airline Company": "5.16. Airline Company\nLength: Medium (30 Minutes)\nProblem:\nOur client is a major airline company and the CEO contacts you (a BCG partner) and said\nthat he wanted to put one more passenger on each of his company’s flights. We will go to\na meeting with him now and we need to prepare two things:\n• The financial return of one more passenger per flight. Is it worthwhile to do so?\n• The marketing strategy to attract these new passengers.\nSolution:\nFirst element of the solution: The financial return\nTo calculate the financial return, the candidate should look that the revenue and cost side\nof bringing one more passenger per flight.\nOne the revenue side, we need:\n• Average cost of a ticket;\n• Number of new passengers.\nThe candidate should also briefly ask about if he can assume that there is enough capacity\nto put one more passenger onboard.\nSecond element of the solution: The average cost of a ticket\nThe candidate should ask about the kind of routes, the market share, and then price of\neach of them.\nIn this case, we were talking about the Brazilian market and this airline has only domestic\nflights. The interviewer simplified the numbers a lot the make the calculations easier.\nYou should adapt the numbers to US domestic airline market or any other you would\nlike. For Brazil, the interviewer gave the following information:\n• 60% of the flights are between two major cities (Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro),\nwhich are 45 minutes apart and the ticket costs US$100.00;\n• 20% between other major capitals which are 1 hour and a half apart from each\nother and the ticket also costs US100.00;\n• 20% between other cities which are 3 hours apart and cost US$ 300.00.\nSo the average ticket price is: (80% * 100 + 20% * 300) / 100 = $ 140.00\nThird Element of Solution: Number of new passengers\nThere are several ways to come up with the number of new passengers. I proposed two:\n1. Calculate the number of flights: estimate the number of airplanes that the\ncompany owns and then estimate the number of flights each airplane does.\n2. Calculate the number of cities (average) in which the company makes flights\nand the average number of flights per city.\nThe interviewer said that I should use the first approach since he had looked at the\ncompany’s website and he found out that they have 100 airplanes.\nI asked if I could assume that 80% of the planes were used for the 1 hour flights and 20%\nfor 3 hour flights. He answered that this was not 100% true in practice because depending\nHaas Consulting Club Case Book 52\n\non the city, we could have more frequent flights than others, but he agreed that I could do\nthis approximation. The interviewee can come up with other reasonable assumptions.\nThe candidate should also notice that normally the company spends a lot of money and\ntime performing maintenance on its airplanes. If the candidate forgets to mention this and\nstarts using all 110 airplanes, you should ask what assumptions he made to use the all the\nplanes at once. For this company, the interviewer mentioned that this company had a little\nless than 10% of its airplane in maintenance.\nSo, assuming 100 airplanes available, we have:\n• 100 × 80% = 80 airplanes doing 1 hour flights\n• 100 × 20% = 20 airplanes doing 3 hours flights\nTo estimate the number of flights per airplane per day, we need the range of hours of\nflights during a day and the interval of time in which an airplane stays on the ground.\nWhat the interviewer wants to hear is not the right number, but what are your\nassumptions to get to the numbers, for example:\nFourth Element of Solution: Flight time\n• The first airplane departs at 6:00 am because the executives must arrive at its\nclient’s at 8:00 am, for example.\n• There will be no flights after 10:00 pm, so we will assume that the last flight will\narrive at midnight.\nSo, there is no flight between midnight and 6:00 am.\nFifth Element of Solution: On the ground time:\n• Taxing – 10 minutes\n• Passengers going out – 15 minutes\n• Cleaning / food supply – 10 minutes\n• Passenger going in – 15 minutes\n• Taxing – 10 minutes\nTotal: 60 minutes (cid:3) 1 hour.\nTherefore, based on the above we have:\n• 18h / 2h = 9 short flights per day\n• 18/h / 4h ~ 4 long flights per day\n• 80 × 9 short flights per day = 720 flights\n• 20 × 4 long flights per day = 80 flight\n• Total = 800 flights per day\nSo, the extra revenue in one month is 800 flights / day * 30 days * $140 = $ 3,360,000\nOn the cost side, the candidate should realize that the cost of one extra passenger is only\nthe marginal cost, which can be ignored. Therefore, the extra profit is the extra revenue.\nThe interviewer asked why was it important to have this row estimation about the extra\nprofit before going to meet the client. I said that it was important to have a sense of the\nsize of the clients’ issue and the interviewer agreed.\nHaas Consulting Club Case Book 53",

How would you go\nabout investigating the cause of the decline and help them improve their share price.\nSuggested Approach:\nRecognize that share price is based on expectations of future profits. This insight will\nlead directly to a profitability (revenue/cost) framework. You should mention both the\nrevenue side and the cost side as potential reasons why profits (and share price) might be\nfalling. Good questions to hone in on a particular area are: Have prices been falling? Has\nthe client been selling fewer planes? Have component costs risen? Have there been\nsignificant capital expenditures or maintenance expenditures? There are many similar\nquestions one could ask\nThe interviewer should mention that the military aircraft industry has been contracting\ndue to cutbacks in military spending. This environment would limit prospects for\nimproving revenue and focus discussion on costs.\nThere are a variety of ways to cut costs: cutting fixed costs by closing plants, automating\nmore of the operation, using more common parts among plane models, managing\ninventory better, training operators to be more efficient. The main point here is to think\nbroadly. Remember that costs are not only a function of the materials and equipment, but\nalso of the work practices, available technology, and skill of the workers.\nIn this particular case, the recommendation to the client was to try to merge with a\nweaker player to realize some economies of scale. When told that there were five players\nin the market, it was easy to see that not all would survive a market contraction.

Calculate the volume of this cylinder – πr2 × l. Then estimate the\nvolume of a ping pong ball (1 inch sphere, for example) and calculate it’s volume\n(1.33×πr3). A division should give an answer. In addition, one could estimate the air\nspace left when ping pong balls are packed in a cylinder and correct the answer (let’s say\n25% space is wasted). To get to more accuracy you could also ask if there are seats in the\nplane or if the wings could also be filled with ping pong balls. Don’t stop here – you can\nalways question why we are trying to fit ping pong balls in a 747 in the first place.

Show Exhibit 1 to candidate up\nfront.\n2) Case question #1: Will the proposed “Suite” strategy increase company profitability?\nMATH: Once the candidate has asked appropriate questions and layed out a logical framework\nto the first three exhibits, ask him to calculate the profitability of this strategy based on the\nresults of the concept test.\nCaveat: don’t worry about upgrades or software lifecycles, assume all customers buy full\nversions of the product.\n3) Question and Answer Period #1\nProfitability Analysis\n1. Q: What are the current prices of each of the four products, and how will they change in\nthe new business model?\nA: See Exhibit 2. Interpretation: the increased pricing of photo editing and desktop\npublishing products may motivate some customers to buy the Suite instead, but also may\ncause some customers to balk.\n2. Q: How many customers will upsell to the Suite?\nA: See Exhibit 1.\n3. Q: How many customers will the company lose because of the increased prices for the\nphoto editing and desktop publishing products?\nA: See Exhibit 1.\n4. Q: Will the company capture any new customers who will purchase the Suite who would\nnot have purchased any point products?\nA: Assume that all Suite customers are upsold from point products.\n5. Q: What are the variable costs of producing each of the products?\nA: See Exhibit 2. Interpretation: the photo editing and desktop publishing products yield\nthe most profitability, but the new Suite will also be fairly profitable\n\n60 Chicago GSB Management Consulting Group 1st Year Casebook 2004-2005\n6. Q: Are there additional fixed costs that the company will incur to launch the new product?\nA: Assume that additional fixed costs and synergies gained from the product strategy are\na wash in the short term.\n7. Q: How many units of each product does the company sell?\nA: See Exhibit 3.\n4) Answer Discussion\nSee resulting calculation in Exhibit 4. A good answer to the analysis is that although the Suite\nstrategy is slightly more profitable than the status quo, it’s not a clear winner. An outstanding\ncandidate will easily grasp the impact of cannibalization and price increases on the product mix.\n5) Case Question #2\nStart by giving answer to Case Question #1 if the candidate did not calculate correctly.\nBackground: It appears that there is marginal upside for the company in pursuing the Suite\nstrategy from a near-term profitability standpoint.\nQuestion: What are some additional long-term factors that the company should consider to make\na decision on the Suite strategy?\n6) Question and Answer Period\nMarket Opportunity\n1. Q: Examine growth, market share, and size of each category.\nA: See Exhibit 3. Interpretation: the newer categories represent significant market\nopportunities in terms of both size and growth.\n2. Q: What is the overlap between customers in each category?\nA: Almost all customers own products from at least three of the four software categories\nwhen you include their ownership of competitive products. The majority of our client’s\ncustomers own competitive products in the web design and video editing categories.\n3. Q: Will customers actually adopt the video editing and web design software as a result of\nowning the Suite if they were previously using competitive products?\nA: Research shows that after customers who own our client’s market leading software\nproducts and try the company’s video editing and web design software products will\nswitch from competitors 75% of the time.\n4. Q: What does the competition look like in the video editing and web design markets?\nA: Both categories are currently fragmented by numerous small companies.\n7) Answer Discussion\nBased on the direction of market growth, it is imperative that the company gain success with its\nnewer products in order to maintain long-term growth.

Shift in distribution channels\ncould cause us to lose volume/market share): This is where the changes are.\nInterviewees should ask following questions:\nWhere are our client’s products distributed: specialty stores and discount stores.\nWhat is the manufacturing cost: $80/stroller\nWhat are prices selling to retailers: $100 to specialty store, $90 to discount stores\n(Interviewee should work out the profit margin of the client using different channel: (100-\n80)/80=25% at specialty store, (90-80)/80=12.5% at discount stores). Interview should realize\nthat a shift from specialty store to discount store could squeeze the client’s margin.\nThen, interviewees should realize the consolidation in retailers and the emergence of larger\ndiscount retailers such as Wal-Mart is changing the landscape of distribution channels. Many\nspecialty stores are being and have been forced out of the business by these major discount stores.\nInterviewee should ask questions about the composition of sales. Specifically, the interviewee\nshould drive toward identifying the percentage of sales the client derives from specialty store\nsales vs. discount stores. The answer is 80% and 20% respectively.\nA good candidate will ask about historical averages or trends in the client composition. For\nexample, the industry average has moved to 40% sales from specialty stores and 60% from\ndiscount stores. Five years ago the average was closer to our clients mix, i.e. it was 40% and\n60% for discount and specialty stores respectively. It is true that our client has always had a\nreputation of selling product thorugh the specialty channel. The problem is quite clear now. The\nindustry model is moving away from our client’s specialty and disproportionately to discount\nstores.\nA good candidate will review the problem with the interviewer. The goal as a candidate at this\npoint is to engage the interviewer in a conversation. The candidate should have identified the\nproblem as follows:\n1) Market is shifting towards discount stores (due to the increase power of major discount\nstores).\n2) Specialty stores are in turn likely decreasing in number as they get squeezed out.\n3) However, our client is still selling 80% of its products in specialty stores. Our client is\nfacing significant risk of losing volume and market share if it doesn’t change its\ndistribution channel mix. A secondary problem a good candidate will point our is that our\nclient’s margin will decrease if/when it moves towards discount stores.\n\n44 Chicago GSB Management Consulting Group 1st Year Casebook 2004-2005\nConsumers: Consumers’ purchasing criteria and behavior did not change much except that more\nand more consumers are buying the product from discount stores.\nRecommendations:\nThe emergence of major discount stores are squeezing out the specialty stores and changing\nconsumer purchasing behavior. Although, the discount stores offer a lower margin, our client\nmay have to shift distribution efforts to the discount stores from specialty stores.\nWhat other options can the candidate brainstorm on? A good candidate will throw out potential\nideas such as:\n1) Our client should explore other distribution channels – such as catalogue sales and/or bundling\nand joint ventures with other baby products and companies to cross sell.\n2) An out of the box think might suggest something like exploring opportunities of selling\nthrough the doctors to new moms at the hospital.\nThe key to doing this case well is identifying the facts that define the problem. There is no set\nanswer to the problem. The only thing that is clear is that a structural shift has occurred and the\nclient is going to have to alter its previously static strategy to respond.

However, the client’s\npresence is now so diffuse that it must also look inside for internal growth. The owner of the store has\ntested a new pilot program for its digital camera division in year 2002. The goal of the test is to test the\nclient’s current sales generalist model.

Each\nwas expected to handle all tasks related to sales and products including client interactions, inventory\n(ordering), and shelf management.\nWith the new program, the client interaction function is separated from the other functions and carried out\nby sales specialists.

I would like to find out how much, if at all,\nthe new sales model increased the profit of the digital camera division per store”.\nA good candidate will get at least three of the below replies. It is crucial that the interviewer take on a\nclient perspective here. The client will be paying significant consideration for our advice. The candidate’s\nsetting up the problem quickly in an efficient, confident, expert manner is key to client handling. If the\ncandidate is slow or hesitates in this brainstorming section then respond with clear frustration. On the\nother hand if the candidate throws out solid ideas including those below and others that they may think of\nthen reward them with positive feedback and clear enthusiasm into their opinion.\nSince it is a program related to sales, I would like to look at impact to the morale/motivation of the sales\nteam\n• I would also look at the customers feedback. Do customers like the new model better and are we\nseeing increased traffic in our digital camera division\n• Finally competitor response. Have competitors shown signs of watching and/or imitating our\nprogram? This provides insight into the success of the program.\nQuestion 2: Good. As you mentioned that you would like to look at the economics of the new\nprogram. Why don’t we look at this then? I have all the financial statements with me, which\nnumber you would like to start with?\nSuggested answer: Eventually, I would like to look at the profit per store of the digital camera division\nbefore and after the program. If that number is not readily available, we could first look at the revenue per\nstore.\n\n46 Chicago GSB Management Consulting Group 1st Year Casebook 2004-2005\nAdditional information about digital camera division that candidate should ask:\nRev information\n2001 2002\nStore number 100 150\nTotal revenue 32.5mn 47.25mn\nRev/store* 0.325mn 0.315mn\nTotal camera sold 20000 45000\nCamera sold /store* 200 300\n* Candidate should quickly and confidently work out the rev/store numbers and camera sold/store number\nProduct information:\nProduct mix Profit margin Quantity sold Quantity/store* Quantity sold Quantity/store*\n($/camera) in 2001 in 2002\nHigh end digital 200 7500 75 7500 50\ncamera\nMedium end 200 7500 75 7500 50\nLow end 50 5000 50 30000 200\n*Candidate should work out the Quantity sold/store 2001 and 2002.\nSales compensation info:\nThe compensation of the specialist is based on the quantity of the camera sold.\nConclusion of the case:\nTotal revenue of the digital camera division increased in year 2002. The growth of the revenue came from\ntwo avenues: new stores opened and the new program. However, revenue per store of the digital camera\ndivision decreased. Possible reasons are: new stores generate less revenue as they are not operating at\nefficiency, also when company grows quickly; new stores are opened in less optimal locations.\nHowever, the main reason is because product mix is changing due to the new program. Numbers of high\nend and medium end camera (which have higher margins) sold per store are decreasing while low end\ncamera is increasing. This is because specialists are recommending the low end cameras to the consumers.\nWhy specialists are doing that? Because low end camera is easy to sell due to its simple function and low\nprice and that specialists are compensated for number of cameras sold, but not profit they bring to the\nstore. A good candidate will derive this insight in the course of the conversation. In fact, a good candidate\nwill make this “discovery” during the interview and make the interviewer feel as if they did it together. Id\nthe candidate simply solves the simple math but doesn’t involve the interviewer or create a feeling of\ndiscovery then they have not cracked this case.\nConclusion:\nThe client is selling more cameras due to the new program. However, selling more cameras has not\nresulted in increased revenue/profit because specialists are compensated in the way that motivates them to\nsell low end low margin product. Thus, the client should modify the program, focusing on\neducating/training its specialist and basing their compensation not just on quantity of sales but on the\nprofit they generate for the store. If the modified program is successful, the client should promote the\n\n47 Chicago GSB Management Consulting Group 1st Year Casebook 2004-2005\nprogram to other divisions. However, the client should always consider the differences of the other\ndivisions and the digital camera division to apply modification to the program.\nSuggestions of the case:\n• It is about retail industry, thus candidate should either realize or learn from the interviwer that\nprofit or revenue per store is the key measure of performance.\n• It is about the implementation of new program, thus benefit and analysis is the main structure –\nanalyzing the economics of the new program – does it increase the profit of the digital camera\ndivision per store? A good candidate will ask how much does it cost to train specialists and how\nmuch more does it cost now that former generalist functions have been transferred to other\ndepartments. We don’t have these numbers but you can assume they are not immaterial.\n• The case also contains a profitability problem. It is about a program that changes sales function,\nthus its focus is on the revenue side. The candidate should focus on the rev/store. From the\nadditional information we know that total revenue increased while the revenue per store\ndecreased. We know two factors affect revenue – price and quantity. Then candidate should look\nat the number of camera sold per store (it is increased). So, we have quantity increased while\nrevenue decreased, which tells us that average price per store decreased. This leads us to look at\nthe product mix / customer mix. Product mix change will change the average price and affect the\nmargin.\n• This case is about a program that changes the sales function. When it is talking about sales\norganization/function, sales incentive is normally involved. Then one should look at the\ncompensation to see whether the sales force is compensated in the right way.\n\n48 Chicago GSB Management Consulting Group 1st Year Casebook 2004-2005",

To increase growth Great Burger is thinking of acquiring\nHeavenly Donuts.\nHeavenly Donuts (HD) is a young coffee/donut chain. It’s business model is a territorial\nfranchise model, i.e. franchisers are granted specific regions to sell donuts into. HD is a\nworldwide company.\nThe CASE is – is HD a good acquisition and match for GB?\nQuestions:\n1: What is your road map to approach this case?\nThis is an acquisition case. Ask the candidate how they plan to structure a road map to assess\nwhether or not acquiring HD is a good strategy. There are several aspects of the problem the\ncandidate should consider:\n(cid:131) First, ask the candidate to provide additional motivations in addition to simple sales\ngrowth. Some of them are as follows: increased market coverage, product diversification,\nto pre-empt potential competition, derive operation synergies (economies of scope and\nscale) and lower costs, financial synergies (lower cost of capital), realize tax gains if HD\n(which is a young company) has losses (which increases probability of tax gains.)\n(acquirer transfers tax losses of target to offset income)\n(cid:131) Second, Standalone analysis of HD’s business: Is the donut business profitable (attractive)\nbusiness to be in?

Revenue synergies: market coverage - GB covers more market than HD, it could bring\nHD into more markets (such as Europe and Asia). Based upon it s better local business\nknowledge GB could more rapidly bring HD into markets and in some geographies even\nexperiment with cross-selling to the customers (i.e. placing the stores right next to each\nother under one roof).\n2. Cost savings through economies of scale/scope: raw material purchasing (volume\ndiscount), consolidate property and equipment, decrease Corp SG&A.\n3. Improve HD’s operation: GB is performing better than industry average while HD’s is\nperforming worse than the industry average. GB could transfers its better franchise model\nand store management to HD to improve HD’s performance.\nThere is sufficient data above for numerous observations. A good interviewer will push the\ncandidate to find 5 at least. In the end 4 would be enough if the candidate communicated the\nfindings in a confident, enthusiastic, and relationship building manner.\nQuestion 3: If we can double HD’s market share in 5 years, what is the Rev/store need to be?\nAssuming the total market size does not change and HD’s store number does not change.\nCurrently HD’s total rev is 700mn, total store number is 1020. To double the market share, HD’s\n\n50 Chicago GSB Management Consulting Group 1st Year Casebook 2004-2005\nrev need to be doubled, thus per store revenue would also need to be doubled. So per store\nrevenue would need to be (700*2)/1020 = 1.37mn.\nIs this possible?\nWere talking about doubling sales in 5 years. Based upon its younger age and opportunities for\nentering new markets where GB already is this should be feasible. However, candidate should\nmention caveats of: consumers’ needs, competitors’ response and GB and HD’s ability to see\nwhether it is possible to reach this per store revenue.\nOther areas the interviewer could develop involve company cultures and management issues.\nThey are not beyond the scope of the case but we leave it to the interviewer to be creative in\nmaking them up. Remember getting ready for a case interview is as much as being a good\ninterviewer (i.e. practicing relationship building and creativity skills) as much as anything else.\nSo have fun with this case!\n\n51 Chicago GSB Management Consulting Group 1st Year Casebook 2004-2005",

The CEO and\nclient, Vivian, wants to improve profit. What would you recommend?\nThe Candidate should lay out a clear structure at the beginning of the case and follow the structure to get\nthe following information\nSuggested approach:\nThis is a typical profitability case, thus the candidate should lay out a clear profitability case structure at\nthe very beginning, finding out the areas on both revenue and cost sides that the client could improve to\nincrease its profit.\nWhen approaching a case, candidate should also take a second thinking about the characteristics of the\nindustry: what are the key revenue/cost drivers, what are the key trends in the industry. This normally\nhelps. In this case, it is the retail industry, thus candidate should realize that revenue per square foot or\nrevenue per store is the key.\nAdditional Information\nRevenue side information:\nRevenue stream % of total % of store space Profit margin Growth rate\nrevenue occupied\nNew video rental 60% 20% Higher than N/a\nclassic video\nClassic video 20% 60% N/a\nrental\nGame 5% 5% N/a\nNew video sales 10% 10% N/a\nConvenient – 5% 5% High N/a\ncandy, popcorn\nand etc.\nNote: candidate should either know, ask, or determine that revenue per square foot (or revenue per store)\nis the key measurement of the performance of retail stores. If they don’t bring it up themselves then\nprompt them to explore key metrics. Encourage them to brainstorm around this topic, reward them with\npositive feedback if they get the answer.\nCandidate should also realize that different products provide different profit margins and different\nrevenue/square foot and growth rate. In this case, after the candidate gets the above information, he/she\ncould easily notice the problem the client is having – 60% of the store space is devoted to 20% of revenue,\nwhich is not rational. Thus, the store layout should be re-designed. Candidate should also notice that the\nstore is able to charge premium price on the convenient products.\nCost side information:\nMain cost items % of total sales Industry average / best\npractice / competitors\n\n55 Chicago GSB Management Consulting Group 1st Year Casebook 2004-2005\nLabor 20% 15%\nStore cost 30% 30%\nContent 40% 40%\nProfit margin* X = 10% 15%\nNote: candidate should work out the profit margin with the cost information.\nNote: the candidate should discuss the main drivers retail store profitability and growth with the\ninterviewer. Candidates should seize on the contrast of the client’s cost structure with the industry\naverages, or the best practice or that of the competitors. In this case, the candidate should realize that the\nclient is being hurt by higher labor costs.\nThe candidate should start to drill down on this issue, i.e. he/she should ask for more information on the\nlabor cost side.\nLabor cost information: 50% of labor cost in serving customers, 10% in storing and 40% in\nrecommending. Our client on average requires 4 employees per similar sized store while competitors are\nusing 3 employees.\nCandidate should ask for the difference in store management technique between the client and the best\npractice to find out why competitors are using less people, however, no further information is available.\nAsk the candidate to brain storm as to reason why we are less efficient. Numerous answers are available –\nthe key is relationship building with the interviewer, creativity in answers, and confidence in deliverance.\nNote: by now, the candidate should know on the cost side, the client should at least reduce its labor cost\nto achieve industry average.\nSuggested Recommendation:\nOn the revenue side:\n• The store layout should be redesigned so that more space should be devoted to the main revenue\ndriver – new video rentals,\n• The store should also charge higher price on the convenient products to earn a high profit margin.\n• The store could also try to keep the customers in the store longer so that they would rent more\nVideo or consumer more convenient products\nOn the cost side:\nThe store should manage its labor force more efficiently. It could consider installing vending\nmachines that sell/rent video automatically, computer systems that recommend videos or in-store\npost recommending the latest top 10 etc. to reduce labor involvement.

  "Booth_2005_D. Martin’s Media": "D. Martin’s Media\nNote to interviewer, this case provides a case through by example, i.e. it provides an example of\ndialogue that might occur to solve the case. Use the dialogue as a guide. Your goal is to help the\nand test the candidate engage you in a similar dialogue to obtain the case answer and impress\nyou.\nCase Question:\nOur client, D. Martin Media, is a major country music national cable network in US. It is\nthinking about launching a country music magazine. Is this a good idea? What is the\neconomics of launching this magazine?\nInterviewee: As our client is thinking about entering into country music magazine market, before\nwe look at the economics of launching the magazine, I would like to first analyze the\nattractiveness of country magazine market: its overall market size, growth, competitive\nlandscape, consumer purchasing behavior, entry barrier and etc. Then, if the market is attractive,\nI would like to look at our clients’ capability to succeed in this market: where does it stand in\nline with the key successful factors in the magazine business? Could we create any synergy\nbetween the cable network and magazine business? Then, I would use cost and benefit analysis\nto look at the profitability of launching the magazine business. Finally, if all the above analysis is\nfavorable to our client, I would look at different options of entering this business: acquire a\ncurrent country magazine business, JV, or start a new operation.\nAs we are specifically looking at the economics of launching the magazine, I would like to focus\nmy analysis on the cost and benefit of launching this new magazine.\nInterviewer: Great! Why don’t we do that?\nInterviewee: Let’s start with looking at the revenue of the magazine business. With my\nunderstanding of the business, there will be two main revenue streams: subscription and\nadvertisement. Am I right? (note if the candidate doesn’t know this then prompt them for what\nyou think are the two main streams – they should be able to develop them on the spot).\nInterviewer: yes.\nInterviewee: Then I would like to ask whether we have any numbers on these revenues.\nInterviewer: We might. But if we didn’t immediately have the number then how would you\nsuggest our project team at the subscription revenue number?\nInterviewee: well, we could do quick market size estimation. We could divide the market into\nsubscribers and non-subscribers to our cable network. Let’s assume there are 100mn households\nin US. How many subscribers do we have?\n\n57 Chicago GSB Management Consulting Group 1st Year Casebook 2004-2005\nInterviewer: well, we know that there are totally 25mn households subscribing to country music\ncable networks. 60% of them are subscribing to us.\nInterviewee: Good. So 25mn * 60%, we have totally 15mn subscribers. Then there are 10mn\nhouseholds who subscribe to other country music cable networks. Lastly, we have 75mn\nhouseholds who don’t subscribe to any country music cable networks. My business common\nsense tells me that the conversion rate of our subscribers would be the highest as they listen to\nour cable network already which means that they like our collection of country music. We might\nbe able to get some potential customers from the 75mn household who haven’t subscribed to the\ncountry music cable network yet, but my guess is that the conversion rate would be very low. Do\nwe have any sense of these conversion rates?\nInterviewer: I would like you to tell me how would you get these conversation rates?\nInterviewee: one way is to look at these numbers of a competitor. If these data are not available,\nwe could do a market research using customer survey/interview.\nInterviewer: Good. Let’s assume 80% of our 15mn cable network subscriber would subscribe to\nour magazine. 20% of the 10mn subscribers to other cable network would subscribe to our\nmagazine. To make our life easy, let’s forget the 75mn non-subscribers for now.\nInterviewee: Good, we have totally: 15*80% + 10*20% = 14mn subscribers to our magazine.\nWhat is the revenue for an annual subscription?\nInterviewer: One magazine cost $4 and it will be published monthly.\nInterviewee: Then the subscription revenue will be: 14*4*12 = 672mn. Now, let’s move onto the\nadvertisement revenue. Do we have any data on this?\nInterviewer: we know that advertisement revenue is about 50% of the subscription revenue.\nInterviewee: So advertisement revenue is 672*50%= 336mn. Thus total revenue is 672+336 =\n1008. Now let’s move onto the cost side. As it is magazine business, I would assume that the\nmajor cost items would be: labor, printing, distribution, marketing & sales. Do we have any data\non this?\nInterviewer: our competitor has a 12% margin in the magazine business.\nInterviewee: Good. I would assume that our competitor enjoys some scale effect and operation\nefficiency while moving along the experience curve and thus has a higher margin than our client.\nThen, our client’s margin would be 10%. With revenue of 1008mn, the profit from magazine\nbusiness is around 100mn. It looks pretty good so far. Let’s see how significant this means to our\nclient’s business. How much profit our client is having right now?\nInterviewer: about 300mn.\n\n58 Chicago GSB Management Consulting Group 1st Year Casebook 2004-2005\nInterviewee: So magazine will bring 1/3 more profit, which is pretty good. From the pure\nnumber side, the economics looks very good. However, I would like to look more at the\nqualitative side. As I laid out my structure at the very beginning of the case, I would like to\nfurther investigate those areas, especially competitors’ response and customers’ feedback and our\nclient’s resources to see whether our client is able to get the 100mn profit for the magazine\nbusiness.\nInterviewer: very good. We will look at these later.\nNotes: It is not a very complicated case about entering the new market. It would be nice if the\ninterviewee could lay out the structure for entering the new market at the beginning of the case.\nHowever, as the interviewer is asking for economics, the focus should be on benefit and cost\nanalysis. The interviewer is testing the interviewees’ ability to carry out a market size estimation\nand to hold a high level strategy discussion as well. As the interviewer don’t be afraid to diverge\nfrom the path above. Use your own industry knowledge and experiences to push the candidate to\nbrainstorm more. However, do use the math questions to always bring the candidate back to the\ncase and get at and determine the final market size for the client.\n\n59 Chicago GSB Management Consulting Group 1st Year Casebook 2004-2005",
  "Booth_2005_Kenny’s Kapital Management": "Kenny’s Kapital Management\nOverview:\nKenny, our client, is founder and senior partner of the famous Hedge Fund Kenny’s Kapital.\nKenny developed the fund’s proprietary investment strategy over many hard working hours and\nnumerous years of painstaking research. The strategy can be summarized as such:\n1. Kenny Kapital invests in and selects from a universe of companies that have tradable\nsecurities (debt, equity and derivatives).\n2. The PM’s and analysts performs in-depth fundamental research and analysis on these\ncompanies\n3. The PMs decide on a position to take (short or long, type of security)\n4. The PMs seeks to exit/unwind typical position within 1-2 years.\nThe fund combines a proprietary computer program along with its fundamental analysis to\nenhance its security selection process. The computer program first shortlists the companies\nbased on criteria such as market capitalization, liquidity of securities and foreign exchange risk.\nIf so desired it then works out a recommended position to take based on weighted assessments\nalong dimensions such as market multiples-based valuation and bond yield-curve shape.\nThe fundamental analysis department then takes over, performing further research and analysis,\nand finally deciding on the position that the fund should take. The department currently has a\nstaff of 9 consisting of: 3 senior analysts (who, incidentally, are also the 3 partners of the firm),\n4 junior analysts (MBA-level), and 2 assistants (fresh college graduates).\nCurrently, of the 250 companies that the proprietary program shortlists, based on preliminary\ncriteria, only 100 or so get analyzed every year. The fund partners feel that significant\nopportunities are being left on the table, and would like to see how they can improve the\nsituation, such as possibly hiring more staff or investing in technology.\n\n65 Chicago GSB Management Consulting Group 1st Year Casebook 2004-2005\nDiscussion\nThis is an operations case. The candidate should recognize it and attempt to draw a process flow\ndiagram, such as:\n250 250 Fundamental 100\nProprietary\nAnalysis\nProgram\nDept\nClearly, the firm is not realizing the full potential of the ideas the computer program is short-\nlisting. The candidate should quickly realize that the bottleneck is in the Fundamental Analysis\nDept, and that the solution is to hire more staff.\nThe next question, then, is what level of staff to hire. The fund does not want to change the\nnumber of senior analysts that it already has. So it will only consider hiring additional junior\nanalysts or assistants.\nPrompt the candidate to ask questions about information they would seek in order to assess what\ntype and how many people to hire. As the candidate asks about the nature of work that each level\nof staff does, the following information can be revealed:\nThere are 3 steps to the process of fundamental analysis: Research, Analysis, and Strategy\nFormulation. These are typically 50%, 30% and 20% of the work (man-hours) that needs to be\ndone on a company.\nOf the Research work, 20% needs to be done by a partner, 60% can be done by a junior analyst\nand up, and 20% can be done by an assistant and up.\nOf the Analysis, 30% must be done by a partner, and 70% can be done by a junior analyst and up.\nOf the Strategy Formulation, 60% must be done by a partner, and 40% can be done by a junior\nanalyst and up.\nAll levels of staff are equally productive, provided they are doing the work they appropriate for\ntheir level.\nAt this point, the candidate should realize that it is important to work out what proportion of the\nwork must be done by a partner and by other staff respectively. Good candidates will work out\nthe following without to much prompting:\n1) (.2*.5+.3*.3+.6*.2)=31% of the process must be done by a partner,\n\n66 Chicago GSB Management Consulting Group 1st Year Casebook 2004-2005\n2) (.6*.5+.7*.3+.4*.2)=59% of the work can be done by a junior analyst and up,\n3) and (.2*.2)=10% of the work can be done by anyone.\nSo the optimal ratio of staff should be 3:6:1 (partners: junior analysts: assistants).\nSince the fund wants to keep the number of partners at 3, it can hire 2 more junior analysts\nwithout having to bring in another partner. This makes a total of 6 analysts. The firm is also free\nto let go one assistant. Ask the candidate the pros and cons of letting an assistant go (marginally\nlower cost but potentially important to have more then one assistant in case one leaves to\nbusiness school abruptly)\nThe candidate may approach the question from the direction of marginal revenue and marginal\ncost. This is not wrong, but the interviewer should guide the candidate back to the operations-\nbased approach by hinting that each additional company analyzed has an expected return of tens\nof millions of dollars, while each staff can be hired for hundreds of thousands of dollars (or less),\nand so the candidate should be able to conclude that the real constraint is that the number of\npartners is capped at 3.\nHigher Level Question 1: Good Candidates will get through the above fairly quickly. They will\nalso demonstrate ability to focus on what is important and engage the interviewer. A good\nquestion for candidates with operations backgrounds that they want to leverage in interviews or\nfocusing on going into operations include the following:\nIf the fund hired 2 more junior analysts as you recommend, what number of firms will the team\nbe able to process a year?\nIf the candidate assumes that none of the staff were idle before (a wrong assumption, since there\nis idleness in the system), then the candidate would answer that the throughput would increase by\n2/9, or 22%.\nIf the candidate assumed that only junior analysts were fully utilized before, and idleness existed\nat both the partner and assistant levels, then the candidate would respond that the throughput\nwould increase by 2/4 or 50% (since junior analysts increased from 4 to 6). This is again wrong,\nbecause all work that junior analysts do can also be done by partners, and so it is wrong to\nassume that partners are idle in the system.\nThe candidate should be able to realize that in the previous system, partners and junior analysts\nare fully utilized, but idleness exists at the assistant level. So increasing the junior analysts by 2\nis increasing the fully utilized staff by a factor of 2/7 or 29%. So the fund’s throughput should\nincrease to 129 companies analyzed a year.\nBonus Question 2\nIf there is additional time, the candidate could be asked what other ways the fund might optimize\ntheir procedure. This question is about relaxing the simplifying assumptions that were made in\nthe model used for addressing the questions above.\n\n67 Chicago GSB Management Consulting Group 1st Year Casebook 2004-2005\nThe model assumed, among other things, that the companies analyzed all took a fixed amount of\nwork and gave a standard (constant) expected return. If the proprietary program could give each\ncompany a unique expected return and an estimate of the time required for fundamental analysis,\nthe fund should prioritize its analysis according to the ratio of expected return to time required\nfor analysis. For example, if Company A had an expected return of $10 mil and required 5 man-\ndays to analyze, and Company B had an expected return of $5 mil and required 2 man-days to\nanalyze, then Company B should have a higher priority.\nPriorities are necessary since the fund can only analyze a fraction of the 250 shortlisted\ncompanies.\n\n68 Chicago GSB Management Consulting Group 1st Year Casebook 2004-2005",
  "Booth_2005_Brinda’s Hair Styles": "Brinda’s Hair Styles\nOverview\nLast week, you received a call from Kate, an old friend from college. Kate studied chemistry in\nschool and had gotten a job with a large household products firm after graduation. When the\neconomy went sour in the early 90’s, Kate got laid off and began cutting hair at a salon to make\nends meet. In 1994, Kate quit the salon to start Hair Co., a premium hair products business.\nHair Co. has been a tremendous success. The company has four major product lines: shampoos,\nconditioners, color products and styling products. Nearly all retail sales of Hair Co. products are\nthrough high-end salons.\nKate scheduled a lunch with you today in order to catch up but also to ask about some issues\nrelated to her company. After you get a table and chat for awhile, Kate says the following:\n“I think I’m ready to sell Hair Co. It’s been over ten years and I need a break. The business has\nbeen growing since day one and I’m sure it will sell for a nice number, especially in this\neconomy. However, before I talk to anyone, I want to know what I should expect to hear. I want\nto know what an investor is likely to think of Hair Co. I also want to know what kinds of things I\ncan do to make Hair Co. more attractive. I’ve prepared some financials since I knew you’d ask\nfor them.”\nKate hands you a sheet of paper with the following financial data and sits back in her chair.\n1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 CAGR\nRevenue 25 35 49 64 90 114 29%\nCOGS 7 10 14 21 32 50 39%\nGross Margin 18 25 35 43 58 64 24%\nSales & Marketing 2 3 4 6 9 13 37%\nResearch & Development 1 1 1 1 2 2 12%\nGeneral & Administrative 7 10 14 19 24 28 26%\nEBIT 8 11 16 17 23 21 17%\n\n69 Chicago GSB Management Consulting Group 1st Year Casebook 2004-2005\nQuestion & Answer\nThe case has two parts:\n(1) assess Hair Co. from the perspective of a potential buyer by commenting on the financial\ndata provided and gathering more information from the interviewer,\n(2) recommend specific ways in which the business could be improved given the information\nmade available.\nBusiness Assessment\nThe obvious problem facing Hair Co. is the decline in profitability from ’03 to ’04. The\ninterviewee should quickly point this out and then spend time discussing the causes of this\ndecline. A simple profitability framework is likely to be most useful. Issues for discussion\ninclude:\nDeclining Gross Margins: COGS is clearly growing faster than revenue. The reason for the\ndecline is related to a change in Hair Co.’s sales mix. When requested, the following\ninformation may be provided.\n1999 2004\nShampoo Conditioner Color Styling Shampoo Conditioner Color Styling\nGM 70 75 60 NA 67 74 54 30\n% of Sales 75 20 5 0 57 11 4 28\nThe addition of styling products is the most significant reason for the overall decline in gross\nmargin. The interviewee should spend some time considering reasons why margins in Styling\nare so much lower.\nHair Co. has not been able to leverage its strong brand in Shampoos and Conditioners since it\nentered the Styling market in 2000. Consumers believe that Hair Co. styling products are of\nabove average quality but are inferior to products offered by companies that only offer styling\nproducts. Hair Co. has resorted to discounting in order to get salons to carry its styling products.\nMargins for Hair Co.’s other products have also declined due to falling prices. It is likely that\nthe line of styling products is having a negative impact on Hair Co.’s other lines.\nSales & Marketing Expense: Spending on sales and marketing is clearly growing at a faster rate\nthan revenue and has contributed to the decline in EBIT. One reason is that Hair Co. has spent\nheavily to promote the Styling line. Another is that Hair Co. is beginning to saturate the salon\nmarket and must now spend more to create new customers.\nLow R&D Spending Growth: Spending has not kept pace with revenue growth. There is likely a\nconnection between the lower perceived quality of the styling line and the under-investment in\nR&D.\nImprovement Opportunities\n\n70 Chicago GSB Management Consulting Group 1st Year Casebook 2004-2005\nThe interviewee should recommend that Hair Co. do something about its styling line. If the\nrecommendation is to drop styling, some way of replacing 30% of revenue must be suggested.\nOne solution is to begin selling Hair Co. products in other channels (i.e. supermarkets, drug\nstores and/or mass merchandisers.)\nAlternatively, the interviewee may suggest that Hair Co. increase investment in R&D and\nimprove the styling product line. However, altering consumers’ perceptions will be difficult.\nOne solution is to launch a re-branding campaign once changes to the styling products have been\nmade.\nThe interviewee should also address the market saturation issue. It seems likely that revenue will\nnot continue to grow at 30% per year unless new channels are tapped or new products are\nintroduced. Given that Hair Co. has had difficulty with introducing new products, new channels\nare the most likely the best source of growth.\nIf selling through new channels is recommended, consideration must be given to the following:\nWould sales in other channels simply divert sales from the salons or would they result in an\nincrease in total sales volume? Would prices remain the same in other channels? What costs\nmust Hair Co. incur when entering a new sales channel?\nMath Problem\nSuppose that Hair Co. is going to sell its shampoo line in drug stores. Ask the candidate to write\nan equation or solve for the average price in drug stores that is required to create 10% growth in\ncurrent salon-only revenue:\nAverage DS Price = [(1.1 * Current Salon Volume * Current Average Salon Price) – (Post-DS\nSalon Volume * Post-DS Average Salon Price)] / DS Volume\nWhat is the required DS price if:\nCurrent Salon Volume = 100\nCurrent Salon Average Price = $5\nPost DS Salon Volume = 80\nPost DS Salon Price = $5\nDS Volume = 50\nAnswer: Average DS Price must be $3\n. . . . .\n\n71 Chicago GSB Management Consulting Group 1st Year Casebook 2004-2005",

After data-\ngathering, the candidate must construct a logical method to value the project. Answers to potential questions are as\nfollows:\nA good candidate will engage the interviewer in a dialogue that bring out all the below info.

We can deduce from what we know from Slide\n3 that:\n6000 motorists * net of $0.50/crossing * 10 crossings/week * 50 weeks/year = $1.5M/year\n3000 motorists * net of $1.50/crossing * 10 crossings/week * 50 weeks/year = $2.25M/year\n1000 motorists * net of $2.50/crossing * 10 crossings/week * 50 weeks/year = $1.25M/year\n500 motorists * net of $4.50/crossing * 10 crossings/week * 50 weeks/year = $1.125M/year\n(cid:131) The thorough candidate has asked about the willingness to pay of non-peak motorists\n(Slide 4). We can deduce from what we known from Slide 3 that:\n5000 motorists * $0.50/crossing * 14 crossings/week * 50 weeks/year = $1.75M/year\n3000 motorists * $1.50/crossing * 14 crossings/week * 50 weeks/year = $3.15M/year\n2000 motorists * $2.50/crossing * 14 crossings/week * 50 weeks/year = $3.5M/year\n500 motorists * $3.50/crossing * 14 crossings/week * 50 weeks/year = $1.225M/year\n(cid:131) Remember that Slide 4 specifies that data is shown as a daily average, per motorist, which means that\nthis calculation is based on a seven-day week, and that each motorist will logically make a two-way trip for\na total of fourteen crossings.\nValue of Bridge Project\n(cid:131) We know the bridge must bring in $4M/year in net revenues in order for the project to go ahead.\n(cid:131) By totaling customer willingness to pay at each level, we can determine whether the $4M net revenue\ngoal can be reached, and, if it can be reached at more than one toll level, which one would be most\nprofitable.\nTotal Revenue @ $x Toll = Revenue @ $x Toll for Peak Motorists+Revenue @ $x Toll for\nOthers\nTotal Revenue @ $1 Toll = 1.5M+ 1.75M = $3.25M/year\nTotal Revenue @ $2 Toll = 2.25M+ 3.15M = $5.4M/year\nTotal Revenue @ $3 Toll = 1.25M + 3.5M = $4.75M/year\nTotal Revenue @ $4 Toll = 0 +1.225M = $1.225M/year\nTotal Revenue @ $5 Toll = 1.125M + 0 = $1.125M/year\n(cid:131) Case conclusion is that yes, the bridge project can be profitable, and that the profit-\nmaximizing toll-level would be $2 per crossing\nAnswer Discussion\nCertain points listed under “Key Issues and Data for Q&A” are labeled Basic, Better, or Best.\nCandidates who understand the question but lack depth of insight will mostly limit themselves to “Basic”\nitems. Candidates who dig deeper, but not as deep as the most sophisticated set of questions and\n\n74 Chicago GSB Management Consulting Group 1st Year Casebook 2004-2005\ncalculations limit themselves to “Better”. Candidates who cover most items under Basic and Better, and\nfollow through toward completing a logical valuation can be classified as “Best”, though there is only one\n“Best” item.

Examples of this would be asking about discount rates, NPV, taxes,\ngovernment or regulatory issues, etc. The best candidates will pay attention to details such as legends on\ngraphs, etc.\nThis case requires no specific framework. However, the more key issues candidates can identify by name,\nand the faster they can do so, the better we can say they have done on the case.

It is important to determine the age of the dinosaur.\nSince the client does not know the age and average lifespan, the candidate should suggest\nways of determining the age and lifespan of the dinosaur. Some suggestions could be\nasking anthropologist, DNA testing, fossil testing, and etc.\nBesides knowing the expected lifespan of the dinosaur and all the revenues and cost, the\ncandidate needs to ask about the discount rate. Now with all the information, the\ncandidate can determine the most the client should pay for the dinosaur. Again, the\ncalculations are not important but knowing the right equation is.\nNPV = Fixed Cost – [(revenues – cost)] / discount rate\n(assume revenues and costs are static over time to simplify the equation)\nTo solve for maximum cost of dinosaur assume the minimum NPV = 0.\nQuestion 3\nThe candidate should ask about the size of the dinosaur before recommending the size of\nthe exhibit area. An example answer will be – Since the dinosaur is the size of an\nelephant, a football field will be a good size area. If the dinosaur is at the other end of the\nfield, the spectators will still be able to see the dinosaur.\nSuppose the exhibit area is round with a diameter of 100 yards, what is the circumference\nof the exhibit area? Circumference = Π * Diameter\nThe candidate should realize that there will be a heavy demand to view the dinosaur.\nSpectators will be coming from all over the world to see the world’s only dinosaur. It is\nimportant to cycle the spectators through the exhibit area so they have an enjoyable visit\nand the client is able to get as many spectators through as possible in a day.\nHow will you route the spectators around the exhibit area?\nIf the candidate proposes having the spectators walk around the exhibit area in either a\nclockwise or counter clockwise direction, have them explain how they will prevent traffic\nfrom collecting around the location the dinosaur ( ) is at.\n85\n\n86 Chicago GSB Management Consulting Group 1st Year Casebook 2004-2005\nA B\nIdeal Situation - Every spectator has the same view.\nA B\nNot the ideal situation - The spectators at A and B don’t have the same view. Traffic will\nlikely build up at B. Ask the candidate, how can you prevent this from happening?\nThere is no right or wrong answer. An example will be – Make the exhibit area like an\namusement ride. Therefore the client can prevent traffic from building up and the client\ncan control the cycle time the spectators spend in the exhibit area. Another good answer\n– Is to have the exhibit level multiple levels so the client can cycle more spectators\nthrough.\nRight approach\no The right approach should quickly focus on the Net Present Value equation and what\nthe revenue and cost of this project are. NPV = Current Cost – Present Value\n(Revenues – Cost)\no Revenue should be broken down into all the possible avenues that will generate sales.\nCost should be broken down in all the possible costs that are associated with the\nproject.\no Realizing the dinosaur does not live forever therefore the revenue stream would\ndisappear as soon as the dinosaur died.\nRisks\n86\n\n87 Chicago GSB Management Consulting Group 1st Year Casebook 2004-2005\n• The dinosaur could die of diseases in north asmerica.\n• No zoo in the world has ever cared for a dinosaur before.

  "Booth_2005_Wacky Wireless Company – Industry Analysis Case": "Wacky Wireless Company – Industry Analysis Case\n1) Overview\n• Your client is a private equity firm.\n• The client has asked you to do due diligence on a Wacky Wireless, a Puerto Rican\nwireless company.\n• The company is the third largest player on the market and has 20% market share.\n• Historically, Puerto Rico has seen double digit growth in demand for wireless\nservices.\n2) Case question\nIs this is a good business for your client to invest in? Please assess the company’s future\ngrowth and profitability; a full-blown valuation is unnecessary.\n3) Question and Answer Period\n1. Market Opportunity\n• Q: How large is the wireless market in Puerto Rico?\n• A: Do not directly give the candidate an answer, but ask them to try to estimate\nthe figures below.\no Population of Puerto Rico is 4.0 million\no Number of people who currently subscribe to wireless service is only\n1.6 million people (40% penetration)\no Growth of population is 2%/year\n• Q: Does 40% market penetration mean that Puerto Rico represents a great market\nopportunity?\n• A: Do not directly give the answer, but ask the candidate what information they\nwould look for to answer this question. Some good ideas:\no Forecasted growth rate for wireline services in Puerto Rico (info n/a)\no Compare Puerto Rico to more developed countries (mature markets) to\nsee what market penetration in wireless services looks like over time\n(good answer, but info n/a)\no Compare Puerto Rico to more developed countries to see how much\ndemand for wireline services has declined and use substitution rates\n(good answer, info n/a)\no Consider purchasing power in Puerto Rico – 50% of population lives\nunder the poverty line (show Exhibit 1)\n2. Pricing\n• Q: Have prices for wireless services remained steady?\n• A: Show Exhibit 2. Good interpretation: there is downward pressure on prices,\nwhich have declined quickly in recent years.\n• Math: Ask the candidate to calculate the market opportunity\na. Total Potential Market = 4.0 million people * 50% potential customers *\n$30/customer/month * 12 months\n88\n\n89 Chicago GSB Management Consulting Group 1st Year Casebook 2004-2005\n= $720 million\n3. Costs\n• Q: How do the target company’s fixed and variable costs compare with the\ncompetition?\n• A: See Exhibit 3. Good interpretation: the network costs are for the most part\ncomparable; the target’s fixed costs are slightly higher but will improve slowly\nwith some low economies of scale.\n• Q: Are there any significant capital requirements for the target to scale up its\nnetwork?\n• A: No\n4. Competition/Barriers to Entry\n• Q: Who are the other major competitive players?\n• A: AT&T and Sprint own 70% of the market; they have recently entered by\npurchasing existing companies.\n• Q: Are there any significant regulatory issues that limit growth?\n• A: No, regulation is not an issue\n4) Answer Discussion\nIndustry Analysis\nCompetition Market Pricing Cost\nDemand Infrastructure\nConclusion:\n• Client should be wary of this investment because the wireless service market is\napproaching saturation in Puerto Rico.\n• The target company does not have significant cost advantages over competitors and\nprices are declining, putting a squeeze on profitability.\n• The existence of large competitors with major market share and deep pockets is also a\nconcern.\nGood Answer:\n• In order to solve this case, it is important that the candidate dig deeply into the market\nopportunity in Puerto Rico. A good candidate would be able to come up with at least\ntwo different ways of measuring whether 40% penetration is a lot or a little.\n• The candidate should cover all of the framework elements above to make sure that he\nunderstands the full picture before coming to a final recommendation.\n89\n\n90 Chicago GSB Management Consulting Group 1st Year Casebook 2004-2005\n• The candidate should be able to interpret the exhibits correctly.\nGreat Answer:\n• Candidate takes into consideration Puerto Rico’s status as a developing market and\nhits on the issue of consumer purchasing power as being central to the market\nopportunity.\n• Candidate makes the connection between declining prices and market saturation.\n• Candidate thinks of additional information that would help him make a better\nrecommendation (i.e. future GDP growth in Puerto Rico, market potential for value-\nadded wireless services, return demanded by the private equity client)\n• Candidate does total potential market calculation easily and adds in other variables to\nfine tune the number\n90\n\n91 Chicago GSB Management Consulting Group 1st Year Casebook 2004-2005\nExhibit 1\nWireless Service Penetration\nGDP Growth\n91\n\n92 Chicago GSB Management Consulting Group 1st Year Casebook 2004-2005\nExhibit 2\nWireless Service Price/Month\n$60\n$50\n$40\n$30\n$20\n$10\n1 2 3 4 5\nYears\n92\n\n93 Chicago GSB Management Consulting Group 1st Year Casebook 2004-2005\nExhibit 3\nCost Structure by Competitor\n$30\n$25\n$20\n$15\n$10\n$5\nAT&T Sprint Client\nVariable costs\nFixed costs\n93\n\n94 Chicago GSB Management Consulting Group 1st Year Casebook 2004-2005",

The company specializes in the manufacturing and\npreparation of high quality sauces. The client is based in the U.S and caters only to the\nU.S retail stores. The client has recently seen an increase in their volume of sales (by\n20%). However, their profits have declined by 10% in the same period\nCase Question\nThe client wants to address the following questions:\n• What is the cause for the decline in profits even though the unit volume increased?\n• What can be done to reverse this trend?\nQ&A Session\nRelevant Questions and Data (Wait to see if the student asks for this relevant\ninformation before giving it to them):\nLet the student ask all the important questions:\n• Revenue:\no Products sold: Pasta sauce, tomato sauce, and salad dressing\no Overall price change: None\no Channel sales (volume, price): Only retailers, no problems here\no Product mix change: None\no Competitive pressure: None\no Substitutes: No new substitutes or change in customer taste\no Market conditions: No problems here\no Quality: No problems here\n• Cost:\no Manufacturing cost: No change here\no Distribution cost (by channel): No change here\no Promotion cost: This has gone up!\nOther Relevant Information:\nPromotion cost is an important component of total cost in the food industry. The client\nstarted providing a $15 discount per product (across all products) for 40% of its products\nduring this period\n(For sake of simplicity, assume that all products are sold at the same price per case and\nthe discount is across all products)\n94\n\n95 Chicago GSB Management Consulting Group 1st Year Casebook 2004-2005\nRelevant Analysis and Answer Discussion\nData Table:\nScenario Before Promotion After Promotion\nTotal Volume (Units) 100 (hypothetical) 120\nPrice/product $100 $100 for 80 products\n$85 for 40 products\nCost $80 $80\nProfit $2000 (100*$100*0.2) $1800 [80*($100-$80) +\n40*($85-$80)]\nThe above table proves that with a 20% increase in volume, the profits dropped by 10%\n($200/$2000) due to the promotion cost.\nBreakeven Analysis:\n• If discount is offered for 40% of products, then the discount/product has to be\n$10/product (After promotion revenue = $2000 [80*($100-$80) + 40*($90-$80)])\n• If discount/product is $15/product, then the percentage of products for which the\ndiscount is given should be 26.66% (After promotion revenue = $2000 [93.33*($100-\n$80) + 26.66*($85-$80)])\nAnswer Analysis:\n• Identify that the promotion cost is the cause of the problem and prove the 10%\ndecline in profits\n• Ask the candidate to do the break even analysis. In the end this is the key part of the\ncase. Candidates have an opportunity to impress the interviewer here and drive\nthemselves forward by nailing the breakeven analysis in a confident and cool manner\n(all the while continuing to focus on relationship building with the interviewer).\n• Suggest ways to turn the situation around:\no Why is volume increasing only by 20% even though discount was given for\n40% of products? Is the promotion being implemented and advertised\neffectively? Is the channel taking away most of the discount such that the\nconsumer is not seeing a lot of it?\no Primary demand stimulation – make consumers consume more (new uses for\nthe products) or increase the number of time they use our product through ad\ncampaigns\nGood approach\n• Revenue-Cost approach is ideal for this case. Identify all the key revenue and cost\nbuckets and explore the promotion cost component in detail (promotion cost is key in\nthis industry)\n95\n\n96 Chicago GSB Management Consulting Group 1st Year Casebook 2004-2005\n• It is important to first prove the 10% decline in profits with the 20% increase in\nvolume.

This is a simple and homogenous component. This product\ncan be fitted in any car/make and it is an essential product with no substitutes in the\nmarket today. The client is doing OK. However, they are looking for growth\nopportunities.\nCase Question\nWhat opportunities should the client explore for growth? (They are looking specifically\nfor both Revenue and Margin growth – don’t say this upfront – see if the student asks for\nit and then give it to the student!). Ask the candidate to brainstorm around ideas for\nrevenue growth. Ideally, the candidate would come up with 4 or 5 good ideas.\nAfter identifying the opportunities, please explain the rationale for choosing these\nopportunities (or prioritize them) and list the ways in which we can execute these\nrecommendations?\nQ&A Session\nRelevant Questions and Data (Wait to see if the student asks for this relevant\ninformation before giving it to them):\n• Market:\no Size: 100M units\no Growth: Steady Growth (not relevant for case, but good question)\no Target Segment: Mainly after market (used and new)\no Geography: North America Only\nOne of the most critical factors for success in this business is efficient supply chain and\nstrong distribution channel.

One of them is for lowering blood pressure (BP) and\nthe other is for lowering cholesterol. The client is experimenting a new drug that is a\ncombination of these two drugs. They think this will generate more revenues in the near term.\nCase Question\nThe client would like you to help them with the following questions:\n• Is this a good idea?\n• If so, how should they price the new drug and what is its impact on the client’s revenue?\nClient and Product Background: (Good candidates will start this discussion before the\ninterviewer has to lay it out for them)\n• The client is an established player in the U.S market (focus of this case)\n• Both the drugs under consideration are prescription drugs and the new drug they are thinking\nof will also be a prescription drug\n• No additional cost was incurred in this combination drug and it has already received FDA\napproval\nQ&A Session\nRelevant Questions and Data (Wait to see if the student asks for this relevant information\nbefore giving it to them):\nClient has 50% share for both the cholesterol and BP drug\nSubstitutes: There are no other products like the combination drug in the market\nCompetition: One other competitor (50% share for both the cholesterol and BP drug)\nPatent: Available for ~10 years (for both the individual and combination drug)\nFollowing is the summary of survey of several doctors and HMOs (scale of 1 to 5 with 5 being\nthe best)\nClient’s New Client’s Current Portfolio Competition’s Current\nCombo Drug Portfolio\nCholesterol BP Cholesterol BP\nEfficacy 5 4 4 3.5 3.5\nUser Convenience 5 3 3 3 3\nDrug Interaction None Small Small Small Small\nSide Effect/Safety None Small Small Small Small\n# of Customers ? 40,000 50,000 40,000 50,000\nPrice to HMOs ? $40 $30 $40 $30\n• Consumers pay a co-pay of $10 per prescription (for 1 month worth of medicines)\n105\n\n106 Chicago GSB Management Consulting Group 1st Year Casebook 2004-2005\n• Also currently, 30,000 of the total 90,000 customers for both the client and competitor use\nboth the cholesterol and BP drug\nNote: User convenience is a measure of compliance or how often patients consume the drugs\nproperly on time. This is higher for the combo drug as it is only one pill compared to the current\ntwo pills. This is expected to cause the patients to take the proper dosage of both the pills more\nfrequently.\nRelevant Analysis and Answer Discussion\nPricing for the new combination drug:\nCurrent Scenario:\n• Consumers currently pay 2 * $10 = $20 co-pay for a month’s prescription of both the drugs\n• HMOs currently pay ($40+$30)-($20) = $50 to the client for a month’s prescription of both\nthe drugs\n• Client receives a total revenue of ($70*30,000) = $2.1M/month (from customers who buy\nboth drugs)\nCombo Scenario:\n• Since new drug is more effective and convenient than the current two drugs, customers can\nbe charged and are able and willing to pay $15 co-pay for a month’s prescription of both the\ndrugs ($15 is less than the current $20 co-pay customers pay for the two separate drugs) –\nGood candidates will ask if they are changes to pricing for the new drug or even speculate on\nit. If the candidate does not raise the issue then let them swim around for awhile to see if they\ncome back to it. Eventually, if they don’t ask then give it to them.\n• HMOs pay for combo drug = $50 for a month’s prescription of both the drugs (assuming\nHMOs do not pay more than before)\n• Cannibalization Effect: Assume all 30,000 customers who buy both the drugs will start\nbuying the new combo drug. Lost revenue = ($70-($50+$15))*30,000 = ($150,000/month)\nNew customers from competition\n• The client could potentially get a reasonable share of the competition’s 30,000 customers\nwho use both the drugs (because of benefits of the drug and the reduction in monthly co-pay)\n• Let’s say they get 50% of competitor’s customers: This translates to a revenue of\n($50+$15)*15,000 = $975,000/month\nNet impact on client’s revenue (Short-term)\n• Net direct impact is a revenue growth of $825,000 per month\n• In the long-term, there is potential to woo more competitor customers.\n• The above are strong positives but good candidates will point out that competition may make\nown combo drug and ask about if they have such a drug in the pipeline (they did but it failed).\nIn any event, the compeition is expected to eventually create a competitor drug. This will\ncause the advantage to shrink a little bit in the long-term.\nPotential Synergies:\n• Distribution (Sales force, Doctors, Pharmacies, Hospitals, HMOs): Well established (and the\nsame) network which can be used for the combo drug\n• Marketing and advertising: Current programs can be used to push the new combo drug to\nconsumers (currently, client has a very effective Direct-to-Consumer marketing)\nRight approach\n106\n\n107 Chicago GSB Management Consulting Group 1st Year Casebook 2004-2005\n• The student should identify the key entities in the industry value chain like doctors, HMOs,\nhospitals, and the end consumer (bringing in the government and state agencies is a bonus\nthough this is outside the scope of this case)\n• The next step will be to identify the feasibility of the idea which should include the key\naspects of drug efficacy, side effects, interactions etc\n• Finally, the student should try to estimate a price that the market will bear for this product.\nHere, the co-pay for end customers should be used properly. Also, the student should address\nthe cannibalization effect of introducing this new combination drug (very important) and its\nimpact on overall revenues\n• Bonus points: If the student mentions the benefits of increased compliance to the HMOs\n(because of reduced long-term costs to them) and consequently makes an assumption that\nthey may be willing to pay more than the current $50 for the two drugs together to the client.\n107\n\n108 Chicago GSB Management Consulting Group 1st Year Casebook 2004-2005",
  "Booth_2005_Brenner’s Wireless License Bid": "Brenner’s Wireless License Bid\nBackground\nThe Singapore government is rewarding an wireless licenses via a bid process. Mr. Brenner,\nSenior Vice President of Strategy and Sales Growth at Vodafone, i.e. your client, is considering\nwhether it should participate and bid for this license. Your job is to assess the attractiveness of\nbidding.\nFirst Question:\nMr Brenner would like for you to analyze the market opportunity.\nInformation – Note the candidate should ask for the following data specifically\nbefore getting it.\nMarket Size: Mobile use in Singapore is expected to increase 20% in 2004, 30% in 2005, 40% in\n2006 and 30% in 2007. There are now 2.4 million mobile users in Singapore. The average mobile\nuser spends $60 a month for a mobile phone.\nCustomer Acquisition: To enter the market the company projects that it will have to invest an\nincremental $100 million to acquire the first 200 thousand customers. 200 thousand subscribers is\nVodafones benchmark for a minimum threshold to enter a new market. Each additional 10\nthousand customers will require $1 million in advertising.\nCompetition: There are three players in the Singapore wireless telecom market who have 60%,\n30% and 10% of market share respectively.\nIndustry Economics: Industry EBITDA is 60%. The new license is expected to cost $100\nmillion.\nProject discount rate: 20%\nApproach\nThe candidate should do following:\nMarket attractiveness analysis:\n• Market Analysis – the size and growth of the market, profitability of the industry, etc.\n• Consumers analysis – Discuss what consumers value (i.e. features) and the types of services\nthey use. (there is no hard data on this point, rather the candidate should brainstorm with the\ninterviewer about consumers in general)\n• Competitor analysis – The candidate should recognize that the existing competition will\nreact to Vodafone’s market entry by offering more services, better features, better coverage,\nlowering prices, etc. In addition, the candidate should mention the importance of fully\nunderstanding the realm of possible strategies that will circumvent competitor reactions. This\ndoes not need to be specific, but this is analysis that will require further work.\nClient analysis – its ability to win in this market: The candidate should mention that cost\nstructure, core competencies, and competitive advantages of vodafone will be key as well.\n108\n\n109 Chicago GSB Management Consulting Group 1st Year Casebook 2004-2005\nHowever, they are not the issue at them moment, the candidate may assume that these are seen as\nsources of strength for us.\nEconomics of the bid –cost benefit analysis to see whether the client should attend the bid. This\nis the true the focus of the case. The candidate should realize this and focus on drilling down here\nand into the numbers given at the beginning of the case. The goal is to get a simple NPV of the\npotential project. Since NPVs are not common the interviewer should ask for it specifically but\nask for a rough estimate so the candidate doesn’t over-focus on the math.\nFirst consider the threshold investment. If the bid is profitable at threshold, then assume that it is\nalso profitable at added-in investment stage. If it is not profitable at threshold stage, then consider\nadded-in investment stage to see whether it would be profitable (it is good to start with threshold\ninvestment only because you do not need to consider the growth rate of the business for your\nNPV calculation – especially if you have not learned corporate finance yet at this stage, this will\nsave you a lot of trouble).\n(cid:131) Up-front investment: total $200 million (license $100 million + threshold investment\n$100 million).\n(cid:131) Cash inflow = $60.00 * 200,000 * 60% * 12 = $86.4 million (every mobile user spends $\n60*12 each year for mobile bills. Assume that you client is able to get 200 thousand\ncustomers. 200 thousand customers is less than 10% of current mobile users which is\n2,400 thousand. As the market is growing at 20%, acquiring 200 thousand customers\nseems reasonable for our client. EBITDA is 60%).\n(cid:131) NPV = $86.4M / 20% - $200M = $232M (Assume that the project could go on for ever,\nand that the competitors’ discount rate is 20%) – this is a quick and dirty way of doing\nNPV to get a sense of the numbers. Based on this; we should look deeper into this project.\nSecond Question\nWhat are the risks and why?\n1) 200 thousand customers – competitors will probably respond. However, as the current\nmobile-user market is growing at 40% and the current market has 2.4M customers. If our\nclient focuses on new customers, which is 2.4M*40% = 960 thousand it should be able to\nget 200 thousand customers.\n2) 60% EBITDA won’t change. This is not necessarily true either as with new entrants into\nthe market, the current players might cut price to maintain their market share. This could\ndrive down EBITDA.\n3) We assumed that the project would go on forever – there might be country risk – e,g,\nSingapore government decided to nationalize the mobile telecom market – though this\nrisk is small, but we should also consider\n4) We used the industry discount rate – which does not necessarily represents the risk of the\nproject for Vodafone.\nThird Question\nIf the current market share were not 60%, 30% and 10%, but 40%, 40% and 20%, which market\nis better for a new entrant? There is not an absolute answer to this, rather the candidate should\npick a market and defend his / her position.\nPotential answer:\n109\n\n110 Chicago GSB Management Consulting Group 1st Year Casebook 2004-2005\nThe 60-30-10 market is better for entrant as it is a more stable market than the 40-40-20\nmarket. In the 40-40-20 market, player have relatively same market share. There is no\ndominant player. Thus, players are more aggressive in acquiring new customers or\nstealing customers from other players to strengthen their position in the market. While in\nthe 60-30-10 market, there is an obvious industry leader and each player’s position is\nmore or less decided. Thus the market is more stable.\n110\n\n111 Chicago GSB Management Consulting Group 1st Year Casebook 2004-2005",
  "Booth_2005_Shah’s Stop and Save": "Shah’s Stop and Save\nNote to interviewer: please know this case well before giving to candidate. There is a lot\nof information here!\nBackground (read to candidate):\nSay: RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) is a new technology. It is a tiny system that\nconsists of wireless technology to transmit product serial numbers from tags to a scanner\nwithout human intervention. It is widely seen as the likely successor to barcode\ntechnology.\nOur client is Shop-N-Save, a discount consumer goods retailer (similar to Wal-Mart or\nTarget). They are investigating the possibility of requiring its suppliers to tag each\nproduct with RFID. Our client’s board requires that all major capital improvement\nprojects recoup all costs within 3 years or less. They have come to us to investigate this\nopportunity. Should we advise our client to pursue it? If so, what risks are there? If not,\nwhat alternatives can we investigate?\nCase path:\n1. Structure the solution\nHere is one possible structure, one that is probably overkill. Any structure that is able\nto address all relevant aspects of the issue is acceptable.\n- Cost/benefit\n- Supplier relationships\n- Consumer privacy concerns\n- Technology considerations and capital outlay\n- Internal change considerations\nThe main aspect of the structure for this case is cost/benefit. If they delve into other\nareas (i.e. privacy concerns), be aloof and mention you do not have data on that\nsubject. That should bring the candidate back to cost/benefit.\n2. Benefit/cost details\nCosts:\nCandidate may want to start with benefits first. Interviewer should direct them to\nstart with costs first. Costs are more interesting in terms of dissecting a graph,\nand for benefits interviewer can give candidate answers easily without requiring\ndiving into calculations if time is short.\nAsk candidate to brainstorm on what costs could occur. Let them generate 4-5\nideas, then ask which is likely to be the greatest and why. Then, dive into details.\nGive candidate “General Information” slide to refer to for cost discussion.\nSay: Let’s examine the cost of rolling out RFID to individual stores and DCs.\nOur client’s Strategic Planning Team worked closely with the IT department and\n111\n\n112 Chicago GSB Management Consulting Group 1st Year Casebook 2004-2005\ncame up with the following chart to determine how many receivers, which will\nread the RFID tags, to install in stores. (Show chart “Store Receiver Layout”).\n- What does this chart indicate? (Wait for answer; guide them if necessary).\n- With this, can you determine the cost of rolling out RFID receivers to stores?\n- What are you missing? (Let candidate compute; candidate should realize that\nhe/she is missing cost of receivers, wiring, and systems).\n- The cost of each receiver, including all wiring and systems, is $100 per\nreceiver.\n- Now, what is the cost of rolling out the receiver to all stores? (Let them\ncompute).\n- Expected candidate math:\n- First, compute number of receivers per 10,000 square feet Store space:\n4/low x 2 low + 10/med x 5 med + 20/high x 2 high = 8 + 50 + 40 =\n~100/10,000 sq ft.\n- Second, compute cost of receivers per Store: $100/receiver x (100,000\nsq ft / 10,000 sq ft) = $100,000/store\n- Third, compute cost of receivers in all stores: $100,000/store x 30\nstores = $3M\nSay: Now, let’s look at the DCs. (Show chart “DC Receiver Layout”) Let’s\nagain assume that the total cost per receiver, including all wiring and systems\ncosts, is $100 per receiver.\n- What is the cost of rolling out to all DCs? (Let them compute).\n- Expected candidate math:\n- First, compute number receivers per 10,000 square feet DC space:\n4/low x 3 low + 10/med x 5 med + 20/high x 1 high = 12 + 50 + 20 =\n~80 receivers/10,000 sq ft.\n- Second, compute cost of receivers per DC: $100/receiver x (400,000\nsq ft / 10,000 sq ft) = $328,000/DC\n- Third, compute cost of DCs in all stores: $328,000/DC x 3 DCs =\n~$1M\nSay: There will be an additional one-time cost of $8M for developing supporting\ncomputer systems and training, in the first year. In addition, the cost of yearly\nmaintenance will be $3M/year.\nExpected candidate math (Note: a great candidate will summarize costs this way\nbefore moving onto benefits):\n- One-time costs: $10M (systems & training) + $3M (receivers in stores) + $1M (receivers in\nDCs) = $14M\n- Yearly costs = $5M\nBenefits:\nAsk candidate to brainstorm on what benefits could occur. Let them generate 4-5\nideas, then ask which is likely to be the greatest and why. Then, dive into details.\n112\n\n113 Chicago GSB Management Consulting Group 1st Year Casebook 2004-2005\nThey should come up with some of the following answers. These are lumped into\nthree main categories. Feel free to group their suggestions into one of the\nfollowing, or say “that’s not applicable/relevant to this case” if not classifiable.\nNote: their framework may say Revenue/cost instead of Benefit/cost. If so, feel\nfree to tell them that the following benefits are effects on contribution to fixed\ncost, as opposed to revenue. They should realize that we are not dealing with\nrevenue directly in this case, but rather focusing on cost and on contribution.\n- Reduction in out-of-stock; Reduction in theft (both in-store and in\ndistribution).\n- Say: Sales are projected to increase 0.1%/year as a result.\n- Expected candidate math: Sales/store/year=$50M [from General Info]\nx 30 stores [General Info] = $1.5B/year sales x 0.1% = additional\n$1.5M/year contribution.\n- Better inventory management; Faster cross-docking distribution.\n- Say: There is a one-time savings of 5% on total inventory once the\ndistribution process has been re-engineered. Assume that this happens\nwithin the first year.\n- Expected candidate math:\n- First, compute total inventory: inventory = $1.5M/store x 30 stores\n+ $5M/DC x 3 DCs [all #s from General Info] = $45M + $15M =\n$60M\n- Next, compute one-time savings: $60M x 5% = $3M one time\ncontribution.\n- Note to interviewer: This is a really complicated calculation; if\nrunning out of time (esp. with 1/2 hour interview), feel free to give this\nnumber to candidate.\n- Reduced in-store and warehouse labor; Faster checkout in store.\n- Say: We expect a decrease in Store and DC labor cost of 5% per year.\n- Expected candidate math:\n- First, determine total store and DC labor cost: labor = $20K/store\nemployee x 100 employees/store x 30 stores + $20K/DC employee\nx 300 employees/DC x 3 stores [all #s from General Info] = $60M\n+ $18M = $78M ~= $80M/year (expect rounding)\n- Second, determine yearly cost decrease: 5% x $80M/year =\n$4M/year.\n- Note to interviewer: This is a really complicated calculation; if\nrunning out of time (esp. with 1/2 hour interview), feel free to give this\nnumber to candidate.\nExpected candidate math (Note: a great candidate will summarize benefits this\nway before moving away from benefit/cost):\n- One-time benefits: $3M (better inventory mgmt & faster cross-docking)\n- Yearly benefits: $1.5M (reduction in out-of-stock & reduction in theft) + $4M (reduction in\nlabor & faster checkout) = $5.5M\n113\n\n114 Chicago GSB Management Consulting Group 1st Year Casebook 2004-2005\nExpected candidate math (Note: this is expected, as it directly answers whether\nShop-N-Save should consider this proposal as-is):\n(All values in $Millions)\nYear: 1 2 3 4\nCost: 15 3 3 3\nBenefit: 8.5 5.5 5.5 5.5\nNet (year): -6.5 2.5 2.5 2.5\nNet (cumulative): -6.5 -4 -1.5 1\n3. Risks to accepting technology\nIf the candidate determined (through incorrect math) that the client should accept the\ntechnology as-is, they should begin to brainstorm risks. Here are some examples; the\nmore descriptive their risks, the less a math error should be held against them\n(especially if most of the math was correct):\n- Technology risk: RFID is a rapidly changing technology. If Shop-N-Save\nmakes a decision on one non-standard technology type, that type may be\nphased out of the market if a different type is chosen as a standard.\n- Budget risk: Massive projects are inherently difficult, and as a result the\nproject may surpass budget. Depending on candidate’s calculations, there\nshould be little leeway between recouping expenditures and not recouping\nexpenditures by year 4.\n- Assumptions risk: There were many assumptions that were made, that could\neasily be incorrect.\n- Growth/shrink risk: how do costs scale if company grows or shrinks?\n- Others: let the candidate be creative.\n4. Alternatives to proposed plan\n- Start small: instead of instituting a full rollout, stage the rollout based on\ngeography or sales category.\n- Distribution first, then retail: focus on implementing RFID for distribution as\nfirst phase of plan, then on retail enhancement for second phase. Two\nseparate phases will allow two separate periods to recoup expenditure.\n- Others: let the candidate be creative.\n5. Summary\n- Give the candidate 2 minutes to create summary and summarize at end of case.\nNote that, given 30 minutes, I do not expect anyone to finish case in full.\nEnsure that the candidate summarizes what has been discussed and gives a\nstrong statement as to whether he/she believes client should pursue.\n114\n\n115 Chicago GSB Management Consulting Group 1st Year Casebook 2004-2005\nShop-N-Save\nCandidate Slide\nRFID: Radio Frequency Identification.\n•\nWireless technology to transmit product serial numbers from\n•\ntags to a scanner without human intervention.\nLikely successor to barcode technology.\n•\nShop-N-Save: discount consumer goods retailer.\n•\nClient considering requiring suppliers to tag each product with\n•\nRFID.\nBoard requirement: All capital improvement projects recoup all\n•\ncosts within 3 years or less.\n(cid:198) Should we advise our client to pursue this opportunity?\n(cid:198) If so, what risks exist?\n(cid:198) If not, what alternatives can we investigate?\n115\n\n116 Chicago GSB Management Consulting Group 1st Year Casebook 2004-2005\nShop-N-Save – General Information\nCandidate Slide\n• 30 Stores and 3 Distribution Centers (DCs)\nStore Distribution Center\nFinancial\nSales/year $50M\nCOGS ($39.4M)\nTotal assets $3M $8M\nTotal inventory $1.5M $5M\nOperational\nSize 100,000 sq ft 400,000 sq ft\nSKUs (unique products) 50,000 225,000\n# of Employees 100 300\nAverage employee wage $20,000/yr $20,000/yr\n*Note: all values are average per Store or Distribution Center\n116\n\n117 Chicago GSB Management Consulting Group 1st Year Casebook 2004-2005\nShop-N-Save – Store Receiver Layout\nCandidate Slide\nThe following chart depicts the recommended RFID receiver\nlayout for a standard Shop-N-Save Store.

  "Columbia_2007_U": "Case 1: University Bank\nBACKGROUND\nFirm: Boston Consulting Group\nRound: 2007 Summer, First\nContent: Qualitative and quantitative\nCASE QUESTION\nIn Mexico banks prefer not to lend money to hospitals and schools because if one of these\ninstitutions defaults the Bank worries that it will be seen as the one responsible for\nliquidating their assets. We have a client who currently owns several universities. He is\nevaluating whether an opportunity exists to start a bank that would lend money to his\nvarious universities. There are three questions that he wants us to solve:\n- Is there an opportunity to lend money to universities?\n- If an opportunity exists, how big is it?\n- How should he structure the bank?\nINTERVIEWER BRIEFING\nRecommended approach: The purpose of this case is to test the interviewee’s ability to\ndetermine whether it makes sense for the client to open a bank that serves universities. In\nparticular, the interviewee should recognize that he/she needs to gather the necessary\ninformation to determine the market opportunity for such a bank. The interviewee should\nask questions to gather the necessary information to determine the market size.\nKey facts:\n- Population in Mexico is:\no 0-15 years old: 7 million\no 15-30 years old: 6 million\no 30-45 years old: 5 million\n- Total number of universities in Mexico: 200\n- Population growth: close to zero (use zero for the sake of simplicity)\nEXAMPLE DIALOGUE\nInterviewer: So, given the facts of the case, how would you consider going about\nanalyzing this question for the client?\nInterviewee: I’d like to understand a few things to evaluate this decision. First, I’d like to\nunderstand the size of the market to see whether there is an opportunity or not. Next I\n\nwould like to analyze who are the competitors, if any. In particular, I am interested in the\ncompetitors because they may decide to offer similar loans to institutions, like\nuniversities. Finally, I would like to know what the university can leverage from its own\noperations to develop this idea, etc.\nInterviewer: That seems like a good starting point. Let’s start by analyzing the market.\nHow would you do that?\nInterviewee: Ok, I will start by analyzing how many people go to university per year. If\nthe population grows at about 1% per year, this means that next year there could be more\npeople attending universities than space available. I would use a guesstimate of the\npercent of population enrolled in universities to calculate the number of students\ncurrently enrolled across Mexico. For simplicity sake I will assume that all potential\nstudents attend universities in Mexico, excluding the percent that attends school abroad.\nAge range Population % Enrolled in Enrolled In\nUniversity University\n(guesstimate)\n0-15 years old 7 million 0% 0.0 million\n15-30 years old 6 million 25% 1.5 million\n30-45 years old 5 million 2% 0.1 million\n1.6 million\nThere are roughly 6 million Mexicans between the ages of 15 and 30, and I would\nassume that they are evenly distributed. That is, there are 400,000 people in each year of\nage (e.g. 400,000 people who are 15 years old, 400,000 people who are 16 years old, and\nso on until the age of 30). If I assume that 25% of the people between the ages of 15 and\n30 go to university, that means we have 1.5 million students between the ages of 15 and\n30.\nInterviewer: Those assumptions seem to be very good ones. What else would you need to\nconsider?\nInterviewee: Ok, I think that I will need to figure out how many schools there are in\nMexico and how many students are enrolled in each school.\nInterviewer: Sure, our client has told us that there are 200 universities in Mexico and we\ncan assume there they are all at full capacity.\nInterviewee: Ok, so 1.6M divided by 200 means that there are 8,000 students at each\nschool. I might think that this seems like a high number. In the United States we have\npart-time students and full-time students. If this is similar in Mexico, the universities\nwould likely be able to accommodate more students without any investment.\n\nInterviewer: No, they can’t do that as the law prohibits it.\nInterviewee: Okay, so if the population grows at 1% per year and there are no new\npeople going to university for other reasons (e.g. better economy) this means that in any\ngiven year we will have 1.6M multiplied by 1% new students. We would have 16,000\nincremental students. Given that we know the schools are at full capacity, we would\nneed two new schools.\nInterviewer: Okay, so now let's focus on how would you segment the schools in order to\nthink about the credit scoring they may have?\nInterviewee: I would segment them based on:\n- New school or just new branch to an existing school. I believe that it is less risky to\nlend to a company that already has a business in place.\n- Flow of people to school: it's much more secure to lend to a school that has plenty of\nstudents in each year than to one that has the same number but distributed in a\ndifferent way (e.g. most of the people finishing their careers and almost nobody in the\nfirst or second year).\n- Geography: We are speaking in averages. There may be areas with no population\ngrowth. There may be an uneven dispersion.\nInterviewer: How would you calculate how much money a typical school would need?\nInterviewee: There are two different streams of costs we have to consider. On the one\nside the cost of building a new school – including buying the land, the construction, etc. –\nand the funds needed until the company reaches a state in which it has a positive free\ncash flow.\nInterviewer: Great. Tell me the number, or at least how to get it.\nInterviewee: The better is to rely on our client experience. He has 15 schools so there\nare some experiences we can leverage there?\nInterviewer: Let’s move on. How would you fund this project?\nInterviewee: I will think about a couple different ideas such as:\n- Unilateral organizations (e.g. World Bank, etc.)\n- The Government as it may need to help some private schools that focus on careers\nthat are not available through public university.\n- Banks: They may not be willing to do this on their own but may want to partner with\nsomeone that knows about this industry.\nInterviewer: Ok, fair enough. Our client is asking you to summarize the situation. What\nwould be your recommendation?\n\nInterviewee: Can I take a moment to recap all the findings?\nInterviewer: Sure.\nInterviewee: I will tell the client that it seems to be a pretty interesting opportunity to\nprovide capital to build new schools which would be at least two per year given the\ngrowth in the population.",
  "Columbia_2007_M": "Case 2: Mine in Chile\nBACKGROUND\nFirm: Boston Consulting Group\nRound: 2007 Summer, First\nContent: Operations\nCASE QUESTION\nOur client is a company which is going to exploit a mine that is expected to be full of a\nvery unique ore, and has asked us in which order his company should extract the ore from\nthe field. The ore will then be sent to a factory that his company already owns.\nINTERVIEWER BRIEFING\nRecommended approach: The interviewer is testing whether the candidate can identify\na useful algorithm to determine the best way to extract ore from this field. The candidate\nshould not initially waste any time developing one idea too fully; instead he/she should\ncome up with a few reasonable suggestions and test them for validity with the\ninterviewer. The candidate should, like in most cases, be aware that he/she is missing\ncritical information and should identify what he/she needs to solve the case and then ask\nthe interviewer for this data.\nKey facts:\n- The field is divided in cells of equal size. Once you blow one cell there is no way the\ntruck can pass through it to go to the factory.\n- This is a plan of the plant:\nFactory\nTrucks enter here with rocks\ncontaining 1% of ore.\nThe output is 100% ore\n\n- Each cell has different ore content and therefore each cell has a different cost of\nextraction.\n- No growth in population (for sake of simplicity).\nEXAMPLE DIALOGUE\nInterviewer: So, tell me how we might approach this problem for our client?\nInterviewee: First, I would like make sure that I fully understand our client’s needs. Let\nme repeat the key issues… Our client wants us to provide him with a recommendation\non what approach his team should take to extract the ore in order to maximize profits.\nInterviewer: Yes, that pretty much sums it up. So, what’s next?\nInterviewee: I can imagine a number of different ways of prioritizing which cells to take\nout first, such as:\n- Profit: Price – Cost.\n- Demand: Outlook of the price of the different types of ore. If the price is low\n(perhaps because demand today is lower), but we believe that this same ore will be\nsold for much more in the future (perhaps due to an increase in demand), it could\nmake sense to begin extracting lower concentration cells.\nI am imagining that this could be similar to the oil industry. Think for example about\nthe price of oil. The oil is in the field anyway so it’s better to exploit the places which\nthe least of it when the price in the market is at a low level. Unless, of course, we can\nstore the ore for long periods of time without a large opportunity cost by tying up\ncapital and space.\n- Capacity of the plant: Maybe there is a minimum level we need to provide to the plant\nas input. Maybe there is a maximum… this could determine how much we want to\nextract in any given time period, especially, if there are penalties for operating outside\nof this min-max range.\n- Operational issues: For example, if I dig a hole in the ground and the truck cannot\npass through that cell, it may be wise to start at the cells that are further from the\nfactory so that I do not block off routes.\nInterviewer: Ok, let’s assume that the points that you have raised are all reasonable.\nThis is a complex business and I was pleased to hear you touch on many of the important\npoints. But, first, let’s focus on profits. How would you define profit?\nInterviewee: Ok, in this case profits would be (price of a ton of ore) * (expected content\nof ore in cell) – (the cost of extraction for that cell). I will then rank each of the cells\nbased on its overall profit contribution and determine my extraction path from there. Of\ncourse, we need to consider that if we extract from one highly profitable cell, but it cuts\n\noff access to a lesser, but still profitable, cell, this is a cost of doing business under this\nassumption and should reduce my overall expected profits.\nInterviewer: Let’s assume that we map the field and this is what we get:\nCell 1\nx = 1.0\nC = 3\nCell 2\nx = 1.3 Factory\nC = 10\nCell 3\nx = 1.1\nC = 5\nx = tons of ore in that cell\nC = cost of extracting in that cell\nInterviewee: Do we have any information on today's price of ore?\nInterviewer: Yes, our client expects to get $10 dollars per ton of ore.\nInterviewee: So, for Cell 1 the profit will be: 1*10 – 3 = 7. For Cell 2 would be: 1.3*10\n– 10 = 3. For Cell 3 would be: 1.1*10 – 5 = 6. So I will start for Cell 1, then Cell 3 and\nfinally exploit Cell 2.\nInterviewer: Ok. What if price changes? Does it change your decision?\nInterviewee: Yes.\nInterviewer: Why?\nInterviewee: Let’s say price is now $30 per ton. For Cell 1 the profit will be: 1*30 – 3 =\n27. For Cell 2: 1.3*39 – 10 = 29. For Cell 3: 1.1*30 – 5 = 28. So I would recommend\nextracting Cell 2, then Cell 3 and finally Cell 1. This is based on the fact that the costs\nappear to be fixed and do not change despite the overall price fluctuations that we are\ndiscussing.\n\nInterviewer: Let’s move on. Our client has told us that per ton P&L statement is as\nfollows…wait, perhaps you could tell me how you would construct it?\nInterviewee: I would try to find out the average price, the average cost of goods sold and\nthen assign some part of the SG&A costs.\nInterviewer: Ok. Here are the figures that our client provided. What is the company’s\nbreak-even point?\nItem $ per ton\nRevenues 1.0\nCOGS 0.8\nSG&A 0.6\nProfit -0.4\nInterviewee: Ok. The company has $0.2 gross margin per ton of ore, before we factor in\nSG&A costs. So, if I divide SG&A by the gross margin I will find how much they have\nto produce. In this case, $0.6 / $0.2 = 3, which means they have to produce 3 times more\nto cover fixed costs.\nInterviewer: How the same P&L would look like?\nInterviewee: Basically, we have to divide the SG&A by 3. We are in essence spreading\nthe fixed SG&A costs across more units. However, we would need to make sure that\nSG&A does not increase with volume of ore extracted.\nItem $ per ton\nRevenues 1.0\nCOGS 0.8\nSG&A 0.2\nProfit 0.0\nInterviewer: Okay, can you summarize what we have identified?\nInterviewee: Sure. Our client was looking for a framework to identify the order in which\nhe should extract cells of ore from a field. We chose to focus on profitability as the main\ndriver. As mentioned, but not discussed in depth, profitability includes the core\ncomponents of price per ton of ore, cost to extract the cell (which appears to be fixed),\nbut also the cost of not being able to access a cell for extraction. Once we have\n\ncalculated the profits per cell our client can draw out a map to understand which cells to\nextract and when in order to maximize his P&L. Next we discussed the company’s P&L\nand identified that SF&A costs are relatively significant and appear to be fixed. This\nmeans that we would want to extract more ore in order to spread these costs across\nproduction and increase overall profitability.",
  "Columbia_2007_U (2)": "Case 3: UPS in Italy\nBACKGROUND\nFirm: McKinsey & Company\nRound: 2007 Summer, First\nContent: Quantitative\nCASE QUESTION\nThe CEO of a startup in a small village in Italy has hired McKinsey to help them decide\nhow many trucks to lease. There are different models available, but our client has been\ntold that he/she will need to have a consistent fleet (they can only lease one model type)\nand so we will also need to identify what model he/she should lease. This company\nprovides the local delivery of packages sent to this village through UPS next-day-delivery\nservice.\nLet me provide a quick overview of how the company operates: (i) They receive every\npackage at 5pm from UPS, (ii) a bunch of people then sort the packages and (iii) load\nthem on a truck where they are stored overnight, and (iv) then deliver them starting at\n9am for 10 hours. How would you suggest approaching the client’s problem?\nINTERVIEWER BRIEFING\nRecommended approach: This case tests a candidate's ability to analyze how many\npackages must be delivered and to see if the bottleneck is the time or the truck size. Not\nall information is provided up front to the candidate; he/she should be aware of this and\nmust identify additional data that will allow him/her to solve the case.\nKey facts:\n- Packages delivered per day: 1,000.\n- Dimension of package (envelope) is 1x1x1.\n- Operates five days a week.\n- It takes 8 minutes, on average, to deliver a single package and to be ready for the next\none (“assume they deliver one every 8 minutes”).\n- Truck A costs $150 per day and its dimensions are 3*4*5.\n- Truck B costs $40 per day and its dimensions are 9*2*1.\n- Truck C costs $130 per day and its dimensions are double the size of truck A.\n- Drivers, fuel, etc. are not considered and do not make a material difference to the\nanalysis (for sake of simplicity).\n- The case will include additional questions not addressed in the initial scope.\n\nEXAMPLE DIALOGUE\nInterviewer: So, how would you go about analyzing this problem?\nInterviewee: I’d like to understand a few things to evaluate this decision. First, I would\nlike to start by analyzing the demand. I would like to know how many packages we have\nto deliver and how long, on average, it would take us to deliver a single package. Then, I\nwould like to analyze the numbers in the context of the three truck models our client can\nlease.\nInterviewer: Ok. We can satisfy a demand of 1,000 packages / day and it takes 8 minutes\non average to deliver each one.\nInterviewee: So, 8 minutes per package / 60 minutes per hour * 1,000 packages / 10\nhours = 13.3 trucks. So we need at least 14 trucks. I would like to think about the leases\nwe can consider.\nInterviewer: Ok. Let me show you the information we received from the client:\nTruck Cost per day Dimensions\nA $150 3*4*5\nB $40 9*2*1\nC $130 6*8*10\nTruck A cost $150 per day and its dimensions (for the packages) are 3*4*5. Oh, by the\nway, you did not ask about the average size of an envelope, but our client has told us that\nthe average size is 1*1*1.\nInterviewee: Ok, so when assessing Truck A we multiply 1,000 (total packages for all\ntrucks) by 1*1*1 (average package size) and divide by 3*4*5. We will know how many\ntrucks we would need of the Truck A model. My calculations show 16.6 which would\nmean we would need 17 of this type of truck. As 17 is more than the time constraint of\n14 truck to ensure on-time delivery, we stick with 17.\nSo, this is the result of performing this analysis for each type of truck:\nTruck Cost per Dimensions # trucks # trucks Total cost\nday (rounded) (minimum) per day\nA $150 3*4*5 17 17 $2,550\nB $40 9*2*1 56 56 $2,240\nC $130 6*8*10 3 14 $1,820\n\nNow, from a pure financial analysis, I would recommend leasing 14 trucks of the C\nModel because it will allow our client to minimize the cost while ensuring on-time\ndelivery (customer satisfaction). On the other hand, we also might consider that there\nwould be plenty of room for delivering other things if they can figure out how in the\nfuture.\nInterviewer: Ok, it seems a good idea. Let’s move on. Now imagine 6 months have\npassed and your recommendation was pretty successful. Now the CEO want us to\ninvestigate any potential risks that he/she should be assessing/considering.\nInterviewee: Can I take a minute to organize my thoughts?\nInterviewer: Ok.\nInterviewee: So, I would like to go over this problem by analyzing both internal and\nexternal factors. Here there is a list of the things I would think about:\nInternal External\n- Need for extra drivers (e.g.: people get - Only one supplier (UPS) – we are captive\nsick) – do we have enough employees to UPS\n- Unionized drivers may shift labor cost - Adoption of new technology (e-mail)\nup in the future might reduce the need for sending\n- Need to lease more trucks because packages\ntrucks can break down causing late - Government regulation\ndelivery - New competition in the city – there are no\n- Insurance costs real barriers to entry, since UPS would\n- Extra fine tickets than forecasted likely partner with any carrier who can\nbecause drivers want to deliver on time deliver on customer service metrics at a\n- Etc. cheaper cost\n- No association with our brand, thus our\nsupplier can switch to our competitors or\nstart its own operation\n- Etc.\nObviously, I could analyze the sorting operation more to make a more profound\n(exhaustive) analysis but that was not covered on our initial discussion.\n\nInterviewer: Don’t go that direction. Let’s think of another scenario. Now we have to\ninvestigate sources for profit growth for this company with one restriction, we can\nneither add new truck leases nor change the existing ones.\nInterviewee: Ok. Let me think, about increasing revenues:\n- Extend hours: the trucks are already paid for the day, if we extend the delivery time\nafter 7pm we can deliver more of UPS or from other companies, even local\ncompanies. That would go (impact) directly to profits.\n- Different packages: we may recommend to UPS to sell different (more robust)\npackages to some clients and get part of it.\n- Pick packages: every time we leave a package we make space to pick a package and\ndeliver it to another part of the village or to give it back to UPS to send it to another\nplace\n- Get contract with a new operator: see whether we can deliver stuff to other company\nwho is in the delivery business but does not compete directly with UPS. Thought we\ncan not add new trucks we can think about utilization of current trucks\n- Advertisement: are the trucks painted with UPS logos? We can sell advertisement to\nthem or to other companies. Those trucks are all day in the street.\n- Insurance: offer insurance of packages to clients.\nInterviewer: What else?\nInterviewee: We can also think about streamlining operations (reducing costs). I would\nthink about them in terms of fixed and variable costs.\n- Evaluate the route of each truck to reduce time or usage of gas (fuel)\n- Improve technology usage in the sorting and loading packages. May reduce number\nof people at the factory\n- Re-negotiate leasing terms for trucks\n- Move warehouse to a cheaper place\nInterviewer: Ok, we are out of time, but thank you for the list of business challenges that\nthe client should assess, I am sure that some of these will lead to very interesting\ndiscussions.",
  "Columbia_2007_R": "Case 4: Refrigerators in India\nBACKGROUND\nFirm: McKinsey & Company\nRound: 2007 Summer, Second\nContent: Quantitative and qualitative\nCASE QUESTION\nA producer of high-end refrigerators in India has hired McKinsey to help him solve a\nprofitability problem. Two years ago the company had a record year in terms of growth.\nThough they were correct in understanding the size of the market and how it would grow,\ntheir gross profit decreased by approximately 70% and the CEO is very worried about the\nsituation. The client has asked us to identify what happened and what can be done to\nrestore profitability?\nINTERVIEWER BRIEFING\nRecommended approach: This is a typical profitability question. A good way to go\nover it is to break down the profit equation into the different concepts, build hypothesis,\nand test them.\nKey facts:\n- 800 million people in India\n- Two years ago units sales in India were 5 million and last year 6 million\n- The client’s company builds and sells high-end units\nEXAMPLE DIALOGUE\nInterviewee: Can I take a minute to think about this problem?\nInterviewer: Yes.\nInterviewee: Ok. I would start by breaking down the problem into revenues and costs in\norder to identify the potential drivers of the drop in profitability.\nInterviewer: Great. Let’s start with the costs.\nInterviewee: Ok. Given that we know that this market has been growing quickly, I would\nlike to know whether our client has decided to build a new factory to keep up with the\n\ngrowth. If that was the case, depreciation and amortization and interest on debt (if it was\npaid buy issuing debt) could be putting pressure on the profit of the firm.\nInterviewer: You are definitively right in your analysis, but I have to tell you that\nalthough they have built a new plant, there is no problem on the cost side. I can tell you\nthat since we have just finished another engagement in which we streamlined all his\noperations.\nInterviewee: So, now I would like to understand a little more about the revenue side of\nthe profit equation. Perhaps I could learn a little more about the market. I’m most\ninterested in having some assumptions to determine the size of the market.\nInterviewer: Sure. What do you want? If you ask for specific information I may have it.\nInterviewee: Ok, I would like to know the population of India, the number of households\nand what kind of refrigerators the client produces.\nInterviewer: Assume 800 million people and… I am not sure about households… guess\nsomething.\nInterviewee: I would say that there might be 5 people per household, which leads to 160\nmillion households. Based on my experience I will say people change their refrigerator\nonce every 5 to 7 years.\nInterviewer: Sounds reasonable, let's say 7 years.\nInterviewee: If I had the number of units sold in the market last year I would be able to\nunderstand how many people actually have refrigerators at home in India. Do we have\nany information around the percent of households that have a refrigerator?\nInterviewer: Last year sales were 6 million units and one year before they were 5 million\nunits.\nInterviewee: So,\nItem Quantity\nPopulation 800,000,000\n# per household 5\nHouseholds 160,000,000\nIncome # sold Years between change Market size\nTwo years ago 5,000,000 7 35,000,000\nLast year 6,000,000 7 42,000,000\n\nInterviewer: You are saying that the number of refrigerators for home-use was 35\nmillions two years ago and 42 millions last year?\nInterviewee: Yes. However, I might question whether the 7 million growth of last year\ncould have been in a segment not served by your client.\nInterviewer: How do you know that?\nInterviewee: Well, we concluded that there are 160 million households and from our\nestimation we get that only 42/160 = 26% have a refrigerator. On the other hand you\nmentioned that they produce high-end which may signal that the growth is coming from\nthe low income part of the society, for which your product may not be priced at a\ncompetitive level or even the product not designed for their needs.\nInterviewer: You are completely right. What we should do?\nInterviewee: There are several options. Our client can try to use the extra capacity they\nhave in the new plant to focus on building lower-end refrigerators, leveraging their\nsupplier relationships, dealers, etc. However, we would need to consider how to brand\nthese refrigerators so as to not detract from the quality associated with the higher end of\nthe market. They can think about exporting the extra capacity to other countries where\ntheir product offering is competitive and there is market for growth, they can start\noffering financing for this particular segment…\nInterviewer: Fair enough, let’s imagine that the marketing director came last night and\nproposed to reduce price by 20% to appeal to this segment, which he thinks will increase\nsales by 30%. Should we support him?\nInterviewee: Is that all the information we have?\nInterviewer: Yes.\nInterviewee: Let me think. Lets denote P = Price, C = Cost of goods sold, Q = Quantity.\nThe general formula to make this decision should be P*Q – C*Q > 0. In this case:\n80%*P*130%*Q – C*130%*Q > 0\n104%*P*Q – C*130%*Q > 0\nBreak-even point at:\n104%*P*Q = C*130%*Q\n104%*P = C*130%\n\n104%/130% = C/P\n80% = C/P\nCOGS of 80% over price does not seem to be completely out of what we would expect in\na manufacturing company. I would worry about COGS being just 25%, which will signal\nthat reducing price by 20% is not a good idea to attain 30% more sales.\nInterviewer: Thanks.",
  "Columbia_2007_M (2)": "Case 5: Mexican Dishes\nBACKGROUND\nFirm: A.T. Kearney\nRound: 2007 Summer, First\nContent: Quantitative\nCASE QUESTION\nA friend of mine has asked me to invest in his company, which makes dishes for the\nMexican market. He has mentioned that he is going to use my investment to purchase a\nnew manufacturing machine that he expects will allow him to double production. Should\nI invest in his venture?\nINTERVIEWER BRIEFING\nRecommended approach: Rather than jumping directly to analyze in depth the market,\nthe competition and/or the company’s capabilities, it is recommended that you use a\ndialogue to seek out more information. When mentioning the themes you would like to\ncover explain your reasoning behind each one.\nKey facts:\n- 110 million people live in Mexico. Assume 100 million for sake of simplicity.\n- Population growth can be approximated to be 1% per annum.\n- Income distribution: 5% of population top, 45% middle class, 50% bottom.\nEXAMPLE DIALOGUE\nInterviewer: So, should I invest or not?\nInterviewee: Ok, I would like to analyze three key areas that I expect will help me\nunderstand whether this is a good opportunity or not. I believe it is important to first\nanalyze the market, focusing on its size, growth potential and trends in terms of product\ndesign, then understand who are my friend’s key competitors and finally understand what\nthis company can leverage from its existing operations once the new machine is in place.\nInterviewer: Good idea. Let’s focus on the market for a moment. How would you go\nabout sizing it?\nInterviewee: There are a number of ways to do so. We can do some research and talk to\nyour potential partner to get some information. Alternatively, we can visit some of the\n\nstore or chains that sell that kind of product to build a market size from the bottoms up.\nFinally, we can estimate that number based on the population, etc.\nInterviewer: Ok, let's do the estimation based on the population. In Mexico there are\n100 million people. What else do you need?\nInterviewee: Do you have the income distribution pyramid of Mexico? I believe that\nincome will play a role because households with higher incomes may purchase higher-\nend dishes or may purchase different quantities than households at the other end of the\nincome distribution. I would also like to get a sense of the replacement rate, if not given I\ncan estimate…. And, whether there are any key substitutes that I can expect in the market\nin the next few years, to ensure that my estimates are fair.\nInterviewer: Assume income distribution is 5% of population top, 45% middle class and\n50% at the bottom. And, you can assume a 15% per year replacement rate.\nInterviewee: Ok. Let me quickly use these numbers to analyze the size of the market. I\nwill calculate first “the stock”, which is the size of the market given by the replacement\nof dishes. Then I will calculate “the flow”, which is the size of the new market.\nItem Quantity\nPopulation 100,000,000\n# per household 4\nHouseholds 25,000,000\nIncome # of different Sets Total # of sets Total # of sets (replaced)\nHigh 3 3,750,000 562,500\nMedium 2 22,500,000 3,375,000\nLow 1 12,500,000 1,875,000\nInterviewer: But… Are you sure that we can address the whole market?\nInterviewee: No, in fact this was only to calculate the full market size. I still wanted to\nask you which part of the market this company targets, is it within one income class?\nInterviewer: Okay, they target the medium segment, which by your calculations is of\nabout 3.4 million sets per year, among medium income households.\nInterviewee: Great. However, I would still want to understand the projected market\ngrowth. If the population growth at 1% per year we can assume that there are about 250\nthousands (25 millions * 1%) new houses per year, which 45% are of medium segment\nand they have to equip themselves with 2 sets… So there is an extra 225 thousands more\ndish sets demanded per year and a replacement rate of 15% on these new dishes. So, the\nmarket size is approximately 3.6 millions sets per year.\n\nItem Quantity\nPopulation 100,000,000\nGrowth 1%\n# per household 4\nHouseholds 250,000\nIncome # of different Sets Total # of sets (bought)\nHigh 3 37,500\nMedium 2 225,000\nLow 1 125,000\nInterviewer: On the ballpark, my estimation was that it was around 4 million.\nInterviewee: Anyway, we are still missing other segments on the markets such as\nrestaurants, hotels, offices, etc.\nInterviewer (interrupts): Don’t worry about that. Let’s continue with this.\nInterviewee: Okay, so now, we have to think whether it is convenient for you to enter the\npartnership. To do so I would like to do a break-even analysis of buying the machine and\nfigure out the amount of sets that we have to sell…\n[The interviewer interrupts again, since time is running low. Remember to practice good\ntime management in interviews and take cues from the interviewer]\nInterviewer: Assume that we have already done so and we figure out that we have to\nproduce at capacity (150,000 sets per year). We don’t have much time. What would\nyour recommendation be?\nInterviewee: So, given that the offer was to take the money to double production it\nmeans that you will go from 150,000 to 300,000. As this estimate represents less than\n10% of the available market, his proposal at first glance seems feasible. However, I\nwould want to know our current share versus those of our competitors in this segment. If\na competitor already had 70% of the market, I might be more cautious about entering into\nthis venture. Furthermore, if I had more time I would focus on what can be leverage\nfrom the current cost structure to assure it is a profitable proposition.",
  "Columbia_2007_C": "Case 6: Centralized Distribution\nBACKGROUND\nFirm: A.T. Kearney\nRound: 2007 Summer, First\nContent: Qualitative\nCASE QUESTION\nI was on the golf course the other day with a friend of mine who owns a chain of\nsupermarkets and he posed a question that is still on my mind. His question was, why\nshould he continue to centralize his company’s sourcing rather than split it to\nprocurement and distribution at the individual store level?\nINTERVIEWER BRIEFING\nRecommended approach: This is a pure conceptual case in which you have to come up\nwith a number of reasons to go one why or the other. Be creative in the way you think\nabout it, the case is open ended, but look for guidance from the interviewer if you start to\ngo too far a field.\nKey facts:\n- N/A\nEXAMPLE DIALOGUE\nInterviewee: Let me take some time to think about how to go over this problem.\nInterviewer: Sure, take your time. […] So, why should he centralize sourcing and\ndistribution?\nInterviewee: In order to come with an answer I would like to go over the pros and cons\nof centralizing and then weight them in order to come with an answer.\nInterviewer: Fine with me.\n\nInterviewee:\nPros Cons\n- Ability to “squeeze” suppliers by - Local people can understand better the\naggregating demand necessities (e.g.: because of format, size,\n- Flexibility to change what to deliver to place) for some (niche) categories\nindividual stores based on - If distributed directly to the store the cost\ndaily/weekly demand changes of distribution is paid by the supplier\n- Economies of scale in warehouse size, - There may be some products that are not\noperation, etc. bought at the centralized (HQ) level\n- Reduce cost of warehouse by having it because of limited size order. Managing at\nin a low cost area and not in the store, the store level make it viable\nwhich I assume is a high cost area - Etc.\n- Local people (at the store level) are not\ntrained to negotiate. Having them at\nthe store level is an extra cost\n- Etc.\nInterviewer: All good reasons… but I have talked to my friend about many of those\nthings and he keeps telling me that there may be something else. What could it be?\nInterviewee: So, we have covered most things and we are still not finding the reason…\nInterviewer: Yes.\nInterviewee: Looking at the ideas that I put in the pros vs. cons comparison, it could be\nsimilar to the notion of some products not being bought at the HQ because of some\nquantities asked for an individual store. What if the supplier refuses to ship to individual\nstores because of limited volume? He may not have the trucks to do so in such a small\nvolume or he may be unwilling to do so because is not profitable to do in that way.\nInterviewer: You got to the point. After a couple of hours in the golf course with my\nfriend I came to the same conclusion, which later he validated with his team as the main\nreason.",
  "Columbia_2007_H": "Case 7: Health Care in Canada\nBACKGROUND\nFirm: McKinsey and Company\nRound: 2007 Summer, First\nContent: Qualitative and quantitative\nCASE QUESTION\nOur client is a Canadian pharmaceutical company. Their first drug has just been\napproved by what is equivalent to the United States’ FDA and is an asthma treatment.\nThe client has hired McKinsey to help them assess what is the right price for this new\ntreatment and they will also need McKinsey’s help with completing an application to the\ngovernment for price approval. The second step is necessary because, as you may know,\nCanada’s government subsidizes healthcare costs and we will discuss this in greater detail\nlater in the case.\nINTERVIEWER BRIEFING\nInterviewees should consider what information will be necessary to address this case and\nask for data as they see fit.\n- Research and Development costs for this drug are estimated to be $5 billion.\n- Beyond R&D, marketing is the largest cost for a pharmaceutical. The\ninterviewer, however, will ask the interviewee to assume that marketing costs are\n$0 and there are no variable costs.\n- There are three segments to this market:\n1. Basic – 2% of the population – have a periodic asthma attack, use 1\ninhaler/month\n2. Serious – 2% of the population – use 1 inhaler/week\n3. Acute – 1% of the population – use 1 inhaler/week, but attack sometimes\nresults in hospitalization and death.\n- The client’s new treatment is classified as preventative. It is a pill that must be\ntaken every day.\n- Regular inhalers cost $10 each. This is the common treatment for asthma.\n- Acute patients that result in hospitalization spend 1 night/year in the hospital at\n$1000 and the rate of death is 1%.\n\nEXAMPLE DIALOGUE\nInterviewer: First, let’s discuss the possible ways of framing the client’s first question –\nhow should it price this new drug?\nInterviewee: Well, there are three different methods I can think of:\n- Cost based pricing – set the drug price at cost and add a percentage markup\n- Value based pricing – set it at what customers are willing to pay\n- Determine Minimum and Maximum prices\nInterviewer: Great, now, go through the steps to solve this problem and provide a price\nto the client.\nInterviewee: Okay, so let’s try cost based pricing. I would assume that the company has\nboth fixed costs and variable costs. Have we gathered any information from the client\nabout its cost structure?\nInterviewer: Well, what do you think would be its largest costs?\nInterviewee: Given what I know about the pharma industry and the extensive R&D for\ndrugs, I would guess Research and Development.\nInterviewer: Good, R&D costs are $5 billion. What would you guess are some other key\ncategories of costs?\nInterviewee: Marketing is usually a big cost.\nInterviewer: Right. For this case, let’s assume marketing is $0 and there are no variable\ncosts. [Where possible, the interviewee could have tried to anticipate this chain of\nquestions and suggested, without being asked, the key categories of costs that might be\nrelevant].\nInterviewee: Next I would want to size the Canadian market for this drug, assuming that\nwe will only sell in Canada. To do this, the population of Canada is approximately 30\nmillion people. We would now need to estimate the percentage that is asthmatics?\nInterviewer: There are 3 segments to this market:\nBasic – 2% of the population – have a periodic asthma attack, use 1\ninhaler/month.\nSerious – 2% of the population – use 1 inhaler/week.\nAcute – 1% of the population – use 1 inhaler/week, but attack sometimes results\nin hospitalization and death.\nAlso, the treatment is preventative. It is a pill that must be taken every day.\n\nInterviewee: Okay, so let’s assume every segment will use this drug. 30 million * 5% =\n1.5 million people. However, I would expect that there would be some barriers to\nswitching and not all potential users will switch from inhalers.\nInterviewer: Okay, so now how do you set the price?\nInterviewee: I want to determine the price to break-even. For a pharma, I think 5 years\nis acceptable.\nTo break even in 5 years: 1.5 million * Revenue = 5 billion (R&D)\nRevenue = $3,300\nUse 350 days/year for simplicity, one pill every day over 5 years = 350*5= 1,750 pills\n$3,300/1,750 pills = approximately $2/pill\nInterviewer: So do you think this price should be the minimum or the maximum?\nInterviewee: This is the minimum because it is the break-even price.\nInterviewer: Okay, let’s consider the second half of the question. As I mentioned, the\nCanadian government subsidized medical costs, let’s for the sake of this case say that it\npays back its citizens for medical treatments. How do you determine how to set the price\nso that the government will agree to pay it?\nInterviewee: Assuming that the government is paying for the current treatment, I would\nwant to know their current spend and determine what the difference is between that and\nthe new drug. Do you know how much the government is currently paying patients for\ntheir inhalers?\nInterviewer: The cost of inhalers is $10 each. Also, acute patients that result in\nhospitalization spend 1 night/year in the hospital at $1,000 and the rate of death is 1%.\nInterviewee: So I want to determine how much the government is currently spending on\ninhalers.\nBasic: $120/year (1 inhaler a month), 600,000 people, $72 million total\nSerious: $520/year (1 inhaler a week), 600,000 people, $312 million total\nAcute: $520/year (1 inhaler a week), 300,000 people, $156 million total\nTotal government is spending on inhalers: $540 million/year.\nNow I want to determine how much government is spending on hospitalizations.\n\n$1,000 * 300,000 people = $300 million/year\nTotal government spend = $540 million + $300 million = $840 million\nOver five years: $840 million * 5 = $4.2 billion\nSo with the new drug, we calculated the break-even at five years to cover $5 billion in\nR&D. With inhalers, in five years, the government is spending $4.2 billion.\nInterviewer: Good, so with this information, summarize for me the minimum and\nmaximum price.\nInterviewee: Summarize results to interviewer and state what you think the minimum and\nmaximum prices should be. Make sure to note that the new pill is a preventative\nmeasure, as opposed to the current method of using inhalers as treatment. A good\nsummary will be structured and go back through the steps used in solving the case. At\nthis point you can also bring in other parameters that may not have been discussed in the\ncase such as the price on-patent versus off-patent, or the potential larger international\nmarket for this drug.",
  "Columbia_2007_I": "Case 8: International Airline\nBACKGROUND\nFirm: Bain\nRound: 2007 Summer, First\nContent: Qualitative and quantitative\nCASE QUESTION\nOur client is a major international airline with flights to and from the Americas and\nEurope. The company already operates two daily flights from A to B, offering\nconnections to C. The CEO has hired Bain to evaluate a new route. Should they create\nthis new route from A to C?\nA\n1 = 4,800 miles\n2\n2 = 3,800 miles\n?\n3 = 2,350 miles\n1\nC\n3\nB\n\nINTERVIEWER BRIEFING\nRecommended approach: This is a typical Bain case. You can feel free to bring in your\nunderstanding of the airline industry as you see fit. This was a real case that the\ninterviewer had worked on during his time at Bain. Take the time to structure your\nthoughts and discuss the case.\nThe interviewer was expecting the interviewee to structure a framework, which would\nlook at the big picture that any MBA should have in mind about the airline industry. A\nstrong candidate would have to arrive into final numbers as well as in a final conclusion.\nSome important elements were:\n- First player in the market\n- Cannibalization and complementary business\n- Discuss trade-offs\nKey facts:\no At this point there is no other airline flying from A to C, and there is only one\ncompetitor flying from A to B. B to C is a domestic route with one competitor\no Market grows with GDP\no 15% of passengers from A to B (or return) have C as the origin or final destination\no Current Load Factor in A to B is 80%\no Ticket price to fly from A to B or A to C is $600 one way\no Aircraft type:\no Airbus 319 (120 seats) has a maximum fly range of 4,000 miles\no Airbus 320 (165 seats) has a maximum fly range of 6,000 miles\no Airbus 330 (240 seats) has a maximum fly range of 7,000 miles\no Costs:\no Airbus 319 (120 seats) has a fixed cost of $41,000\no Airbus 320 (165 seats) has a fixed cost of $62,000\nEXAMPLE DIALOGUE\nInterviewee: [Summarize the case and work on a framework]. This case requires us to\nestimate the potential market size of route A-C, the growth opportunity, the competition\nas well as our client’s resources. Also, any legal or governmental issue should be\ndiscussed.\nInterviewer: OK. How would you estimate the market size (demand) for this route? What\ndo you need to know? I have been working with this client for a long time and might have\nthe needed information.\nInterviewee: Although we could estimate the size of the market, it might be more\nreasonable to look at the current information the company has about the indirect route. I\n\nwould believe many passengers already fly from C to A by connecting flights in B, right?\nSo I would like to find out the number of flights per day, number of passengers per flight\nand the percent of these passengers that actually have C as the origin or destination.\nInterviewer: Very well thought. It is a smart decision to start more conservative. Our\nclient currently flies twice a day from A to B and back. It currently operates Airbus 320\nin this route, with 80% load factor. 15% of the passengers have C as the origin or\ndestination. I can also tell you some aircraft limitations:\n- Airbus 319 (120 seats) has a maximum fly range of 4,000 miles\n- Airbus 320 (165 seats) has a maximum fly range of 6,000 miles\n- Airbus 330 (240 seats) has a maximum fly range of 7,000 miles\nInterviewee: This gives us 165 * 80% = 132 per flight or 132 * 2 = 264 passengers/day\n(one way), of which 15% or 40 have C as the origin (and destination). We should have in\nmind that if the client offers the new route, it will reduce the load factor of the A-B route\nfrom 80% to 68%. Aside from our own cannibalization, I would expect that by offering\nthis new route our client will be able to take customers from its competitors, right?\nActually, does the client have any competition on its current routes?\nInterviewer: There is only one competitor flying from A to B, but this competitor has a\ncode-share agreement with a domestic airline that flies from B to C. From A to B the\ncompetitor flies an A330 (240 seats) daily with the same 80% load factor. Also, 15% of\nits passengers have C as the origin or final destination.\nInterviewee: This gives us an additional 240 * 80% * 15% = 30 passengers/day. Before\nwe conclude that our client will be able to steal these customers from the competition,\nlet’s analyze the pricing points. Do you have any information of prices?\nInterviewer: Both our client and the competitor charge $600/leg from A to B or A to C.\nInterviewee: It is interesting to see that the passenger pays the same fare to fly from A to\nB (4,800 miles) and from A to C (4,800 + 2,350 = 7,150 miles). So basically we have the\nsame price and potentially a faster trip. Unless we find any competitive advantage other\nthan travel time, we could assume our client is able to steal customers from the\ncompetitor. I would also imagine that by entering into this route our client would have\nfirst-mover advantage and the competitor would not enter this route if they didn’t think\nthat it could steal share from our client.\nInterviewer: This makes sense. Basically you have estimated a conservative demand.\nWhat else would you analyze?\nInterviewee: We know the potential demand; although there is an expected growth in the\nindustry let’s see whether this route would be currently profitable. What do we know\nabout the cost structure?\n\nInterviewer: The total fixed cost of operating A319 and A320 are $41,000/per flight and\n$62,000/per flight respectively. There are some variable costs, but they are marginal.\nInterviewee: Basically for route A-B the client must use an A320, but A319 is an option\nfor route A-C. Let’s analyze each route:\n- Revenues from A to B: (165 * 80% * 85%) * 600 = $67,320\n- Cost for A to B: $62,000\n- Revenues from A to C: 70 * 600 = 42,000\n- Cost for A to C: $41,000\nI am assuming the client could use the A320 for the main route and A319 for the new\nroute. As we can see, the former route will remain profitable (8%) and the new route will\ngive a 2.5% margin.\nInterviewer: What is your conclusion?\nInterviewee: Taking into consideration that 2.5% margin is not a very bad number for\nthe airline industry and that our assumption does not take into consideration an additional\ndemand generated by the new faster route from C to A, the client should at least launch a\ntrial of this new route. The former route, from A to B, will remain profitable.",
  "Columbia_2007_S": "Case 9: Seattle Newspaper\nBACKGROUND\nFirm: A.T. Kearney\nRound: 2007, Summer\nContent: Qualitative and quantitative\nCASE QUESTION\nOur client is a major media conglomerate, with radio stations, magazines and newspapers\nthroughout the US. They have five major newspapers in five important metropolitan\nareas. Its oldest newspaper circulates in the Seattle metropolitan area. After 50 years of\ngreat profitability and steady market, early this year there was a strong decrease in market\nshare and price.\nThe CEO has hired A.T. Kearney to help understand the new market dynamics and\ndetermine what strategy should be taken next. The CEO is also expecting us to provide\nadvice on whether he should increase prices. How would you go about addressing this\nquestion?\nINTERVIEWER BRIEFING\nRecommended approach: This is a typical case for which one single framework won’t\nbe enough. The interviewer was expecting you to look at the big picture and then start\nthinking about the profitability issue – both cost and revenue – and asking for specific\ninformation. A strong candidate would have to arrive at the following set of conclusions:\n- The new competitor targets a total different market from our client; this signals\nthat there is an additional market that our client could consider exploring.\n- The new sales price is below the cost per paper; however, our client should look\nat the potential for advertising revenues. These should subsidize the uncovered\ncost of each paper.\nKey facts:\n- Market Share: for over 50 years this Seattle newspaper had split the market (50-50)\nwith a strong, but independent local newspaper. The two are well recognized for their\nnews quality.\n- Earlier this year, another newspaper entered the market, building a 50% market share\nin less than nine months and leaving the two former newspapers with 25% market\nshare each. Although the two major newspapers had dropped their prices to match the\nnew entrant’s, this has not been enough to recapture the loss in market share. The new\n\ncompetitor is recognized as providing lower quality news than the former two\nplayers.\n- Newspapers generate revenues from sales of papers as well as advertisements.\n- There is a high fixed cost to operating a news paper, which might be classified as\nsunk cost.\n- None of the players offer subscriptions.\nBefore After\nClient Old Competitor Client Old Competitor New Competitor\nPrice $1 $1 $0.50 $0.50 $0.50\nDaily Sales 2,000 2,000 2,500 2,500 5,000\nVolume (units)\nMarket Share 50% 50% 25% 25% 50%\nDaily Ads ($) $ 2,000 $ 2,000 $ 2,000 $ 2,000 $ 0\nPages/day (units 40 40 40 40 20\nCost/page ($) $0.01 $0.01 $0.01 $0.01 $0.01\nDelivery Cost 40% 40% 40% 40% 40%\n(% of price)\nEXAMPLE DIALOGUE\nInterviewee: I’d like to understand a few things first in order to evaluate this market,\nespecially what, if anything, has changed from last year. To this end, I’d like to explore\nthe current market demand for newspapers in Seattle. Then, I’d like to understand the\ncompetitive landscape. Third, I’d like to discuss any changes to our client’s management\nor internal processes. Finally, since we’re dealing with a profitability issue here, I’d like\nto explore both the revenue and the cost side of the business.\nInterviewer: That was a long list of things. Where should we start?\nInterviewee: You said that there had been a decline in our client’s market share, so let’s\ntake a look at the competitive landscape. How has the market share of its competitors\nchanged?\nInterviewer: For over 50 years this Seattle newspaper has split the market with a strong\nbut independent local newspaper. The two are well recognized by their news quality.\nInterviewee: Do they still split the market?\n\nInterviewer: Early this year, another newspaper entered the market, capturing 50% of\nthe market in less than nine months and leaving the two former newspapers with 25%\nmarket share each. Why do you think that this happened, what factors are at play?\nInterviewee: The new competitor must be offering either a better product or a lower\nprice point. What do we know about the volumes and prices?\nInterviewer: These are the numbers. What do you think?\nBefore After\nClient Old Competitor Client Old Competitor New Competitor\nPrice $1 $1 $0.50 $0.50 $0.50\nDaily Sales 2,000 2,000 2,500 2,500 5,000\nVolume (units)\nInterviewee: Interesting, actually our client and the former competitor have increased\nsales volume with the entrance of a new competitor. I would imagine the new competitor\nis offering a different product or targeting a different market niche.\nInterviewer: That is correct. Although our client has dropped its price to match the new\nentrant’s – and the other major competitor is always following it – this has not been\nenough to recapture the loss in market share. The new entrant is recognized for offering\na lower quality newspaper. So, how would you explain that?\n[Interviewee should have noted the change in price and identified that this may be why\nthere has been an increase in demand]\nInterviewee: Well, there are some reasons that I can think of that might explain this\nphenomenon:\n- After the two major newspapers dropped their prices to match the lower price of\nthe new entrant, some of their readers could afford purchasing the two papers.\n- Alternatively, potential newspaper readers who could not afford the $1 newspaper\ncan now purchase newspapers at 50 cents.\n- The new competitor captured a new market niche, one that demands lower quality\nnews.\nSales revenue was 2,000*1 = $2,000 but now it is 2,500*0.5 = $1,250. This represents a\n37.5% decline in newspaper sales. I don’t think that a newspaper would have such a high\nprofit margin as to cover this decline, lets look at Profits = Revenue – Cost. To do this I\nneed to understand the per newspaper costs.\n\nInterviewer: Ok.\nBefore After\nClient Old Competitor Client Old Competitor New Competitor\nPages/day 40 40 40 40 20\n(units)\nCost/page ($) $0.01 $0.01 $0.01 $0.01 $0.01\nDelivery Cost * 40% 40% 40% 40% 40%\n(% of price)\n* There is a cartel for distribution\nInterviewee: Our client has 0.01*40 + 40%*0.50 = $0.60/paper in costs, which is greater\nthan the sales price of 50 cents. The new competitor, on the other hand, has 20*0.01 +\n40%*0.50 = $0.40/paper in costs, with a $0.10 margin over the variable cost per\nnewspaper. Are there any fixed costs we should be considering or are these considered to\nbe sunk costs? I would expect some heavy costs in this side.\nInterviewer: Yes there are, but they are sunk. However, I can tell you that our client is\nstill making a profit, despite the numbers that you just calculated. How would you explain\nthat?\nInterviewee: Besides paper sales, I would expect that a newspaper generates revenues\nfrom advertisements and online. We should also consider the balance between\nsubscribers and newsstand sales. Do you have any information?\nInterviewer: Yes. Neither our client nor its competitors offer subscriptions. They do not\nhave online news either. Let me give you the ad revenues. Any thoughts?\nBefore After\nClient Old Competitor Client Old Competitor New Competitor\nDaily Ads ($) $ 2,000 $ 2,000 $ 2,000 $ 2,000 $ 0\nInterviewee: Clearly the new competitor has not impacted the two former players’\nadvertisement revenue. It has also not been able to generate any revenue with ads. How\ncome? I also would want to consider that with the expanded customer base, why there has\nnot been also an increase in advertising, since I would imagine advertisers pay per reader.\nInterviewer: Usually companies split their budget of ads among the different means of\ncommunication that reach out to their target customers. So?\nInterviewee: We can conclude that the new competitor has created a new market\nsegment.\n\nInterviewer: That is correct. So, you have a meeting with the CEO in five minutes, what\nwould you recommend him to do? What will be your strategy?\nInterviewee: I will tell him that he should raise the price, perhaps back to $1. Some\nreasons:\n- The new competitor is not a direct competitor; it has created a new market niche\nof people who cannot afford to pay $1 and reads a totally different kind/quality of\nnews.\n- A price of $0.50 is not feasible in the long run for any of the players due to the\nhigh fixed cost.\n- As our client already mitigates the high fixed cost, the CEO should think about\ncreating a new product (newspaper) focused on this new market niche. The new\nproduct should be totally independent and oriented to this market. In the worst\ncase scenario they would make money out of printing (5,000 * 0.10) but could\ncertainly convince its advertisers to direct part of their budgets to the new product.",
  "Columbia_2007_J": "Case 10: Jumbo Jet\nBACKGROUND\nFirm: Booz Allen Hamilton\nRound: 2007 Summer, First\nContent: Qualitative and quantitative\nCASE QUESTION\nOur client is a large European airplane manufacturer that is developing a new jumbo jet,\nwhich will be able to hold up approximately 800-900 people. Parts for the plane are\nmanufactured in multiple sites across Europe. They have provided us the following\ninformation on site production:\n- Cockpits are produced in Northern Spain\n- The fuselage is produced in Northern Germany\n- Wings are produced in Northern England\n- Landing Gears/Interior are produced in Southern France\nThe client has asked us to determine where it is most economical to assemble the plane.\nINTERVIEWER BRIEFING\nCandidate should form a structured approach to investigate the components that make up\nassembly, including costs and capabilities.\nEXAMPLE DIALOGUE\nInterviewee: Well, I would like to look into the specific costs incurred from the\nassembly process and also determine the capabilities for assembling the planes across\ndifferent locations (labor skill and supply, etc.).\nInterviewer: Ok, I like your approach. Let’s focus on costs for now.\nInterviewee: Great. I assume that the major costs of assembly would be transportation,\nlabor, and PP&E. Also, I would think that there would be tax incentives to assembling in\none country versus another.\nInterviewer: Good. Let’s focus on transportation and labor for now, as these are the\nmost significant cost drivers. What are some of the areas that you might analyze for\npotential assembly locations?\n\nInterviewee: I would look at the existing sites where our client manufactures parts, as\nwell as other areas in the region that may have low cost propositions, such as Eastern\nEuropean countries that may have cheaper labor costs than Western Europe.\nInterviewer: Let’s take France as one location since it is the mid-point of the four\nmanufacturing locations and compare it to the Czech Republic where labor is\nsignificantly less expensive than Western Europe.\nInterviewee: Well the location in France would incur less cost because the client would\nalready have the landing gears and interior at the facility, and would have to transport the\nother three parts over a shorter distance. However, the labor costs in France would likely\nbe significantly higher than those in the Czech Republic. Do we have any information\nabout transportation and labor costs in each of these areas?\nInterviewer: Well, we have determined that labor accounts for about 70% of the total\ncosts of assembly and transportation accounts for the other 30%. Disregard the other\ncosts such as real estate, etc.\nInterviewee: Great. Well, since labor accounts for 70% of the cost, let’s start there. Do\nwe have any details about how much labor costs in the Czech Republic relative to\nFrance?\nInterviewer: Labor in France is 1.5 times higher than labor in the Czech Republic. What\ndo you think that total transportation costs would be in France relative to the Czech\nRepublic?\nInterviewee: Since these parts are so large, I would assume that a major part of\ntransportation is actually packing and loading the pieces on a truck.\nInterviewer: You’re right. In fact, the marginal cost of each extra mile transported is\nclose to zero. The most significant cost incurred is labor costs associated with the\nloading of parts for transportation.\nInterviewee: I would assume that the landing gears and interior are fairly small and\nwouldn’t incur as large expenses for loading/unloading compared to the wings or the\nfuselage.\nInterviewer: You’re right. In fact, the interior and the gears are the easiest to pack of all\nthe four parts and the fuselage is the hardest (most expensive). What would you\nrecommend to our client?\nInterviewee: Well, I would recommend they assemble the plane in the Czech Republic.\nSince labor accounts for 70% of the total cost, and the labor in Czech Republic is about\n35% less expensive than France, the client would save a significant amount of money,\n\nassuming that the skill level is constant across the two locations. Additionally, the\ntransportation costs would not be lower in France since the majority of transportation\nexpense is incurred by loading/unloading the parts and the interior/gears are the easiest to\npack. It might be worthwhile to analyze Germany as a potential assembly location\nbecause the fuselage represents a significant portion of our transportation costs. The\ntransportation savings may balance out the higher cost of labor in Germany (as compared\nto Eastern Europe).\nInterviewer: Excellent. One last question – our client knows the demand will be 200\nplanes per year and they are trying to determine how large an assembly facility they\nshould build. How would you go about figuring this out?\n[Candidate should ask for this data]\n- It takes 9 months to assemble one plane\n- One plane requires a space of about 300 ft x 300 ft\nInterviewee: Well, we know that it takes .75 of a year to produce one plane, so we need\nspace to produce 150 planes in the facility (200 x .75). Also, one plane requires 90,000\nsq. ft. of space. So the total facility would need to be 150 planes x 90,000 sq. ft. per\nplane = 13.5M sq. ft.\nThe interviewee will now be asked to summarize high level findings and make a\nrecommendation to the client regarding where it should produce and assemble planes\nand the requirements for this operation.",

If there is any excess\ncapacity, our client would like Booz Allen Hamilton to suggest a course of action to\nensure they are profitable and efficient.\nThe client currently has plants in both Minnesota and Mexico, close to the Texas border.\nThe plants manufacture similar products and the facilities are about the same size. The\ncompany expanded capacity by replicating their first plant (using it as a template for\nothers).\nINTERVIEWER BRIEFING\nCandidate should formulate a logical structure (internal vs. external factors,\nsupply/demand, etc.) and then determine if the client has excess capacity or not.\nInterviewer does not offer the necessary data and so the interviewee should ask directed\nquestions to extract the following data:\n- Each plant operates an 8am – 5pm shift\n- Demand is flat or declining\n- Client has a relatively high market share of 80%\n- Customers are phone companies and there are high switching costs\n- Our client recently acquired a competitor and there are very few players in the\nmarket.\n- The client is not highly concerned about new entrants because the industry growth\nis flat or declining, this is not an attractive market.\nEXAMPLE DIALOGUE\nInterviewee: I would start by looking into the company’s manufacturing process to\ndetermine if they are experiencing low utilization rates compared to the overall capacity\nof production.\n\nInterviewer: The company operates an 8-5 shift and is running at fairly close to 100%\nutilization rate. However, they have considered shifting to multiple shifts in each plant\nand running a 22-hour workday. What do you think the overall demand capacity looks\nlike in this particular industry?\nInterviewee: I would assume that it is either flat or declining because the US telecom\nmarket is relatively saturated, with little new customer growth.\nInterviewer: Yes, that’s correct.\nInterviewee: Ok, well, I would now like to investigate the overall market and determine\nwhere our client sits in the industry. Do we have any information about their market\nshare?\nInterviewer: They have a relatively high market share of 80%.\nInterviewee: Who are they supplying the products to? Consumers, business customers,\nor phone companies?\nInterviewer: They are a telecom infrastructure manufacturer so their direct clients are\nthe phone companies.\nInterviewee: Does our client have any reason to believe that the market share could\nchange dramatically? What are the switching costs in this industry?\nInterviewer: There are very high switching costs in the industry. Also, our client recently\nacquired a competitor so they are not anticipating any big declines in market share.\nThere are also only a few competitors in the industry with little threat of new entrants due\nto the flat or declining growth.\nInterviewee: Given the overall macro trends in this industry as well as their specific\nmanufacturing set-up, I believe that our client does have excess capacity?\nInterviewer: Why?\nInterviewee: Well, the industry is declining and there is less demand for these products\nover time. Also, opportunities exist to streamline their manufacturing operations with\nmore shifts per plant across less overall plants.\nInterviewer: Ok. What should they do?\nInterviewee: They could close some existing plants, or they could generate revenues\nfrom manufacturing products for competitors (or for companies with similar products).\n\nInterviewer: Looking at the first option, how would you determine which plants to close?\nInterviewee: I would look at the overall cost per unit at each plant and determine which\nwould result in the most efficient overall location. Costs could be classified into major\nsubsets such as labor, distribution (from Mexico vs. Minnesota). I would also want to\nknow if quality of product differs across any of the plants. Finally, it would be valuable\nto analyze whether our client could change their plant size and configuration to generate\nfurther efficiencies.\nInterviewer: Good. Quality is fairly consistent across all of the plants and they are not\nlooking into plant reconfiguration at this point. Labor costs are the most significant\ncontribution to cost per unit. Given that, what do you recommend?\nInterviewee: I recommend our client closes the Minnesota plants and increases overall\nutilization of the plants in Mexico by adding shifts.\nInterviewer: What are the major risks/concerns of this recommendation?\nInterviewee:\n- Negative PR resulting from closing US plants\n- Scalability issues (can the Mexican plants quickly increase capacity?)\n- Quality issues stemming from increased production\n- Reliance on one location/region for all manufacturing",

A strong candidate\nwould:\n- Discuss market dynamics (local and international and supply/demand).\n- Discuss the expected competitive response to any action, e.g., a price war.\n- Summarize all findings in a presentation format.\nKey facts: All given beforehand, but the following would help in the discussion:\no An efficient plant should have a 1,000,000 ton capacity (but, not all plants are\noperating efficiently), however, from this information the interviewee should be\nable to assume that therefore competitors are operating more than one plant each.\no Market grows with GDP.\no There is a strong demand for this product internationally.\no The competitors are probably located away from the coast, adding transportation\ncosts.\nEXAMPLE DIALOGUE\nInterviewee: [Summarize the case and work on a framework]. In this case it is important\nto look at the competition (specifically, understand the different cost structure of the 3\nproducers), estimate the market demand and discuss the international trade environment.\nWe should also discuss the specifics of a metal commercialization.\nInterviewer: OK. Where should we start?\nInterviewee: Clearly, our client is running on full capacity, but its competitors appear to\nhave some idle capacity. Furthermore, I note from the data provided that the competitors’\ncost structures allow them to sell in the international market while our client does not\ncurrently export any of the products. Our client would experience zero margin if it was\nto export since the international price is given at $450 which is equal to our client’s cost\nof production. Nevertheless, the local price is considerably higher than the international\nprice, so the producers would rather sell as much as possible in the local market. Given\nthis information, I would hypothesize that there is not enough demand in the local\nmarket.\no Competitors would prefer to sell in the local market ($600/ton) instead of export\n($450/ton)\no Competitors are running with idle capacity, but we know that demand exceeds\ncurrent supply\nInterviewer: That is correct. But what about the international market?\n\nInterviewee: This is a good point. You did mention that there is a strong demand\nworldwide. Now we have to find out why the competitors are not selling their full\ncapacity. We can think of many possible reasons. Geographical distance, transaction\ncosts, transportation costs, export taxes, etc.\nInterviewer: They all make sense, but as we see competitors are able to export some\nmetal, right?\nInterviewee: Competitors might have operations abroad so it makes easier to export to\ntheir international facilities. Or they might produce part of their capacity close to harbors.\nConsidering that the international price is much lower than the local one, I would expect\nsome barriers for international trade.\nInterviewer: That is correct, Brazil does have some taxes for foreign products and\nproducers struggle with transaction costs. Let’s look at the cost structure. Why do you\nthink there is a difference in costs?\nInterviewee: I could consider geographic location, technology, economies of scale,\nsupply chain synergies, etc.\nInterviewer: You mentioned some important elements. Our client has only one location\nand the competitors have multiple plants, each in the countryside. Our client was the first\nplayer in this market, having built its facilities 10 years earlier than its competitors. The\nindustry has realized that a plant must have a minimum of 1,000,000 capacity in order to\nbe efficient.\nInterviewee: But our client is still making a lot of money, right?\nInterviewer: Yes, enough to convince the CEO to invest in a new production facility.\nThis would be a $400M investment in year 0 for a capacity of 1,000,000 tons with a cost\nof $420/ton. How would you evaluate this investment if this new production would be\ntraded in the international market? Would you recommend this investment?\nInterviewee: Basically the margin will be $30/ton ($450-$420) * 1,000,000 equal to\n$30M per year. By using a 10% discount rate this investment will generate $300M in\ntotal. The $400M investment would not be worth it.\nInterviewer: That is true. So, are you going to advise him not to make the investment?\nInterviewee: I would advise him against it unless he is willing to engage in a price war.\nInterviewer: That would be the minimum price he could go to turn this investment\nprofitable?",
  "Columbia_2006_Bank Increasing Market Share": "Case 1: Bank Increasing Market Share\nBACKGROUND\nFirm: N/A\nRound: 2005 Summer, First\nContent: Mainly qualitative\nCASE QUESTION\nOur client is a major diversified financial services firm. They have 4 lines of business:\n• Checking Accounts\n• Savings Accounts\n• Loans\n• Mortgages\nThe bank is profitable, but the CEO is on a mission to increase overall market share while still\nmaintaining profitability. He is considering increasing his sales force to accomplish this.\nThere are 3 different categories of sales force he can choose to change:\n• Branch Managers\n• Telemarketers\n• Mortgage Agents\nThe CEO has come to us for advice on whether or not he should increase his sales staff, and if\nso, where he should be adding heads. How would you go about addressing this question?\nINTERVIEWER BRIEFING\nRecommended approach:\nA thoughtful and complete answer to this case involves discussing the overall market\nenvironment, with a look at the competition in the marketplace and the current market share\nbreakdown. The interviewee should realize that there are 4 separate markets for distinct products\nthat have different profitability characteristics. It becomes apparent that investing in some lines\nof business will pay off for the company more than investing in others. From there, a discussion\nof the economics of each of the different sales channels will drive you towards a\nrecommendation.\n1. Determine the competitive position of the company\n• What is the competitive position of the company in the overall market?\n2. Assess the importance of the different lines of business\n• Where does the bank play? What is its strategy? How does it make its money?\n\n• What is our market share in each line?\n• What is the importance of each line to the overall business? How do the different\nlines fit into the overall strategy? Which are the most profitable? Are there any loss\nleaders?\n• What can the company expect to achieve from investment in each line?\n3. Understand the impact of the different categories of sales force\n• Which lines of business will be affected by increased investment in each category?\n• What is the expected ROI for each category?\n4. Formulate an investment strategy for the bank to follow\nKey facts:\n• The market is made up of 5 major players. They are all very similar, offering\ndiversified services and playing in all 4 segments.\n• Market share is defined on a % of customers basis. The market shares are as follows\n– the #1 player has 20% market share. We are the #2 player and have an 18% market\nshare. The rest of the industry is somewhere between 15%-18%.\n• The market share within each of the segments does not break down in this same\nfashion. Everyone is profitable and established and no one is pricing their products\nirrationally.\n• The company’s share by segment is as follows:\no Checking Accounts – 21%\no Business Accounts – 20%\no Loans – 23%\no Mortgages – 10%\n• Profit per transaction is as follows:\no Checking Accounts - $5\no Business Accounts - $20\no Loans - $100\no Mortgages - $1,000\n\nSales Force Profitability\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\nBranch Managers Mortgage Agents Telemarketer\nSales Category\nytilibatiforP\nExisting Customers New Business\nEditor’s note: The chart above depicts the profitability of different types of sales agents with\nregard to the mortgage business. “Profitability” of each individual sales agent is defined as the\nincremental $ profit margin (in $K) each brings in. Telemarketers clearly bring in the most\nprofit margin $s in aggregate, but mortgage agents bring in the most from new business.\nEXAMPLE DIALOGUE\nInterviewee: Before we start, I would like to clarify what a mortgage agent actually does. Can\nyou walk me through that?\nInterviewer: The mortgage agents work by having relationships with real estate brokers. When a\nbroker makes a sale, he refers the buyer of the home to a mortgage agent. That agent works with\nthe home buyer to close the transaction and sell the mortgage.\nInterviewee: That makes sense. I’d like to figure out what the current market situation looks\nlike. How many players are there and what is the breakdown in terms of market share? Is\neveryone profitable? Are there any new players? Any new trends like internet banking?\nInterviewer: The market is made up of 5 major players. They are all very similar, offering\ndiversified services and playing in all 4 segments. The market shares are as follows – the #1\nplayer has 20% market share. We are the #2 player and have an 18% market share. The rest of\nthe industry is somewhere between 15%-18%. However, the market share within each of the\nsegments does not break down in this same fashion. Everyone is profitable and established and\nno one is pricing their products irrationally. There are some new trends emerging such as\ninternet banking, but they are not a factor at this point, and the CEO is not worried about that.\nInterviewee: I see. Do we know how our market share breaks down in each of the different\nsegments?\n\nInterviewer: Yes, we do. Our breakdown by segment is as follows:\n• Checking Accounts – 21%\n• Business Accounts – 20%\n• Loans – 23%\n• Mortgages – 10%\nInterviewee: That is interesting. Is there a different profitability level for each of the different\nsegments?\nInterviewer: Yes, there is. As a matter of fact, profitability per transaction is as follows:\n• Checking Accounts - $5\n• Business Accounts - $20\n• Loans - $100\n• Mortgages - $1,000\nInterviewee: I would like to explore a few more possibilities, but first, I want to just say that\nmy gut instinct is that we can increase our sales force, and I think that we should do it in the\nmortgage agent area.\nInterviewer: That is a good insight. Why do you think that is?\nInterviewee: Based on the existing market shares, it seems like we have the most room to\nimprove our business in this area. Additionally, given the parity between the competitors in the\nindustry overall, I think it would be very difficult to dramatically increase share in any of the\nother areas. Therefore, we should concentrate on the mortgage market. From there, we need to\nsee what part of the sales force will have the greatest impact on this market. Do we have any\ninformation on the profitability of each of the salespeople and how much new business each arm\nbrings in?\nInterviewer: Yes, the CEO has given us this exhibit:\n\nSales Force Profitability\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\nBranch Managers Mortgage Agents Telemarketer\nSales Category\nytilibatiforP\nExisting Customers New Business\nInterviewer: What does this chart tell you?\nInterviewee: This shows that telemarketers are the most profitable place to put our money in\nterms of increasing our sales force. How are they generating these profits? What are they\nactually doing?\nInterviewer: They call up existing customers to get them to renew their old services.\nInterviewee: I see. In that case, it looks like my initial hunch was correct. Since the other 2\nsales forces will increase profits based on existing customers, the mortgage agent is where we\ncan drive market share growth by winning new customers. In terms of making an overall profit,\nthe telemarketers would be the right way to go. However, since the CEO has explicitly stated that\nhe wants to increase market share, mortgage agents are where he should be bulking up the sales\nforce.\nInterviewer: Thank you. Out of curiosity, can you give me an example of where adding branch\nmanagers might be a good decision? What would you need to look at?\nInterviewee: We could do a study of each branch to see how many customers come through the\ndoor and how many of them are existing customers versus potential new customers.\nInterviewer: OK. Let’s say we did that and we found out that in each store, there are 4 branch\nmanagers and they, on average, service 40 potential new customers that come through the door\neveryday. What would you have to look at when deciding whether or not to add more branch\nmanagers?\n\nInterviewee: I think you would have to look at whether or not the existing 4 managers can\nhandle 10 new customers per day. If they can handle that amount of customers, then there is no\nneed for more managers. In that situation, if we were to add a 5th manager, each manager would\nthen be responsible for 8 new customers on average, but that would just create idle time and not\ngenerate any new customers. If however, there are long waiting times and potential new\ncustomers are getting fed up and leaving, then perhaps adding new managers would make sense.\nInterviewer: What else could change that could cause the bank to want to add more branch\nmanagers?\nInterviewee: If you can drive additional potential customers through the door. Perhaps a\nchanging trend in the market will create a new opportunity, i.e. adding a new product that may\ndraw in more non-customers who are interested in becoming a customer or a new advertising\ncampaign that is drawing in more people. In any of those types of scenarios, it may make sense\nto add additional branch managers.\nInterviewer: I think that makes a lot of sense. Thank you very much.",
  "Columbia_2006_Chinese Cars": "Case 2: Chinese Cars\nBACKGROUND\nFirm: Roland Berger\nRound: 2005 Summer, First\nContent: Market sizing, qualitative and quantitative\nCASE QUESTION\nOur client is a large Chinese conglomerate with a lot of cash on its hands. They decided to\ninvest this money in a plant that, by the end of this year, will have a full production capacity of 8\nmillion aluminum wheels annually. Management assumes that it will be able to sell 20% of its\nproduction in the domestic Chinese market.\nThe company hired Roland Berger to determine if it can sell the remaining 80% of its production\nto the US market, which is the largest vehicle market in the world. What do you think?\nINTERVIEWER BRIEFING\nRecommended approach:\nThis case is essentially asking you to do two things:\n1) Determine the size of the US car market so that you can understand the relative impact of the\nChinese company’s goals.\n2) Assess the feasibility of entering the US market and provide suggestions on how this\ncompany might go about doing so.\nMarket Sizing: Determine how many wheels your client could supply to the US market – both in\nnumber of wheels and number of cars (1/4 of the wheel number). Then ask about the size of the\nUS new car market and the secondary market to determine what share the company would need\nto capture to sell 80% of its production in the US.\nFeasibility and Possible Actions: This is where you need to drill down to uncover automobile\nindustry dynamics:\n• How do OEMs get the wheels for the cars they produce?\n• How would a Chinese company distribute its wheels to the US market? Directly or through\nintermediaries?\n• How entrenched are supplier relationships? Do OEMs buy based on price only, or do the\nrelationships matter too?\n• What regulations are involved in supplying an OEM?\nOnce you understand how the supplier-OEM relationships work, you can provide some\nsuggestions on how this company might feasibly enter the US market.\nKey Facts:\n\n• 17 million vehicles produced in the US each year. 70% equipped with aluminum wheels.\n• 10% of used car owners whose cars are less than 5 years old buy aluminum wheels\n• 85 million cars in the “after market,” 24 million of which are less than 5 years old\n• Most companies will select one supplier who will supply the aluminum wheels for the\nentire life-time of a car model. Suppliers are usually selected 24 months before a new\nmodel goes into production and have stringent quality controls.\nEXAMPLE DIALOGUE\nInterviewee: Okay. I’d like to first determine the production figures of the Chinese manufacturer\nand compare them to the size of the total US automobile market. This will help me understand\nthe relative size of the Chinese company’s production numbers and whether their plan is\nrealistic. Once I know how much market share the Chinese company wants to capture, I’d like to\ndiscuss the US automobile industry dynamics to determine if/how the Chinese company should\nenter the market.\nLet’s start with their production numbers. Let’s assume that cars require only 4 aluminum wheels\nand that spare tires are made out of some less expensive material. This means that your client\nproduces wheels for 2 million cars per year. 80% of 2 million gives us wheels for 1.6 million\ncars, which we are trying to sell in the US. So how big is the US new car market and how large is\nthe secondary market (people who buy aluminum wheels for an older car)?\nInterviewer: About 17 million vehicles are produced in the US each year. About 70% are\nequipped with aluminum wheels. About 10% of used car owners whose cars are less than 5\nyears old buy aluminum wheels.\nInterviewee: That means that roughly 12 million new cars each year are sold with aluminum\nwheels. Can we assume that there are about 280 million cars in the after-market, about 1 car per\nperson, considering that people in New Jersey own on average 2 cars?\nInterviewer: No, that number is much lower. There are about 85 million cars in the after\nmarket, but only about 24 million are less than 5 years old.\nInterviewee: I see. That means the after-market is about 2.4 million sets of aluminum wheels\nper year. Considering that your client needs to sell 1.6 million sets, they’d have to capture a 66%\nmarket share, which seems very unlikely in such a fragmented market. That means we should\nprobably focus on the new car market. How do the major car companies procure the aluminum\nwheels they put on their cars?\nInterviewer: That’s a good question. Most companies will select one supplier who will supply\nthe aluminum wheels for the entire life-time of a car model. Suppliers are usually selected 24\nmonths before a new model goes into production and have stringent quality controls.\nInterviewee: We probably would have to add another 12 months to even get on a company’s\npreferred supplier list, which increases the lead time to about 3 years before we can hope to\n\nsupply aluminum wheels to a major US car manufacturer. Since you mentioned earlier that your\nclient’s plant will be ready for production by the end of this year, this does not look like a viable\noption either. What about trying to expand distribution on a broader basis than just the US?\nInterviewer: They thought about that as another option, but they would really like to work with\njust the US.\nInterviewee: Assuming that your client can produce quite a bit cheaper in China than most\ncompetitors can in the US, it might make sense to sub-contract some of this production capacity\nto suppliers of the major US car manufacturers. This is probably less lucrative than selling\ndirectly to end-customers or car manufacturers because the client would have to share its profit\nmargin with the supplier. That said, it would probably be the most efficient way to enter the US\nmarket on a large scale.\nInterviewer: Yes, this is exactly what they did.",
  "Columbia_2006_Health Insurance": "Case 3: Health Insurance\nBACKGROUND\nFirm: Booz Allen Hamilton\nRound: 2005 Summer, First\nContent: Qualitative and quantitative\nCASE QUESTION\nA health insurance company experienced a loss of $40M this year, after recording a $40M profit\nlast year. They have hired us to determine the cause(s) of this decline and identify potential\nsolutions.\nThe company is in only one line of business, Commercial Risk Insurance, in only one region.\nThey have several direct competitors.\nTheir cash flows originate from premiums, which are paid in on a periodic (e.g. monthly, semi-\nannually, annually) basis by its customers, and claims are paid out to the customers’ caregivers\nas appropriate.\nFor the sake of simplicity, the company’s Profit = Premiums – Claims.\nCurrently this company has 4 million members, which equates to a 40% market share.\nAll revenue, cost and profit figures are measured on a per-member basis.\nHow would you go about identifying potential solutions for their decline in profitability?\nINTERVIEWER BRIEFING\nRecommended approach: This is a typical profitability case, with the addition of a problem-\nsolving section to discuss the area that is hurting profitability. First, you should hone in on what\nis causing the company to lose money. Look at revenues (price X quantity) and costs (fixed +\nvariable costs). This will lead you to the crux of the problem. At that point, you should ask\nquestions that explore the problem and identify ways to address it.\nKey facts:\n• Revenues have been stable from last year to this year. Premiums charged per member\nhave been stable at an average of $200/year, and membership has been flat at 4 million\nmembers.\n• The company has made no large recent capital expenditures\n• Per member variable costs are rising by $20/year. This is largely the result of a decline in\nutilization of resources due to poor management\n• Within the company’s structure, there are several functional groups:\n\no New Admits\no Pre-authorizations\no Case management\n• These groups are staffed with MDs and RNs that used to be in the field treating patients.\nThey are now responsible for managing hundreds of doctors and nurses that are currently\ntreating patients. They are more used to working in practices of 5-10 professionals and\nunaccustomed to managing such a large staff, causing problems in controlling referrals\nand unnecessary testing/procedures.\nEXAMPLE DIALOGUE\nInterviewee: Since we’re dealing with a profitability issue here, I’d like to explore both the\nrevenue and the cost side of the business. Starting with the revenue side, have the premiums\ncharged changed over the last year?\nInterviewer: No, they have been stable. Incidentally, premiums are charged at an average of\n$200/year/member.\nInterviewee: Has the member base been stable? The reason I’m asking this is to understand\nwhether revenue as a whole has been stable.\nInterviewer: The member base has been stable, so revenues have as well.\nInterviewee: OK. Since revenue is stable, I’d like to explore the cost side of the business. First,\nlet’s take fixed costs. Have they made any large capital investments to spur growth?\nInterviewer: No. They aren’t in a growth stage and haven’t made any large capital expenditures\nexcept for a new claims payment system two years ago. In general, this is not a capital intensive\nbusiness.\nInterviewee: That makes sense since it is a service company. So let’s look at variable costs. Has\nthe cost of servicing members been growing?\nInterviewer: Yes. Per member costs are rising to the tune of $20/member/year. Why do you think\nthis is happening?\nInterviewee: The cost of care may be going up – on the doctor, equipment or medicine front.\nInterviewer: The biggest cost driver is actually utilization, i.e. how frequently the doctors use\nother sources for a patient’s care. So now I’d like you to derive the total variable costs that the\ncompany had last year versus this year.\nInterviewee:\nProfit = Revenue – Costs\n$40M (last year) = (4M members * $200/year/member) – Costs\n\n$40M = $800M – Costs\nCosts = $760M last year\nProfit = Revenue – Costs\n-$40M (current year) = (4M members * $200/year/member) – Costs\n-$40M = $800M – Costs\nCosts = $840M current year\nInterviewer: What were the variable costs on a per member basis for each year?\nInterviewee:\nPer Member Variable Costs = $760M last year / 4M members = $190/member/year\nPer Member Variable Costs = $840M current year / 4M members = $210/member/year\nInterviewer: Good. Let’s talk about utilization now. What might affect this measure?\nInterviewee: It could be a change in what MDs want to prescribe. For instance, maybe they are\nmore risk-averse because of a rise in malpractice cases, so they are more frequently seeking\nsecond opinions. Another thing that might affect utilization is how well the company manages\nthe MDs.\nInterviewer: To your second point, what would you look for within the company to see where the\nproblem resides?\nInterviewee: I would look at several things, including strategy, skills of the MDs, shared values,\nstaffing, technology used, leadership system and functional organizational structure, to name a\nfew.\nInterviewer: OK. What would you want to know about the organizational structure?\nInterviewee: I’d like to know how the company is structured.\nInterviewer: Within the company’s structure, there are several functional groups:\n• New Admits\n• Pre-authorizations\n• Case management\nThese groups are staffed with MDs and RNs that used to be in the field treating patients. They\nare now responsible for managing hundreds of doctors and nurses that are currently treating\npatients.\nInterviewee: Are those MDs and RNs used to managing large groups of people (i.e., many\ndoctors in the field)?\nInterviewer: No, they are more accustomed to working in practices of 5-10 professionals.\n\nInterviewee: Makes sense. What types of people compose the upper management of the\ncompany?\nInterviewer: They are also MDs that used to be in the field. What’s your hypothesis about this\nproblem and potential solutions at this stage?\nInterviewee: The problem seems to be in the management of the doctors and nurses that are\ntreating the patients. Due to the difficulty in getting all necessary data, and the fact that the staff\nmanaging those doctors/nurses is not used to managing a large, remote organization, variable\ncosts (specifically the costs associated with utilization) have risen. I would recommend\nreviewing the current information systems for a way to consolidate the view of data for each job\nfunction so that everyone has all the necessary information to manage their cases. They should\nalso consider providing leadership/management training for those who are responsible for case\nmanagement.",
  "Columbia_2006_Italian Paper": "Case 4: Italian Paper\nBACKGROUND\nFirm: Bain\nRound: 2005 Summer, First\nContent: Qualitative and quantitative\nCASE QUESTION\nOur client is an Italian paper manufacturer. They make high-end glossy and matte paper that’s\nused in corporate brochures, magazine ads for Gucci and Prada, etc. It’s a commodity product.\nThey have one factory that produces 150,000 tons of paper a year. 90% of this is sold into the\nItalian market, which gives it about a 20% market share. The other 10% is sold outside of Italy.\nThey would like to build another factory to produce another 150,000 tons a year. This would\ncost $100 million. They would like us to tell them whether or not this is a good idea.\nINTERVIEWER BRIEFING\nRecommended approach: This case is asking you to determine whether it makes sense to build\nadditional capacity, i.e. can your company be profitable in the future based on this investment?\nThis will depend on the current and future market dynamics, which can be explored in a number\nof ways.\nHaving the Three Cs in your head will help you ask the right questions:\n• Customers: Who are they? Is there enough market demand for additional capacity?\n• Competitors: Who are they? Where are they? What market share do they have? How are\ntheir prices relative to ours? Can we capture any of their share?\n• Company: How much will this additional expansion cost the company, and what will the\nbenefits be? Does this fit with the company’s current plans?\nKnowing the answers to these questions will then help you determine whether it makes sense to\nadd capacity. You can also probe whether a new factory is the right way to go, or whether it\nmight be more feasible and profitable to add capacity to an existing plant, acquire another\ncompany, etc.\nKey facts:\n• The Italian market will continue to grow at about 10%. Germany is very hot and growing\nat about 15%. Other Eastern European markets are growing as well.\n• Your largest Italian competitor has 40% share. An international competitor has 10% and\nthe other 30% is fragmented among small players.\n\n• There are about 12 players and only 2 paper machine manufacturers in Europe. Everyone\nknows what everyone else is doing and nobody else is investing in additional capacity\nright now.\nEXAMPLE DIALOGUE\nInterviewee: I’d like to understand a few things to evaluate this decision. First, I’d like to\nexplore the current market demand for paper. Then, I’d like to understand the current players in\nthe market and how our company competes against them. Finally, I’d like to talk about the\nspecifics of the investment proposed and what the NPV might be for that option versus others.\nI’ll start with the market demand in Italy. You mentioned that 135,000 tons is about 20% of the\nItalian market, which means that the Italian market is 675,000 tons. What are the projected trends\nfor Italian market growth?\nInterviewer: Well, how would you go about finding that out?\nInterviewee: I might look at historical trends, but those are probably not that accurate because of\nthe growth of the Internet. To get a more accurate picture of where the industry is going, I would\ninterview the client’s customers, i.e. publishers, printers and ad agencies. I would ask them how\nthey see their business prospects, what they are investing in now, what they want to invest in\nlater, etc.\nInterviewer: OK. Through this, you discover that the Italian market will continue to grow at\nabout 10%. Your largest Italian competitor has 40% share. An international competitor has 10%\nand the other 30% is fragmented among small players.\nInterviewee: Interesting. So that means the Italian market could only absorb an additional\n67,000 tons - not an additional 150,000 tons. It might make sense to look beyond Italy depending\non the industry dynamics. What is the greater European market demand?\nInterviewer: Well, Germany is very hot and growing at about 15%. Other Eastern European\nmarkets are growing as well.\nInterviewee: Great. Who are the major competitors in those markets and what kind of share do\nthey have?\nInterviewer: There are about 12 players and only 2 paper machine manufacturers in Europe.\nEveryone knows what everyone else is doing and nobody else is investing in additional capacity\nright now.\nInterviewee: Are they not investing because they don’t see opportunity, or because they don’t\nhave the resources?\nInterviewer: It’s not clear.\n\nInterviewee: Turning to the investment angle, how quickly can we make back the money on the\ninvestment in the new plant?\nInterviewer: I don’t know the specifics, but it wouldn’t take very long. What would you advise,\nknowing what you know now?\nInterviewee: While I don’t have all the information I would like, it seems that the European\nmarket could absorb the demand and since the competitors are not investing in additional\ncapacity, this could be a great opportunity for the client to make inroads into a new market and\nincrease revenues. Besides the new factory, they may also want to consider other growth options,\nsuch as building new capacity in an existing plant or acquiring a competitor.",

The hospital is a large hospital\nproviding a full range of services, in a large, urban area. In the last five years, the hospital’s\nprofitability has decreased to the point that they are almost out of money and will not be able to\nmeet their financial and social mission.\nThe revenue scheme of the hospital’s different services falls into the following three categories:\n1) Fixed fee for service (e.g. broken leg = $150 to fix)\n2) Cost plus (cost of providing the product/service plus a percentage)\n3) Per diem fees (fee per day of hospital stay)\nThe hospital gains patients through physician referral. In other words, the physicians within the\nhospital see patients and after diagnosing those patients will refer the patients for care, treatment,\nsurgery, testing, etc. to other places within the hospital.\nThe CEO comes to you to ask the following:\n1) Why has profitability gone down?\n2) How should they turn it around?\nINTERVIEWER BRIEFING\nRecommended approach:\nThis is a profitability problem, so plan to drill down on Revenues (price and quantity of patients\nor patients/ services at the hospital) and Costs (fixed and variable costs per patient.)\nAsk about the economics of the case:\n• How does the hospital make money? (Paid in the revenues structures given by HMO,\ninsurers, and state agencies above. This is given upfront in the case description and is a\nbit of a red herring in the case.)\n• Who pays the costs? (Again, the costs are paid by the HMOs, insurers, and state\nagencies)\n• How do patients come into the hospital? (Patients come in through referral from the\ndoctors that work in the hospital or through emergency services. This is helpful\ninformation to get in solving what is going on with revenues in the case. When one\nsegments the products/ services in the hospital, one should think about patient/ service\nsegments, or patient/ doctor segments.)\n\nAfter receiving this information, focus in on the following:\n• How many more people would you be able to see if you reduced patient stays on average\nby 1 day?\n• What would the effect on costs be for reducing patient/ days by one day on average?\nHow would that affect profitability?\nKey facts:\nThere are several patient/ service segments in the hospital. The following are a few examples:\n1) Women in Labor/ Giving Birth- Low profitability, High referral rates/ word of mouth,\nvolume declining, fixed fee rate with high variability in length of stay\n2) Pediatrics- Low profitability, high referral rates/ word of mouth, volume declining, fixed fee\nrates\n3) Males (age 25-50)-Medium profitability, medium referral rates, volume stable, Per diem and\ncost+ rates\n4) Elderly (65+)-High profitability, low referral rates, volume increasing, fixed fee rates\nQuantitative work in terms of cost:\nFixed costs: $1000/ patient\nVariable costs: $500/ patient/ day\nAverage length of patient stay: 10 days\nPatients seen per year: 1000\nEXAMPLE DIALOGUE\nInterviewee: This is a profitability case, and profitability is composed of revenues and costs. In\nterms of which side of the hospital’s profitability I’d like to start with, unless costs have changed\nin some significant way because of a recent capital expenditure....?\nInterviewer: No, they’ve had no new costs.\nInterviewee: Right, then I’d like to start with revenues and see if there have been any recent\nchanges on the revenue side.\nInterviewer: Sure, that sounds like a good place to start.\nInterviewee: So, revenues are composed of two things: price times quantity. Have the prices\nthat the hospital charges for services that it provides changed recently?\n\nInterviewer: No, prices haven’t increased or decreased in any considerable way—other than\ngeneral increases along with inflation.\nInterviewee: Okay, so, it’s a problem with the number of patients, or number of patient/\nservices, along different segments then.\nInterviewer: Yes, you’re right. What do you hypothesize is happening?\nInterviewee: I imagine that there are several patient, or patient/ service, segments within the\nhospital.\nInterviewer: That’s right.\nInterviewee: Is the hospital a full-service provider, or do they specialize in some sort of area, or\nservice?\nInterviewer: Nope, the hospital is a full-service provider.\nInterviewee: So, I hypothesize that more profitable and/ or higher revenue generating patient/\nservice segments are decreasing.\nInterviewer: Interesting. There are 4 principal segments:\n1) Women in Labor/ Giving Birth- Low profitability, High referral rates/ word of mouth, volume\ndeclining, fixed fee rate with high variability in length of stay\n2) Pediatrics- Low profitability, high referral rates/ word of mouth, volume declining, fixed fee\nrates\n3) Males (age 25-50)-Medium profitability, medium referral rates, volume stable, Per diem and\ncost+ rates\n4) Elderly (65+)-High profitability, low referral rates, volume increasing, fixed fee rates\nWhat do you think this data tells you?\nInterviewee: Well, first, I would prioritize the segments in terms of how important they seem to\nour current inquiry: I would put the third segment aside because the volume has stayed stable,\nand I would concentrate on the first two segments for two reasons: 1) Their volume has been\ndeclining, and 2) These segments reflect high word of mouth and long-term patient segments that\nare likely to keep coming back to the hospital for other services for a long time if they like the\nservice that they get there (as opposed to the elderly segment, which represents a diminishing\ngroup of patient/ services because of their age).\n\nInterviewer: Good, good. And what would you want to do in order to reverse the decline of\nthose segments?\nInterviewee: I would probably want to do some research into why those segments’ volume is\ndeclining. Has service quality declined? Have the number or quality of pediatricians or\nobstetricians at the hospital declined? Has another hospital in the area begun to specialize in\npediatrics and obstetrics that is making this patient and patient/service volume decrease in these\nspecialties?\nInterviewer: Good, good. One last question: would you abandon the fourth segment (elderly)\npatients completely. They are a highly profitable segment. How would you deal with them?\nInterviewee: They are a highly profitable segment, which is a bit strange, as they have a fixed\nfee rate revenue structure and their length of stay can vary tremendously. I would try to segment\nthem further into patient/ service segments that were a little more predictable along the\ndimension of how long they stay—this might yield a much more profitable and predictable\npatient/ service type than what they currently have.\nInterviewer: Right, so there might be some 20% of those patients that are staying longer and\ndriving down profitability for the rest?\nInterviewee: Yes, and a more detailed segmentation might show that. So they’d be able to\ntarget and get the more profitable of those patients.\nInterviewer: Good, good. So, that pretty much covers the revenues side. Now, suppose that I\ntold you that you told you that we went to the CEO with all of this interesting info about\nrevenues and revenue generation by targeting different segments, but the CEO said that they\nreally thought it was about the number of patients that the hospital can see and the costs and\ncost controls. How would you think about costs?\nInterviewee: Well, there are two components to costs: fixed costs and variable costs. Do we\nknow fixed costs and variable costs by patient, or by patient/ service type?\nInterviewer: Well, actually, we don’t have cost data by patient or by patient/ service type, like\nwe did in the revenues discussion. But we do have cost data per patient on average at the\nhospital.\nInterviewee: So, aggregate data on a per patient level?\nInterviewer: Yes. We know that on average the fixed cost for admitting a patient is $1000. And\nthe cost per patient day is $500. The average length of a patient’s stay is 10 days. And the\nhospital sees 1000 patients each year. The CEO is curious about how many more patients the\nhospital could see if they reduced the length of an average patient day by one day.\n\nInterviewee: Well, currently they are seeing 1000 patients annually. Each patient stays 10 days\non average; so, the hospital has the capacity for 10,000 patient days annually (1000 patientsX 10\ndays= 10,000 patient days). If you reduced the stay to 9 days on average for each patient, then\nthere would be an excess of 1000 patient-days of capacity (10,000 patient-days minus 9000\npatient-days). If each patient stays 9 days on average, then the hospital could see about 111\nmore patients each year (1000 excess patient-days/ 9 days= 111 patients).\nInterviewer: That’s right. Now, how much would costs decrease if they did this?\nInterviewee: Well, currently, they see 1000 patients per year for an average of 10 days each.\nFixed costs for these patients are $1000 X 1000 patients, which equals $1,000,000. Variable\ncosts are 10,000 patient days X $500/ day, which equals $5,000,000. So, their current costs are\n$6,000,000.\nIf they reduced the average patient stay by 1 day, then their variable costs change. They still\nhave the same fixed costs of $1,000,000. But their variable costs have changed: they now have\n9,000 patient days X $500/ day, which equals $4,500,000 in variable costs. That’s a cost savings\nof $500,000 each year.\nInterviewer: That’s right. So, how would you summarize these findings to the CEO and what\nrecommendations would you make?\nInterviewee: On the revenues side, Sugar Magnolia is losing patients in a few segments that\nprovide revenues long-term. For these segments, they need to target and bring in more doctors\nwho “own” these patients and improve their brand in these service areas through promotions,\nthought leader excellence, or community activities that would raise their profile. And they\nshould further segment other patient/ service types (the elderly) in order to realize more\nprofitable patient/ service types within current segments.\nOn the costs side, the hospital could realize significant decreases in variable costs by trimming\ndown patient days, by even a slight amount on a per patient basis. While this is where the\nnumbers and quantitative analysis is more telling, Sugar Magnolia has a social mission to be\nconcerned with, as well as the financial mission that we’ve already discussed at length. Because\nthe hospital needs to provide the best service and healthcare to its patients, it may not be able to\ncut down on patient/ days per patient (the costs side) while maintaining its social goal/ mission.\nAnd for this reason, several quality of care analyses should be done before initiating some of the\ncost-cutting initiatives that have been discussed here.",
  "Columbia_2006_Private Label Sales": "Case 6: Private Label Sales\nBACKGROUND\nFirm: McKinsey & Company\nRound: 2005 Summer, First\nContent: Brainstorming- completely qualitative\nCASE QUESTION\nWe’re going to look at a growing trend in the Consumer Packaged Goods industry. Our client is\na bottled water company (e.g. Poland Springs). A major retailer (e.g. Walmart) wants our client\nto create a private label version of its product. In other words, in addition to our client’s bottled\nwater which they already carry, they want the client to make an additional, lower-priced bottled\nwater which will be their own brand label, (e.g. Walmart Bottled Water).\nWhat are the pros and cons of doing this?\nINTERVIEWER BRIEFING\nAs it was given in the interview, this is more of a situation analysis and brainstorming exercise\nrather than a case to drill down on and crack. As such, there may be many more pros/cons\nbeyond what is listed in the example below. In general, it is important to be structured and try to\nput the pros and cons into clear buckets. Considering the 3C’s (e.g. impact on customer\nrelationship, company’s operational issues, and competitive dynamics) could also be helpful in\nthis case.\nEXAMPLE SOLUTION\nPros:\n• Improved relationship with a powerful merchant (may get better shelf space and better\nterms on other products they purchase from us as well as cross-marketing arrangements)\n• Larger production may achieve better economies of scale in both fixed costs (cost/unit to\nproduce, esp. if certain operational procedures are synergistic) and variable costs\n(delivery, distribution, etc.) in addition to the potential to negotiate better terms with\nsuppliers due to larger orders\n• Huge potential revenue growth for our company (lower price but potentially high\nvolume)\nCons:\n• Cannibalization of our own private label’s water sales (cost/benefit analysis of whether\nthe volume of Wal-Mart’s brand will make up for it)\n• Possibility of lessening our power with the merchant as a supplier if private label takes\noff and supplants our own product\n\n• Higher costs (Fixed- such as additional plant requirements due to potential capacity\nconstraints – will the investment be worth it?)\n• More complicated distribution adding additional SKU into the mix\n• Potentially a different market for our product which does not work synergistically with\nour marketing focus (for example if our product is about prestige and image, we would be\ncatering to a different customer segment with a lower priced product)",
  "Columbia_2006_Piano Market Sizing": "Case 7: Piano Market Sizing\nBACKGROUND\nFirm: McKinsey & Company\nRound: 2005 Summer, Final\nContent: Market sizing\nCASE QUESTION\nWe’re going to look at the sales of Pianos in the United States. What do you think annual sales\n(total revenues) are in the US for Pianos?\nINTERVIEWER BRIEFING\nAnswer should show a logical way of sizing the market. You need to make some assumptions,\nand show your way of getting to an answer. Actual numbers aren’t as important as the logic\nbehind the method.\nEXAMPLE DIALOGUE\nI am thinking there are two types of piano buyers, personal households and institutions. Of those,\na certain percentage already own a piano. Piano buyers, in a given year, would be divided into:\n1) First-time piano owners\n2) Upgrading an old piano or replacing a damaged piano\n3) Adding a second piano (small for households, larger for institutions)\nThen, I would need to estimate who these buyers might be:\nHouseholds: For example, approx. 300 Million people in the US. Avg. household is 3 (which\nmight be high due to many single people.)\nSo, 100 Million households.\nFrom there deduce how many are in the $75,000/year income bracket, as they are most likely to\npurchase a piano (for example, 25% which equals 25 Million households.)\nOut of those 25 Million, 5% currently own a piano already (1.25 Million Pianos).\nIf I assume every year, 2% of the 25 Million will buy a piano, then there are 500K pianos sold to\nhouseholds every year.\nFollow a similar logic for institutions – e.g. colleges, universities, symphonies, Carnegie Hall,\nbars/businesses, etc. Assume that there are 1 million of these institutions, of which 20% (200K)\nwould want a piano. Of that, perhaps 5% buy a piano every year, or 10K pianos sold to\ninstitutions.\nThen, I would need to figure the average price paid per piano.\nIt is important to distinguish between new and used piano sales, as the price points are different.\n\nIn the New Piano market, I would think the low price for a piano is $5,000 and the high price is\n$15,000, so the avg price of a new piano is $10,000.\nFor a used piano, the low is probably $1,000 and new is $5,000, so the average price is $3,000.\nI would venture that 20% of pianos sold are used and 80% are new for both households and\ninstitutions. If this is the case, 102K total new pianos are sold and 408K used pianos are sold.\nTo make the numbers simple, use 100K and 400K. This leads you to $1B in new piano sales and\n$1.2B in used piano sales, or $2.2B in total sales.",
  "Columbia_2006_Gas Stations and Convenience Stores": "Case 8: Gas Stations and Convenience Stores\nBACKGROUND\nFirm: McKinsey & Company\nRound: 2005 Summer, First\nContent: Brainstorming, largely qualitative\nCASE TOPIC\nOur client is major global oil company that owns the whole value chain: oil rigs, refining,\ndistribution, and retail. Our direct contact is the CEO of the global retail operation. His\noperation consists of 1) gas sold at the pumps and 2) the convenience stores at the gas station.\nProfitability of the retail operation has declined, and the CEO would like us to help figure out\nwhy and to come up with a plan for the next five years.\nINTERVIEWER BRIEFING\nThis case is representative of many of the prepared, McKinsey round 1 cases, in which the\ninterviewer actively walks the interviewee through a set of qualitative and quantitative questions.\nThe interviewer should “stick to the script” of questions. To the effect that the interviewee\nstruggles, the interviewer can assist the interviewee to get back on track.\nThe interviewee should be structured in answering qualitative questions and crunch through any\nnumbers thrown his or her way, always keeping in mind how they tie back to the larger issues.\nCASE QUESTIONS\nOver the past fifteen years, the number of gas stations worldwide has declined by six percent.\nQ: What might be the causes of this?\nA: Possible answers include\n• Consolidation\n• Increase in dollar volume per station\n• Changing population patterns (fewer rural stations)\n• More stations open 24 hours (so fewer stations needed)\nSet of questions re: comparative gas station profitability\nIt turns out there have been two other changes in the market. One, the number of gas stations\nwith convenience stores attached has increased. Two, a major new entrant has begun taking\nmarket share. Supermarkets have begun opening gas stations in their parking lots. This is not\nyet a major competitor in the US, where they only have ten percent of the market, but\nsupermarkets have 30% of the gas market in the UK, and 60% in France.\n\nThe next task is to understand whether the supermarkets have a better business model than the\ngas stations in this market, and if so, why. We’ll use the metric of Return on Invested Capital –\noperating profit / invested capital.\nThe numbers for the UK supermarket are as follows: they sell ten million litres of gas per year at\n72 cents/litre. Their cost is 20 cents/litre. They pay 45 cents/liter in tax. The convenience\nstore’s operating profit is 500,000 pounds per year. Overhead in the industry is typically ten\npercent of fuel sales, and that’s accurate here. The capital cost is two million pounds.\nWe’ll compare it to one of our typical gas station locations: downtown, one of our busiest\nlocations. This location sells six million litres per year at 75 cents/litre; its cost and tax per litre\nare the same as the supermarket. Convenience store profit is 20% lower than the supermarket’s.\nOverhead is still ten percent of fuel sales, and capital costs are four million pounds.\nQ: What is the ROIC of the supermarket? A: (24%) (It also may come out here that the\nconvenience store is responsible for all the profits.)\nQ: Without running the numbers, what do you think our client’s gas station’s ROIC will\nbe? Why? A: (Much lower – because of the cost of capital).\nQ: What do you think causes that high cost of capital? A: (downtown location –\nsupermarkets typically in the suburbs.)\nQ: So, given that, what other things that drive ROIC might we be able to affect? A: (Likely\ncan’t change cost or tax – could lower price to sell more gas – could move out of the city – could\nattempt to increase convenience store profitability.)\nClient recommendation:\nThe client agrees with our recommendation to focus on the convenience store, and decides to set\na pilot program in 1,000 stores.\nQ: What type of new products should he introduce? How would you think about what\nproducts to introduce? [Interviewee was required to come up with eight answers – near the end\nhe was helped along with “Think about what we’d ask if he came to us with product A and\nproduct B – what would we ask to be able to decide between those two.”]\nA: Some factors we could use to decide were:\n-What does the existing customer want\n-What products have high margins\n-What can we (and the supplier) support logistically\n-What can we get from existing suppliers\n-What can we link to products that already sell well\n-What products are needed frequently / will drive visits\n-What products are durable\n-What products require little shelf space (space at a premium in these stores).\n\nIn the end the decision was made to introduce hot and cold food – high-margin, low shelf-space,\nhigh-frequency (but low durability). McK is currently implementing in Europe. End of case.",
  "Columbia_2006_Megabank Underpenetration": "Case 9: Megabank Underpenetration\nBACKGROUND\nFirm: McKinsey & Company\nRound: 2005 Summer, First\nContent: Qualitative and quantitative\nCASE TOPIC\nMegabank is a bank that issues credit cards. New cards are sold in three main ways:\n1. cross-sell to existing banking customers\n2. sell to new customers via direct mail campaigns\n3. distribute via private label partnerships with retailers and airline\nMegabank is looking for new card member growth areas in the United States. Its Hispanic\nmarket penetration is low compared to comparable banks’ penetration rates. That group is a fast\ngrowing ethnicity and the bank wants to capitalize on it.\nWhat is the current problem (i.e., what are the possible reasons for the underpenetration in the\nHispanic market?)? How should the bank move forward?\nINTERVIEWER BRIEFING\nRecommended approach:\nThis case is representative of many of the prepared, McKinsey round 1 cases, in which the\ninterviewer actively walks the interviewee through a set of qualitative and quantitative questions.\nThe interviewer should “stick to the script” of questions. To the effect that the interviewee\nstruggles, the interviewer can assist the interviewee to get back on track.\nThe interviewee should be structured in answering qualitative questions and crunch through any\nnumbers thrown his or her way, always keeping in mind how they tie back to the larger issues.\nCASE QUESTIONS\nQ: What might be wrong? Hypothesize.\nA: Discuss briefly the potential of each of the following to affect the penetration rate:\n• Product Definition – Does the card, as it has been defined meet the needs of the\ncustomer?\n• Pricing of Credit Card Terms – Are the fees and rates on par with other comparable\ncards?\n• Marketing/Advertising – Are the messages properly directed to the audience (both\ncontent and distribution)?\n• Channel Partners – Does our target audience shop at / eat at / buy from our partners?\n\n• Internal Sales Messages/Incentive Structure – Are the sales messages correctly structure\nto entice our potential customer? Is our internal sales force (i.e., teller and desk\npersonnel) trained and incented properly to promote the card? Discuss in detail (i.e.,\nwhat might be misaligned, how that might affect adoption rates, etc.).\nQ: Calculate the number of additional members Megabank wants to add based on the\nfollowing information:\n• There are 40 million Hispanic people in the US\n• 3/8ths of them are too young to have credit cards\n• The average customer is worth $180 to the bank over the course of his life\n• Due to decreased acquisition costs, the average Hispanic customer is worth 10% more\n• Currently, the bank’s penetration rate is 10% (of valid customer prospects)\n• They want to get to a 30% level over 5 years\nA: 3/8ths of 40M are too young, so 5/8ths of 40M are valid customer prospects. That translates\nto a market of 25M people.\nThey currently have 10% of 25M = 2.5M\nThey want 30% of 25M = 7.5M\nThey need 5M additional members over 5 years\nQ: How much is that additional market share worth to Megabank (or how much would\nMegabank be willing to spend on that additional market share)?\nA: If the average customer lifetime value is $180, but the average Hispanic customer is worth\n10% more, each customer is worth $198. Rounding that to $200, the total value of 5M extra\nmember is $1B.\nQ: Cross-selling to branch customers is significantly below the industry norms (Average =\n15,000 to 20,000 per month; Megabank = 5,000 per month). What might be the reason?\nA:\n• Product – Is the Megabank product different from competitors’ products? Interviewer:\nNO\n• Pricing – Are the fees and rates different than other comparable cards?\nInterviewer: NO\n• Customer – Are we targeting a fundamentally different audience?\nInterviewer: NO\n• Channel Partners – Are the distribution channels misaligned?\nInterviewer: NO\n• Marketing/Advertising – Is there something wrong with our sales mechanism?\nInterviewer: Let’s investigate\n\nQ: Megabank uses direct mail campaigns to solicit new card members.\n• The average response rate for the non-Hispanic population is 1%.\n• Megabank’s historical response rate from Hispanic prospects is 3%.\n• The bank is planning to target 15M potential customers with each of 3 mailings this\nyear.\n• It expects that after the first mailing, the response rate will drop by 1/3rd in each of\nthe subsequent mailings.\n• The bank has a conversion rate of 45% of respondents.\nHow many new customers should the bank expect after the third mailing?\nA: 3% * 15M = 450,000 from first mailer\n450,000 – 1/3*450,000 = 300,000 from second mailer\n300,000 – 1/3*300,000 = 200,000 from third mailer\n950,000 * 45% conversion = ~450,000 new customers\nQ: You rounded 950,000 to 1,000,000. Would you expect the actual number of new\ncustomers to be more or less than 425,000 and how do you calculate that (in your head)?\nA: Slightly more since 10% of 950,000 is 95,000; therefore 40% is 4*95,000 or 380,000. Add\n5% of 950,000 (or half of 95,000) which is 47,500 to 380,000 to get 427,500. That would be\nsomewhere between 2M and 2.5M over five years.\nQ: You bump into the SVP of Sales (related to the credit card business) in the hall and he asks\n“How does it look?” How do you respond (1 minute only)?\nA: We are still crunching the numbers, but based on your current market position, your goal of\nincreasing penetration by 20%, and historical conversion rates for direct mail campaigns, our\ninitial estimates suggest that you will fall short of your goal by mainly relying on that method of\nacquisition. In fact, it will only get you about half way to your goal. We need to discuss other\nmeasures to increase penetration of the Hispanic market. Specifically, we need to look at your\nsales force compensation structure, training and specific sales and marketing messages. Let’s\nplan to review our formal recommendations later in the week.",

What needs to be considered?\nA:\n• Risk / Malpractice Insurance costs,\n• Value of reduction in pain (to patients),\n• Higher success ratio (without repeat procedure and/or severe complication),\n• Cost savings of keeping fewer Device X’s in inventory, etc.\nThese and other factors might allow us to price Device X above the Cost Neutral Point.\nQ: The company has decided that it wants to sell Device X at a premium above the cost\nneutral point, but a survey of potential customers (Hospital Purchasing Departments)\nshowed that they are only willing to pay $2000/unit. Now what would you recommend?\n\nA: Is the $2000/unit figure a single data point or an average? Average across many customers\nsurveyed\nOne of two things:\n1. Manage Heartcorp’s expectations that they should really expect something close to\n$2000/unit\n2. Increase potential customers’ “willingness to pay”\nQ: How can we increase “willingness to pay”?\nA: Two thoughts:\n• Communicate the benefits (both “soft” (e.g., decreased pain or frequency of re-operation)\nand “hard” (financial)) to the additional stakeholders (i.e., patient advocate groups and\ninsurance payers) in the decision. Work with them to “pressure” the potential buyers of\nDevice X to spend the additional money to realize the added benefits of the new\nhardware.\n• Publish articles about the efficacy of the new device in reputable journals (e.g., JAMA,\nNew England Journal of Medicine, etc.) and use those to convince doctors to pressure\nhospital administration to increase “willingness to pay” for Device X.",

The issuer pays a percentage of transaction fees to Pierce for providing the\nfollowing services:\n• credit authorization,\n• fraud detection,\n• accounting and reporting.\nIssuers outsource this function to companies like Pierce because of the high cost of maintaining\ntheir own IT systems to perform this function. Pierce has hired us to find ways to sustain its\ndouble digit growth that the company has enjoyed for the past 20 years.\nINTERVIEWER BRIEFING\nThis case is representative of many of the prepared, McKinsey round 1 cases, in which the\ninterviewer actively walks the interviewee through a set of qualitative and quantitative questions.\nThe interviewer should “stick to the script” of questions. To the effect that the interviewee\nstruggles, the interviewer can assist the interviewee to get back on track.\nThe interviewee should be structured in answering qualitative questions and crunch through any\nnumbers thrown his or her way, always keeping in mind how they tie back to the larger issues.\nCASE QUESTIONS\nInterviewer: What steps could Pierce take to keep a high growth rate?\nInterviewee: What is Pierce’s current market position in the credit card market?\nInterviewer: Pierce currently serves the 10 of the top 20 issuers of the country. The 20 top\nissuers comprise 90% of the credit card market. The 10 of the top 20 that are not Pierce’s\ncustomers either use Pierce’s competition or perform the function in-house.\nInterviewee: How fast is the credit card market growing?\nInterviewer: The number of credit card transactions is growing at 3% annually.\nInterviewee: How does Pierce price currently in the credit card market?\n\nInterviewer: Pierce earns a percentage of the transaction fee of each transaction.\nInterviewee: Is there any other revenue stream?\nInterviewer: Someone has suggested that Pierce could license its software as another business\nmodel, in addition to being the outsourced processor. In this case, the issuer would license\nPierce software and process the transactions in-house. Pierce would get an upfront license fee\nand ongoing maintenance fee. What should Pierce consider in evaluating the software license\nmodel?\nInterviewee: Possible answers:\n• Danger of cannibalization,\n• Impact of new revenue source- upfront cash and recurring revenue stream\n• Added cost of maintenance and support of this business model.\nInterviewer: Assume that if Pierce offered the software license model, 50% of its existing\ncustomers will switch to this model. 50% of the remaining 10 issues that are not currently\nPierce customer will sign with Pierce. The revenue of providing outsourced processing is\n$1M/year. The upfront fee of license model is $3M and $300K in annual maintenance fee.\nCalculate the impact on revenue for the next 5 years if Pierce offers this new licensing model\n(ignoring time value of money).\nInterviewee: Revenue is $70M under new plan for the next 5 years, compared with $50M if the\nsoftware license model is not adopted.\nInterviewer: Good. What else would you like to know in order to reach a recommendation?\nInterviewee: What is Pierce’s current market position in the debit card market?\nInterviewer: Pierce has 5% market share.\nInterviewee: Who are Pierce’s main competitors in the debit card market? How much market\nshare do they have?\nInterviewer: The market is very fragmented. No player has more than 10% market share. What\ncan Pierce do to gain more market share in the debit card segment?\nInterviewee: Possible answers: acquire competitors, set up a partnership with a competitor, use\ninnovate marketing schemes (e.g. incentives)\nInterviewer: There is another segment of the market, store value segment, where Pierce\ncurrently has no offerings. This is the market of store-specific gift cards, i.e. Starbucks card or\nGAP gift cards. This market is projected to grow at 50% annually over the next 10 years. What\nare some of the issues to consider in determining whether Pierce should enter this market?\n\nInterviewee: Cost of offering this new service vs. potential revenue, difficulty in setting up\npartnerships and Pierce’s experience with this, complexity of a revenue-sharing scheme,\n“stickiness” of store-aligned cards vs. regular cards, potential cannibalization of regular cards\nInterviewer: Suppose we know that the total market of store value is $1B today. The transaction\nfee is 1% of the total value. Processing firms, like Pierce, would earn about 10% of the\ntransaction fees. What is expected revenue from this new segment this year?\n(Note to interviewer: See if the interviewee asks for a market share number. If asked, Pierce\nexpects 30% market share.)\nInterviewee: So Pierce would expect revenue of $300K ($1B * 1% = $10M total transaction\nfees, X 30% market share = $3M Pierce-related transaction fees, X 10% = $300K Pierce take of\nthe transaction fees).\nInterviewer: Suppose it costs $1M to build the system required to process store cards. Assume\n5-year useful life, what’s Pierce’s expected profit (accounting profit) in the first year?\nInterviewee: Answer: $300K – ($1M/5) = $100K",
  "Columbia_2006_European Motorcycles": "Case 12: European Motorcycles\nBACKGROUND\nFirm: Bain\nRound: 2006 FT, Final\nContent: Qualitative and quantitative\nCASE TOPIC\nOur client is a private equity firm that has just purchased a motorcycle manufacturer based in\nGermany that makes sporty bikes. Currently they supply motorcycles to Europe but have no\npresence in the US. They are looking to expand the business into the US but are unsure of how\nto do this. They are considering two models: one is selling through existing dealerships in the\nUS, the other is building a flagship dealership and selling that way.\nOur client wants to consider a few issues. First, is this expansion a good idea? Second, which\nmodel would be the best to pursue?\nAs a starting point, tell me a little about the high level pros and cons of building a flagship\ndealership versus selling through existing channels.\nINTERVIEWER BRIEFING\nRecommended Approach:\nHigh level, you’re going to need to hit the numbers right when they’re presented and be able to\nstep back and synthesize into some sort of meaningful recommendation. Interviewer should\nkeep asking the interviewee to summarize and back-up assumptions.\nInterviewee should keep in mind that this is a PE shop and wants to flip the company quickly –\nthis is a common theme through Bain cases.\nKey Facts:\nFlagship:\nRetail Price: $20K\nCost: $10K\nCost to set up flagship: $3 million\nExisting Channel:\n$250K start up cost\nRetail Price: $20K\nDistributors require 33% gross margin, then there will be a 3% allowance of the sales price that\nwill be reserved for return, selling costs, etc.\n\nEXAMPLE DIALOGUE\nInterviewee: I would think that opening a flagship dealership would have a lot of pros. First, it\nwould probably allow for higher margins as you would own the distribution. Second, you could\ntrain the sales people to sell the right way, position the product correctly, etc. You would also\nthen control your customer data, ability to control marketing messages in the dealership, etc. On\nthe downside, there is the capital investment, the fact that existing dealerships have relationships\nwith customers already in place, distribution channels already in place, and local market\nknowledge. Your brand name is also not well-known in the States, so opening a flagship\ndealership might be difficult.\nInterviewer: OK, that makes sense. What would you think about the profitability?\nInterviewee: I would assume that owning your own dealership would be more profitable in the\nlong run, but short term it might be better to go with the existing channels b/c of the capital\ninvestment. Given that this is a PE firm, they probably don’t want to invest a ton of capital or\nhold for too long.\nInterviewer: That sounds good – let me give you some numbers and let’s see if they match your\nhypothesis:\nFlagship:\nRetail Price: $20K\nCost: $10K\nCost to set up flagship: $3 million\nExisting Channel:\n$250K start up cost\nRetail Price: $20K\nDistributors require 33% gross margin, then there will be a 3% allowance of the sales price that\nwill be reserved for return, selling costs, etc.\nInterviewer: What’s the breakeven in both cases?\nInterviewee: The breakeven in terms of a flagship store is 300 bikes ($3,000K / [$20K-10K]).\nFor the distributor model, you assume a 33% gross margin, so 33% of 20K is 6.6K. That means\nwe still get 13.3K. With a 3% allowance, that means we roughly take in 13K for every bike.\nThat’s 3K profit. $250 / $3 is about 83 bikes.\nInterviewer: Right. What does that tell you?\nInterviewee: That our breakeven is lower in the existing distributor model. It also tells me that\nin terms of investing in the long term the flagship would be MUCH more profitable.\n\nInterviewer: So how conceivable are these numbers?\nInterviewee: I would think selling 83 bikes should be fairly easy in a year. 300... it also sounds\nreasonable.\nInterviewer:\n100\n90\n80\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\nPrice Type Origin\n(Presents chart – chart shows all sorts of things but relevant info is that 100K bikes are sold in\nthe US every year, and it’s broken down 3 ways. First by country of origin, next by price, third\nby type. Turns out 15% of bikes are from Europe, 30% are high end (20K or higher), and\nroughly 10% are sporty.)\nNow what do you think?\nInterviewee: (takes time to think) Alright, so now I know 100K bikes are sold. So 15K of\nthem come from Europe, 30% of those or 4.5K are high end, and 10% of those are sporty.\nThat’s 450 bikes. So maybe 300 would be a stretch, and 83 might even be tough if there are\nstrong competitors.\nInterviewer: I would argue that the country of origin doesn’t matter. A sporty 20K bike is a\nsporty 20K bike, right?\nInterviewee: I’d actually disagree. Think about automobiles – some people buy German cars\nb/c they want to buy German cars, nothing else. Or think about beers. Some people only like\ndloS\nsekiB\nfO\n%\n100K 100K 100K\nunits units units\ntotal total total\nSporty Europe\n$20K\nand\nover\nNon-\nSporty\nOther\nUnder\n$20K\n\nBelgian beers for no reason except that their Belgian – it’s an image thing, right? (Note: This\nwas not well received by the interviewer.)\nInterviewer: OK, there’s no right or wrong answer. Assume that I’m right and the market is\nmuch bigger. Now what?\nInterviewee: OK, then it seems feasible. So short term the better play is to use distribution\ncenters that are already in place, but long term it would be to build a flagship.\nInterviewer: And does the fact that it’s a PE client have any bearing here?\nInterviewee: Well, they’ll want to turn it over quickly and not pour cash into it, so they’d likely\ngo with existing channels and not build. They also might want to examine why they’re thinking\nabout the US – maybe they can grow in other parts of Europe more efficiently and profitably.\nInterviewer: Great.",
  "Columbia_2006_Street Sweepers": "Case 13: Street Sweepers\nBACKGROUND\nFirm: BCG\nRound: 2006 FT, Final\nContent: Mainly qualitative\nCASE QUESTION\nOur client is a large industrial conglomerate that has $60-70 million in annual revenues and is\nextremely profitable. They have engaged BCG to examine one of their business units that is\nunderperforming. The unit manufactures and distributes street sweepers (zamboni/lawnmower-\nlike machines that a person would ride and which uses two large rotating brushes to sweep up the\nstreet as it moves by) and has been doing so for 20 years. While never a standout division, until\nrecently it had always been profitable. 4-5 years ago the profit margins started to fall and it is\ncurrently just above breakeven.\nManagement of the conglomerate had made a decision 2 years ago that they did not want to\ninvest in new features for their product lines and has the approach that they don’t want to invest\nsignificant amounts of capital now (unless they can be convinced otherwise).\nBCG’s task is to analyze the unit’s performance and recommend to the management of the\nconglomerate what should be done. Tell me some of the areas you’d consider looking into here\nknowing that we only have a few weeks to finish this engagement.\nINTERVIEWER BRIEFING\nThe interviewer did not allow time for development of a framework – that isn’t the point of the\ncase. Instead, the interviewer simply starts asking questions and they should be answered as\nthoughtfully as possible on short notice. Being thoughtful but remaining structured is vital here:\nsticking to profits = revenue – costs and drilling down on costs and revenues. This is a great case\nb/c if you understand basic drivers- it’s completely rational.\nEXAMPLE DIALOGUE\nInterviewee: That’s a tight timeline, so let’s focus on big areas. So profit is revenues minus\ncosts. Can you tell me about recent trends with regard to costs?\nInterviewer: Sure. A quick look at the numbers showed costs have been fairly constant over the\npast 20 years, only increasing with inflation.\nInterviewee: So I’m thinking I’ll then move into revenue. How has that stood up?\nInterviewer: Revenue has fallen steadily over the past 5 years. Why might this be happening?\n\nInterviewee: It might be happening because of trends in the market, changes in customer\npreferences...\nInterviewer: Since you mention it, who are the customers?\nInterviewee: I suppose they would be municipalities, governments, etc. I don’t see this as\nbeing something for individual use.\nInterviewer: Usually not. That’s right, it’s mostly state and local governments. So we looked\ninto the customers and they are keeping with past trends, replacing their street sweepers every 4-\n7 years, and the number of municipalities purchasing street sweepers has remained constant.\nWhat else might be driving revenues down?\nInterviewee: Prices could be coming down...\nInterviewer: Prices have actually remained constant.\nInterviewee: So how about competition? Have new competitors entered the market or stolen\nmarket share?\nInterviewer: There have been no new competitors. These are what sales have looked like 20\nyears ago to now. What do you want to know after looking at this?\n100%\n90%\n80%\n70%\n60% C\n50% B\n40%\nClient (A)\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%\n10 yrs ago 5 yrs ago Today\nInterviewee: It looks like B has taken share from us. I’d like to know what B is doing\ndifferently. And for that matter what C is doing differently so as to be unaffected.\n\nInterviewer: About 5 years ago, B introduced a new technology that used air vacuums to clean\nstreets instead of the mechanical collecting methods that had always been used in the past.\nThese air machines are more effective at picking up small debris like sand and small litter, and\nwork more quickly and efficiently than the mechanical ones previously offered. Price points are\nabout the same. B still sells mechanical machines, but the drop in our market share was directly\nrelated to the new air offering.\nInterviewee: So how about C?\nInterviewer: C makes machines that are far more heavy-duty, it’s really a different type of\noffering.\nInterviewee: So we don’t compete with C in reality?\nInterviewer: No, but we could. Do you think we’d want to?\nInterviewee: Not likely without knowing much about the market. They seem to have been\nstable and have an expertise, so unless we can offer something new to their customers I’d guess\nthey’ll defend their position in a niche market at all costs.\nInterviewer: Good, that’s the conclusion we quickly came to on C. Now, what other\ninformation do you need to recommend something for our client?\nInterviewee: I need to know if we can replicate the air technology.\nInterviewer: We can, but it will take 2 years and cost $25 million.\nInterviewee: Since you said management does not want to make a significant investment, that\nseems unlikely. So other than that, what trends do we expect from this market going forward?\nInterviewer: What would you think?\nInterviewee: (Pause) I guess the encouraging news is that we’re still selling despite the new\ntechnology and the similar price point. So do municipalities need both?\nInterviewer: Good observation. In fact they do need both. So we broke the country into 7\nregions, all of which needed the same amount of street sweepers overall. In the north, on\naverage there was a 22/8 ratio of mechanical to air sweepers needed. In the south, it was 22/18\n(these numbers do not include C’s models). For the country, what % of street sweeper sales\nwere going to be that are mechanical?\nInterviewee: Roughly 66% (It’s actually 64%).\nInterviewer: Yes. So why would municipalities need mechanical sweepers if air ones are more\nefficient, and what does this tell you?\n\nInterviewee: I’d think they’d need mechanical ones to deal with larger, more solid things on\ntheir streets. It looks like in the south they can use more air machines which would make sense\nb/c they’d have sand and small debris. In the north you might get larger rocks, chunks of ice,\netc. This tells me the market isn’t going to zero, so maybe the company can simply protect the\nmarket share that it has, scale back production to the point where the market will be in\nequilibrium between air and mechanical sweepers, and keep decent margins going forward.\nInterviewer: Right, so that’s exactly what we recommended. Once we recognized these trends,\nwe also looked for a strategic buyer, and in fact the conglomerate sold the unit to a foreign\ncompany that already had air technology developed. That was outside the scope of this case,\nthough – just an interesting follow-up.",
  "Columbia_2006_Eye Surgery": "Case 14: Eye Surgery\nOVERVIEW\nFirm: BCG\nRound: 2006 FT, First\nContent: Market sizing, qualitative and quantitative\nCASE QUESTION\nOur client is a manufacturer of equipment for eye surgery. Specifically, the machines measure\ndeficiency in eyes, and the company also produces lasers for post-operational procedures and\nadjustments. They don’t actually make the lasers or devices used for Lasik – rather, they are\ncomplementary products for this procedure.\nThe global market for these devices is growing, but at a declining rate. As a result, the client\nwants to get into a higher growth area, so they are looking at acquiring a company that makes\ninter-ocular devices. These devices are used instead of Lasik but with similar effectiveness, and\nthey are used for two major categories of patients:\n1 – patients with cataracts\n2 – refractive surgery (to correct near or far sightedness)\nHow would you approach this opportunity? What would you look at?\nAdditional information provided during questioning\nInterviewee asked about the specifics of what the machines were so as to consider synergies\nbetween the two companies and product offerings. There would be significant synergies and that\nis a component of answering the case.\nINTERVIEWER BRIEFING\nRecommended Approach\nGiven that we’re looking at a company with an existing product line that is exploring moving\ninto a related product line, we need to understand any links between the two. It is vital that the\ninterviewee demonstrates his acknowledgement of the risks of cannibalization and the benefits of\nsynergy between the old and new lines. Also key is to show an understanding of some of the\nbasics of M&A. High level, a framework looking into internal factors of both the target and\nacquirer (such as culture, finances, and the synergies there might be between the two), external\nfactors such as market trends and competition, and customer factors (both doctors and patient\nsegments) is necessary. The interviewee should also remember the significance of the valuation\nof the target- is it worth the asking price.\nThis case is fairly simple if you hit the numbers – take your time and get them right. The overall\nframework was very helpful as interviewee was able to reference it multiple times during a fairly\n\nfocused case discussion. The key is identifying that there will be different types of customers for\neach offering, so suggesting IDing customer segments up front seemed to be a major plus.\nKey Facts\n• US population is roughly 300M\no 75% of the US population over 65 has cataracts\no US population is evenly distributed over 80 years, the same number of people are\neach age\no When someone turns 65, they have a 75% chance of getting cataracts, and if they\ndon’t get it immediately they will never get it\no 1/3 of the population is near-sighted and 1⁄4 of the population is far-sighted->\n175M people need vision correction of some kind\n• There are government caps on pricing for cataracts surgery and that there is substantial\ncompetition from major national players.\n• The refractive market is still very fragmented and growing rapidly – 1.5M surgeries/year\nwill grow to 3-4M as procedures become safer. Also, the patient pays 10x as much for\nrefractive surgery as a cataracts patient would pay.\nEXAMPLE DIALOGUE\nInterviewee: I would look into internal factors of both the target and acquirer (such as culture,\nfinances, and the synergies there might be between the two), external factors such as market\ntrends and competition, and customer factors (both doctors and patient segments). Related to all\nof these would be the valuation placed on the company. If we could, I’d like to start with drilling\ndown on the customers.\nInterviewer: OK, I like that. So let’s talk about the cataracts patients. If I were to tell you that\n75% of the US population over 65 has cataracts, how many potential patients are we talking\nabout?\nInterviewee: Well I know that 12% of the population is 65+, so let’s call that 10% for\nsimplicity. 10% of 300 million is 30 million. 75% of that is 22.5 million. But some of those\npeople might already have had surgery.\nInterviewer: Good point. And it gets a little dicey because the segment would be skewed\ntowards 65. So here is a simplifying assumption – assume the US population is evenly\ndistributed over 80 years, the same number of people are each age. When someone turns 65,\nthey have a 75% chance of getting cataracts, and if they don’t get it immediately they will never\nget it. What’s the market size thinking this way?\nInterviewee: OK, so we have 300 million people over 80 years. That’s 3.75 million people in\neach year age bucket. So it would be 3.75 million people turning 65 every year. If 75% of them\nget cataracts, that’s... roughly 2.9 people a year. Plus some percentage of the population already\nover 65, I’m thinking right around 3 million people a year.\n\nInterviewer: Does that make sense?\nInterviewee: I don’t know a lot about cataracts, but it seems to. I’m not sure all of those people\ncurrently get laser eye surgery currently, though.\nInterviewer: Right. OK, now let’s turn our attention to the refractive surgery market. So your\nresearch tells you that 1/3 of the population is near-sighted and 1⁄4 of the population is far-\nsighted. Assume that those numbers already include those who’ve had their vision corrected.\nHow many people are we talking about for the potential market size?\nInterviewer: (Works out 4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12; 7/12 * 300 million people total = 175 [shortcut:\n1/4 of 100 = 25, * 7 = 175]) 175 million people.\nInterviewer: Right. And it turns out that it translates to 1.5 million people a year actually\ngetting refractive surgery. So if we acquire this company and can position it as a cataracts\nprovider or a refractive surgery provider, which should we position it as? (note: the machinery\nwould be slightly different, enough so that it would be beneficial to go after one market or the\nother).\nInterviewee: OK, so I know that the cataracts market is around 3 million a year and the\nrefractive market is 1.5 million a year. But I don’t know anything about profitability so I can’t\nreally say. Can you tell me a bit about the markets?\nInterviewer: What do you want to know?\n(Key information: There are government caps on pricing for cataracts surgery and that there is\nsubstantial competition from major national players. On the other hand, the refractive market is\nstill very fragmented and growing rapidly – 1.5 will grow to 3-4 as procedures become safer.\nAlso, the patient pays 10x as much for refractive surgery as a cataracts patient would pay).\nInterviewee: So based on what we just discussed I’d like to target the refractive market.\nInterviewer: Is there anything else you would want to know before making a decision to buy the\ncompany?\nInterviewee: I’d need to know more about the financials to give a clear answer. I’d also need to\nbetter understand the synergies and how they’d be perceived in the market. However, it looks\npromising given our examination of the market segments.\nInterviewer: Excellent.",
  "Columbia_2006_Meditest": "Case 15: Meditest\nOVERVIEW\nFirm: McKinsey and Company\nRound: 2006 FT, First\nContent: Market sizing, qualitative and quantitative\nCASE QUESTION\nOur client is called Meditest – they make equipment for blood sample test labs. Specifically,\ntheir machines are used to test blood samples for their glucose levels, meaning they are used to\nmonitor diabetes. Their machines are very expensive, often costing more that $20K, and they\nmust be operated by professionals. They also make the consumables that go in these machines.\nMeditest has a presence only in Europe.\nThe market for these large machines is growing very slowly and Meditest is looking for more\ngrowth. They have designed patient-operated machines that can do simple glucose level tests.\nThese devices are small and portable, are easy to operate, and do not need much in the way of\nextra consumables.\nMeditest is considering launching this device, called glucore, in the UK. They have retained\nMcKinsey to examine what considerations they should have in this launch.\nINTERVIEWER BRIEFING\nRecommended Approach\nThe first step is to establish a framework. Ideally, the interviewee would take into account\ninternal and external factors, the characteristics of the customers, and why UK?\n- Internal considerations: capabilities, capital, culture\n- External considerations: competition, regulation, market trends\n- Customers: market size, segmentation, preferences, payment assistance\n- Why UK?: why not other places, why not other value-added services for their core\nproduct?\nOnce you get through the framework in a McKinsey case, it’s more or less listen and respond so\ntry to think about the implications of what you’re being told and analyzing.\nThis case represents a mix of numbers and detail analysis, then the need to step back and\nconsider what the numbers are telling you. Take a moment to think about the numbers in context\nand it should be fine.\nKey Facts\n• Size of the market is 108K people/year\no Population of the UK is 60 million.\n\no 20% of that population is over 65 years old.\no Of those over 65 years old, 5% are currently diabetes sufferers.\no Of those under 65, 1% of the population are currently diabetes sufferers.\no 10% of the population buys glucore every year\n• Revenues will be 2.16M pounds/year in 4 years\no Price point on these machines today is 120 pounds.\no The marketing department project that the price will fall by 50% in 4 years (60\npounds)\no Total market will grow by 33% in terms of people with diabetes (144K)\no In four years we will have acquired a 25% market share (36K)\nEXAMPLE DIALOGUE\nInterviewee: I would look at internal and external factors, the characteristics of the customers,\nand why the UK vs. elsewhere\n- Internal considerations: capabilities, capital, culture\n- External considerations: competition, regulation, market trends\n- Customers: market size, segmentation, preferences, payment assistance\n- Why UK?: why not other places, why not other value-added services for their core\nproduct?\nIs there anywhere in specific you’d like me to start?\nInterviewer: Let’s start with the customers. You said you wanted to think about the market size\nfor this product. How would you do that? What would you need to know?\nInterviewee: Well, I’d need to know the percentage of the population with diabetes, the total\npopulation, then the percent that could afford this item. I’d need a price as well if you wanted\nthe market size in pounds.\nInterviewer: Let’s just do it in terms of people and add in the pounds later. So the population of\nthe UK is 60 million. 20% of that population is over 65 years old. Of those over 65 years old,\n5% are currently diabetes sufferers. Of those under 65, 1% of the population are currently\ndiabetes sufferers.\nInterviewee: Through my calculation I get 1.08M people (1/5 of 60M = 12M; 5% * 12M =\n120K*5 = 600K. 1% * 48M = 480K. 600K + 480K = 1.08M)\nInterviewer: Right, now what else do you need to know?\nInterviewee: I need to know how many people will buy this device.\nInterviewer: So assume that 10% of the population buys every year. How many people is that?\n\nInterviewee: 108,000\nInterviewer: Does that sound like a lot to you?\nInterviewee: Not really. We’re talking about a company that sells machines for over 20K\napiece, so without knowing anything about the price of this new product it seems like this is a\npretty small total market to be going after.\nInterviewer: Alright, we’ll come back to that. Assume the price point on these machines today is\n120 pounds. The marketing department project that the price will fall by 50% in 4 years. Also\nin 4 years they assume the total market will grow by 33% in terms of people with diabetes. In\naddition, in four years we will have acquired a 25% market share. What will our revenues be in\n4 years?\nInterviewee: The price will fall to 60 pounds (0.5*60 pounds), and the number of purchases in a\ngiven year will grow to 144,000 (108,000/3 = 36,000). Our market share is 25%, so there will be\n36,000 people buying (144,000 / 4 = 36,000) at 60 pounds per person. That brings me to a\nrevenue number of 2.16 million pounds.\nInterviewer: Good. Now how does that number sound to you?\nInterviewee: It still sounds a little low for the type of growth I believe this company is looking\nfor.\nInterviewer: So what are some levers you might pull to increase that number?\nInterviewee: There are a number of drivers. First there is the population size – you might want\nto include other countries or markets to increase the overall field you’re competing in. From\nmarket share, you could try to position yourself differently, maybe as the more convenient option\nor the most trusted one. Or you could try to keep prices high. I’d think the most logical would\nbe to try to hit more people overall.\nInterviewer: You mentioned price. How would you think about pricing this product?\nInterviewee: I would think about the value add to consumers in terms of the convenience\noffered and money saved. If this means they don’t have to go to the physician then they will be\nsaving time and money.\nInterviewer: Do consumers always pay for their trips to the doctor?\nInterviewee: No. Often insurance would pay, so they might be willing to do some sort of a co-\npay for devices like this. The devices might also prompt people to keep better tabs on their\nblood-sugar levels which insurance companies would like a lot. After all, the major cost to\ninsurance companies is the catastrophe, so anything cutting down those chances would probably\nbe a good investment.\n\nInterviewer: Right. So if you had to summarize what we’ve looked at so far...\nInterviewee: We’ve looked the current size of the market in the UK for consumer blood-sugar\nmonitoring devices, as well as the growth potential in four years. There seem to be lots of\nbenefits to the customers and to insurance companies meaning the product should be accepted if\neffective. However, it seems that a launch just in the UK has limited revenue potential.",
  "Columbia_2006_Magazine Growth": "Case 20: Magazine Growth\nOVERVIEW\nFirm: Marakon Associates\nRound: 2006 FT, First\nContent: Qualitative\nCASE QUESTION\nOur client is a large media conglomerate, 4-Star Media. 4-Star functions mostly in online and\nprint media, and within those in 3 major segments:\n4) Enthusiast Media – something like Hot Rod Magazine, Snowboarder Weekly, or S&M\nfor the elderly.\n5) Consumer Guides – Motor Trend, Consumer Reports, etc.\n6) Business News\nWe’re going to be focusing mostly on the business news segment today. It’s called Prime Inc.\nand is broken down into print and online media itself. There is a website but it basically just\nreproduces the news that’s in the magazine. The business news segment has seen declining\nrevenues over the past 5 years after decades of very stable growth. We’ve been hired to consider\ntwo things. First, we need to determine why revenues have been declining and second, we need\nto recommend some alternatives to stimulate growth.\nAdditional information provided during questioning\nAs the interviewer, you should recognize that most of the revenues from the magazine business\ncome from advertising as opposed to subscriptions. You also will know the results of some prior\nconsumer research showing that there is low brand awareness from target customers who don’t\nalready subscribe and former / current readers don’t feel the content is as insightful.\nSOLUTION\nHigh level, the student suggested a framework looking into internal factors such as a change in\nthe price structures or a change in the product, external factors like competition or market\ndynamics, and customer factors like segmentation or preferences. The student also brainstormed\nsome ideas for growth, then followed the lead of the interviewer.\nBreakdown of solution (including quantitative analyses and qualitative evaluations)\nInterviewer: What would you look at in terms of addressing the first issue (revenue declines)?\nInterviewee: (Presents framework)\n\nInterviewer: That makes sense. So I can tell you right away that there was no change in pricing\nstructure or the product itself, so that takes care of internal factors. Let’s talk about the\ncustomers. What would you want to know about them?\nInterviewee: I’d like to know who they are, what the target is, what they think of the product...\nInterviewer: Which customers are you talking about?\nInterviewee: I’m talking about the people who actually buy the magazine... but those aren’t\nthe only customers. There are also ad sales in any media business like this one.\nInterviewer: Right. And off the top of your head, which would you say contributes more to total\nrevenue, subscription revenue or ad revenue?\nInterviewee: To be honest I’d have to say advertising revenue only because I know television\nrelies on it so heavily.\nInterviewer: In fact it is advertising revenue, and it’s about a 3/1 ratio. So does that mean we\nshould focus more heavily on advertisers than the subscribers?\nInterviewee: I’d actually think the opposite. I’d think that we’d want to focus on building a\nloyal, desirable subscription base that advertisers want. My general feeling is that if we have the\ndemographics that the advertisers want to hit, they will not only come to us, but it fact may be\nwilling to pay a premium in some cases. I wouldn’t see focus on advertisers as being all that\nuseful if we can’t deliver on promises we make them.\nInterviewer: OK, so back to the customers. We look at the numbers and find that subscription is\nwaning. How would you examine why this is happening?\nInterviewee: I’d try to look at syndicated reports first to get a sense of where people were\nturning for business news, but I think I’d want to go out and speak to the target customers, both\nsubscribers and non-subscribers.\nInterviewer: So you are able to conduct a market research study and you find that those who\nnever subscribed have very low brand awareness, and those who have lapsed and even some\nwho still subscribe feel that the magazine is not as insightful as it once was. You also find that\nthe average reader is now 10 years older than they were 5 years ago. What are your thoughts?\nInterviewee: Touching on the different things you told me, I’m less concerned about the low\nbrand awareness because if we have a differentiated, quality product we can advertise it and\nposition it better in the future. I’m more concerned that people feel the magazine is not as\ninsightful. You said the product hasn’t really changed, so does this have to do with competition?\nInterviewer: What do you think?\n\nInterviewee: I’d think so, maybe even to do with the availability of news on the internet. So\nmaybe simply reporting the news doesn’t get it done anymore. And that could also explain some\nof the change in reader demographics – younger people realize they can just go to the internet for\nbasic news, and they get that instantly.\nInterviewer: So that was a key issue. What might Prime Inc. do about it?\nInterviewee: Maybe change the content a bit, do more human interest stories that skew\nyounger. I guess it depends on what advertisers they want and how far they can go without\nangering their existing readers. Maybe do stories about how execs were using technology to\nsolve problems in their organizations.\nInterviewer: So who is the demographic here?\nInterviewee: For a business newspaper, I’d say 35-65, mostly male but not entirely, and high\nincome bracket.\nInterviewer: Right, and who would want to market to those people\nInterviewee: Business services, leisure, apparel, etc.\nInterviewer: So let me give you 2 pieces of information. Of the top 5 magazines doing business\nnews, Prime Inc has the lowerst share of that demographic and the highest price per ad per 1000\nreaders. What does that tell you?\nInterviewee: They’re overcharging – if they’re not hitting the target demographic (even if\nthey’re hitting other ones) why would an advertiser pay the most money to advertise with them?\nInterviewer: So what do you recommend?\nInterviewee: Lowering ad prices to be competitive.\nInterviewer: Do we want to lower them across the board? What should we be aware of?\nInterviewee: Well not all advertisers are the same. Some do more volume and perhaps different\nindustries have different price elasticities. We should give our volume advertisers bigger\ndiscounts so we don’t lose them unless they are not sensitive to price – we can probably look\nhistorically as well as currently to see trends.\nInterviewer: Great. And how about alternative strategies to grow the business to those who\nhaven’t heard of it?\nInterviewee: I’d think you can use the website, try to leverage other media within the\norganization, develop proprietary content, launch a large ad campaign, etc...\n\nConclusions, summary, and additional thoughts\nThis case is straightforward if you can talk about the relationship between the end reader and the\nadvertiser. If practicing with this case, try to get the interviewee to think outside the box as there\nwas a lot of ‘idea generation’ through the course of the case. An understanding of the publishing\nindustry is helpful but not necessary, just ask a lot of questions if it’s new territory.",
  "Columbia_2006_CPG Company": "Case 17: CPG Company\nOVERVIEW\nFirm: BCG\nRound: 2006 FT, Final\nContent: Qualitative and quantitative\nCASE QUESTION\nA large food and beverage consumer packaged goods company (CPG) is the client. They have a\n40% market share in traditional CPG channels, like large format grocery. They have a 17%\nmarket share in food service. They hired us to help them grow that food service business. How\nwould you structure that?\nINTERVIEWER BRIEFING\nRecommended Approach\nThis is really a 3 Cs case. If you use the 3 C’s, develop questions around them that are relevant\nto the specific question, and probe the interviewer for new, relevant information, then you can\ncrack it. This is not a numbers case. Some knowledge of marketing and consumer packaged\ngoods would be helpful. Later in the case, using the 4 Ps to help think through the questions\nabout how specifically to grow market share would be helpful in generating ideas.\nKey Facts\nThere’s a lot of additional information in this case. The interviewee should probe for this\ninformation because it’s essential for solving the case.\n- The client has one major competitor in beverage, but no major competitor in their foods\nportfolio. The beverage portfolio consists of sodas, waters, juices, teas, health drinks,\nand new specialty bottled drinks—no alcoholic beverages. The food portfolio consists\nprimarily of snack foods—for throughout the day (ie, breakfast, lunch, and later). The\nclient’s main competitor is a major beverage company—but they don’t have any sort of\nfood portfolio.\n- The client’s share is 17% across the food service market. But within this market, the\nmarket share for the client varies in the different segments and subsegments. There are\nthree primary segments in the food service market: 1) cafeteria/ workplace food service,\n2) restaurants (which is comprised of fast food, slow fast food/ alternative fast food, and\nother), 3) entertainment/ theme park venues, and 4) misc. Amongst these segments,\nrestaurants is definitely the largest—70% of the market.\n- Within restaurants, there are a few subsegments: 1) fast food (Wendy’s, BK,\nMcDonald’s), 2) slow fast food/ alternative fast food (Chipotle, Au Bon Pain, Cosi,\nCalifornia Pizza Kitchen Express, Wolfgang Puck’s), and 3) Misc. (corner deli, mom and\n\npop, etc.). The fast food segment is dominated by our major competitor, who has a 70%\nmarket share in the segment. Slow fast food/ alternative fast food is a smaller segment,\nbut it is growing at 30% a year, as a part of a trend of eating healthier.\nEXAMPLE DIALOGUE\nInterviewee: I’d like to make sure that I understand the case. So, our client is a traditional\nCPG, with a beverage and foods portfolio. Can you tell me a bit more about that portfolio? I’m\nassuming that they have sodas and juices? Do they have other types of drinks?\nInterviewer: Sure. The beverage portfolio consists of sodas, waters, juices, teas, health drinks,\nand new specialty bottled drinks—no alcoholic beverages.\nInterviewee: What about their food portfolio? What is that comprised of?\nInterviewer: The food portfolio consists primarily of snack foods—for throughout the day (ie,\nbreakfast, lunch, and later). That’s one thing that makes us distinctive from our main\ncompetitor—we have both a food and beverage portfolio. Our main competitor only has\nbeverages.\nInterviewee: Interesting. So, they have a pretty comprehensive portfolio. Can I have a minute\nto structure my thoughts?\nInterviewer: Sure. Take your time.\n(Now the interviewee should take a few minutes to structure the case. This will require more\nthan just laying out a framework but also identifying key questions that will help them drive to an\nanswer.)\nInterviewee: I would like to know about three main things: 1) customers, 2) our company and\ncapabilities, and 3) the competition and how we can differentiate between them. In those three\nmain categories of information, there are a few key questions that I’d like to answer. This is how\nI might structure it:\n\n• Who are the potential customers in the food service\nmarket?\nCafeteria/ Workplace food service\nCustomers\nRestaurants—fast food, slow fast food, other?\nEntertainment venues—movie theaters, theme parks\nOther?\n• What’s in our portfolio?\nFood portfolio\nCompany Beverage portfolio\n• Do we have any capabilities that are specific to us?\n• Who are our competitors?\n• What do we have that differentiates us from our\nCompetitors competition?\n• Where are our competitors strong? Where are we\nstronger than them? (Mkt. shares?)\nInterviewer: That’s good. What would you like to start with first?\nInterviewee: Well, we already talked about our company and portfolio a bit; is there anything\nelse that I should know about our company. Like, do we have any capabilities that our\ncompetition doesn’t have?\nInterviewer: Not really.\nInterviewee: Well, I’d like to know a little more about customers in the market. I don’t know\nmuch about the food service market, but I imagine that there’s a lot that falls into the group of\ncustomers.\nInterviewer: You’re right. You’ve listed a few. Why don’t we discuss those.\nInterviewee: Sure. I imagine that food service includes things like cafeterias, both at schools\nand universities. And, I know that the company that I worked at before school had a cafeteria—\nmaybe that as well?\nInterviewer: Yep. What else do you have?\nInterviewee: Well, then, there’s movie theaters and theme parks—maybe places like bowling\nalleys?\nInterviewer: Sure. What else?\n\nInterviewee: Yes, there’s also restaurants. And then, there might be customers that I’m\nforgetting. Is there anything else?\nInterviewer: Sure, there’s probably some sort of miscellaneous group—but you’ve covered the\nmain ones. So, of those main three, what do you think the sizes of the segments are?\n(The Interviewer is testing the interviewee’s business judgment/ common sense in asking for the\ninterviewee’s sense of the sizes of the segments.)\nInterviewee: I think that miscellaneous is pretty small. And then, the entertainment one is also\npretty small and stable. But the cafeteria/ workplace one, I imagine that that’s a little bigger—\nand maybe it’s growing. And then, the restaurant one, I bet that’s the largest. Though, I’m not\nsure how fast it’s growing.\nInterviewer: You’re basically right. The restaurant segment is definitely the largest—it’s about\n70% of the food service market.\nInterviewee: If I think back to the original question of helping them grow their share in the food\nservice segment, I think that I would focus on the restaurant segment. Can you tell me a bit more\nabout that segment of the food service market?\nInterviewer: Well, what do you think about that segment?\n(Part of what the Interviewer is testing here is the interviewee’s ability to use common sense to\nlead the case and see what they can deduce on their own.)\nInterviewee: Well, I imagine that restaurants includes a few subsegments. For a CPG, high-end\nrestaurants are out. But in the low-end, there’s probably fast food, delis and mom and pop shops,\nand miscellaneous.\nInterviewer: That’s right. There’s one big, new one that you’re missing. It’s referred to as\n“slow fast food.” It’s new chains with more made-to-order, healthier food. It’s restaurants like\nChipotle, Boston Market, Cosi, etc. It’s part of people’s need to eat healthier.\nInterviewee: Interesting. I imagine that this new segment is growing a lot faster than the other\nsegments. But it’s small. If I think about the original question of the case, if I was going to try to\ngrow market share, I might try to grow it throughout the restaurant segments. However, before I\nmake a recommendation, I’d like to know a bit more about the competition—we haven’t talked\nmuch about that.\nInterviewer: You’re right. Well, the competition is pretty fierce in the fast food subsegment. E\nhave one main competitor. They only make beverages, and they have a 70% market share in fast\nfood.\n\nInterviewee: Wow. Well, given that, I would focus on the other two segments: this new slow,\nfast food segment and the mom and pop segment.\nInterviewer: Great. What would you do to try to focus on them and grow your market share\nwith them?\n(The interviewee might want to take a few seconds to think about the answer to this question.\nIt’s kind of the crux of the answer to the case. Since it’s a marketing question—how to grow\nmarket share—the 4 Ps come in as a handy framework to use to think through the case.)\n• Are there customers in the restaurant segment that we’re\nnot taking care of right now? New sub-segments?\nPlacement\n• Can we offer specialty products/ tailor-made products to\nrestaurants?\nProduct\n• Can we offer new product packaging that is specific to our\nrestaurant customers?\n• Should we compete on price? Do we want to compete\non price? (Price competition could grow our unit share,\nPrice\nbut hurt of $ volume market share—and our profits\noverall)\n• Can we cross-promote with our restaurant customers?\nPromotion •Will cross-promotion help grow restaurant customers’\nloyalty to us?\nInterviewee: Well, there are a few things that we could to grow our share with these customers.\nIn terms of price, well, we could change our price, but I don’t think that we want to compete on\nprice. That could help us grow our unit volume share, but it might hurt our dollar volume share\nand definitely would hurt our profits. In terms of placement/ distribution, is there a way that we\ncan grow our share by distributing to new customers/ locations?\nInterviewer: Maybe. But we already distribute to a majority of the market. What else could you\ndo to grow share.\nInterviewee: In terms of promotion, maybe they can create partnerships with certain customers\nor customer chains and run cross promotion campaigns—like advertising campaigns, or coupons.\nAnd in terms of product, maybe they can create customized products for their restaurant\ncustomers? Like new packaging? Specialty sizes, etc?\n\nInterviewer: Yep. That’s great. That’s a good way to grow share. But can you just quickly give\nme some of the pros and cons of specialty or custom products?\n(Here, the Interviewer is testing the interviewee’s ability to identify some business risks with new\nideas—testing business judgment and risk identification.)\nInterviewee: Well, on the pros side, it would build a special relationship with the customer; it\nmight differentiate us from our competition. On the cons side, our profit margins would\ndefinitely decrease on custom products. So, we might grow our share, but not our overall bottom\nline.\nInterviewer: That’s right. So, is there anything else—other than custom products or any of the\nideas that you mentioned—that can help us grow our share in the restaurant segment?\n(Here, the Interviewer is looking for a specific answer. If the interviewee doesn’t get it, don’t\nworry about it. You can still get the job without getting the answer to this one.)\nInterviewee: Well, when I think about the information that I got early in the case, the only thing\nthat I have that really differentiates us from our competition is the fact that we have a food and\nbeverage portfolio. Maybe we can leverage the fact that we can distribute food products and\nbeverage products to restaurant customers to grow our market share?\nInterviewer: Yes, that’s right. So, how would you summarize your recommendation?\nInterviewee: Sure. The client wants to grow their market share in the food service segment.\nThe best way to do that would be to focus on the restaurant segment of the food service market,\nbecause that’s the largest part of the market—nearly 70%. Within that, the client should focus\non the non-fast food segments, as those segments aren’t dominated by our major competitor and\nare still up for grabs. And they’re growing faster than the traditional fast food segment. The best\nways to grow market share within those sub-segments—without hurting the bottom line—would\nbe to leverage the breadth of our portfolio, having both food and beverage products to offer\nwhich our competition does not, and perhaps by making custom products, where it doesn’t hurt\nour profit margins.",
  "Columbia_2006_Institutional Asset Manager Fees": "Case 18: Institutional Asset Manager Fees\nOVERVIEW\nFirm: BCG\nRound: 2006 FT, Final\nContent: Qualitative and quantitative\nCASE QUESTION\nBCG has been hired by an institutional asset manager client. The client is very profitable and\ndoing well. However, they know that they are leaving money on the table: they know that they\nhave a lower average percent fee of assets under management than their competition—lower\nthan the industry average. They’ve hired BCG to tell them why that is, but in the end we told\nthem more than that.\nINTERVIEWER BRIEFING\nRecommended Approach\nThis case dives right into data and question and answer. There’s a question that the client asked,\nbut the interviewer hinted up front in the case question that he/she wants the interviewee to do\nmore than just answer the client’s question. This is a good case for practicing looking at data\nand taking the case interview past answering the question and more towards “fixing” the\nbusiness problem.\nThe interviewer should expect the interviewee to drive the case, but should provide the data\n(exhibits 1 &2) up-front pretty quickly and make sure that the interviewee understands the\nindustry and how the fee structure works very early on.\nKey Facts\n- Institutional asset managers’ revenues are based on fees from clients. Clients are charged\na fee, which is structured by some percentage of assets under management. You can\nassume 5% if it makes the discussion easier—though, the percent fee never comes up.\n- Institutional asset management companies are companies like Fidelity. They can serve\nany sort of large, investing clients—pension funds, CalPers, TIA-CREF, hospitals,\nfoundations, universities, etc. They do have retail division that serve individuals with\ntheir 401Ks and mutual funds, b ut this case focuses on the institutional investor side of\nthe business.\nEXAMPLE DIALOGUE\nInterviewer: So, first do you have any questions?\nInterviewee: Sure, I want to make sure that I understand how the client’s business works. I\ndon’t know too much about institutional investors or asset managers; so, I’d like to just make\nsure that I understand the business model before we dive into the problem.\n\nInterviewer: Sure, that makes sense. What can I tell you?\nInterviewee: I imagine that an institutional asset manager is a company like a Fidelity, or\nCapital Group Companies.\nInterviewer: That’s right.\nInterviewee: And I bet that their clients can range from anyone—you and me investing our\nsavings in a mutual fund to large investors like pension funds.\nInterviewer: Yep, that’s right. Pension funds like TIA-CREF and CalPers, or foundations and\nuniversities are some of the bigger clients. We’re going to focus on that part of the business—\nthe institutional investor part of the business, not on you and me and our individual 401-Ks.\nInterviewee: Great. And you said that they generate revenues from fees which are based on a\npercent of assets under management?\nInterviewer: Right. What’s your sense of how that percent might change?\nInterviewee: My guess is that larger clients—clients with larger amounts of assets under\nmanagement—might have a lower percent fee charged to tem, because they still generate more\nrevenues with a smaller percent fee.\nInterviewer: That’s right. In fact, I have an exhibit that shows you what that looks like.\nExhibit 1\nRevenue Structure for Institutional Asset Management\nFee on\nAssets\nUnder\nManagement\n(%)\n$ Under\nManagement\nIt’s a stepped function. What would you image the cost structure of different size clients is like?\n\nInterviewee: Huh. Well, I don’t know the business to well, but I imagine that it costs about the\nsame to service a large client as it does a small one.\nInterviewer: Yes, that’s correct. So, what does that tell you?\nInterviewee: That tells me that large clients—in terms of assets under management—are highly\nprofitable because they generate more in revenues—even with smaller percentage fees—at\nbasically the same cost as a small client. Thinking back to the original question of the case: why\ndoes the client have a lower average fee than the rest of the industry, I now want to know more\nabout the fees that they’re charging different customers.\n(If the interviewee did not get these points, it’s not a big deal. But it is important to show them\nhow the fees are structured and explain that larger clients generate more revenues and cost the\nsame as any other client—therefore, they’re highly profitable clients.)\nInterviewer: That’s right on track. Let me show you some data that we collected on the percent\nfees—and discounts—that they’re giving to their customers.\nExhibit 2\nDiscounts by Deal\n100\n90\n80\n70\n%\nDiscount 60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n10 100 1,000 10,000\n$ Under Management\n(in MN)\nWhat does this data tell you?\nInterviewee: Well, it’s not what I would expect. It looks like they’re giving some of the highest\ndiscounts on their fees to their mid-sized clients, not to their largest ones. This may be keeping\nthe profitability high on their large clients, but it’s probably destroying margins on their mid-\n\nsized clients, and bringing down their overall fee average. I think this shows the answer to the\nclient’s question.\nInterviewer: Sure. Now here’s another question: if you were the client, what would you want to\nsee here?\n(Here, the interviewee should generate a few ideas. A bunch are listed—if they get one or two,\nthat’s great, and you can move on. Also, it might help the interviewee to give them the exhibit so\nthat they can draw on it—if that makes them more comfortable or helps them at all.)\nInterviewee: Well, I would want to see a few things. First, I would want to be giving the\nbiggest discounts, or the most discounts, to my larger clients. Here, it looks like they’re giving\nthe biggest discounts to the mid-sized clients. Second, there doesn’t seem to be any sort of cap\non the amount of discount that can be given. They’re discounting up to 90% in some cases—I\nwould think that that would destroy all profit margins. I would expect for there to be a cap\naround 30% or something. Last, it all seems pretty random where the discounts are given. I\nwonder whether the clusters of discounts represent a certain salesman/ account executive.\nInterviewer: That’s right. So, what are the key steps that you need to take to fix the problem?\nInterviewee: Well, first, you have to diagnose why the discounts are the way they are right now.\nSo, look-up who discounted what—see whether it’s saleperson-driven, or if it’s driven by the\ntype of client. Then, you would need to monitor the discounting and keep track of it. Maybe\nyou can incent the salespeople not to give discounts?\nInterviewer: Yep. That’s right: monitoring and tracking, and then put in whatever systems are\nnecessary to get the company’s average fee up to at least the industry average. Great. That’s it.",
  "Columbia_2006_Gumby’s Pizza": "Case 19: Gumby’s Pizza\nOVERVIEW\nFirm: Bain\nRound: 2006 FT, First\nContent: Qualitative and quantitative\nCASE QUESTION\nThis is a PE/ due diligence case. Bain has been hired by a private equity firm to evaluate\nwhether or not they should buy a mom and pop pizza chain that runs pizza restaurants primarily\nin college towns throughout the south. The mom and pop owners are retiring and have put the\nbusiness up for sale. The chain has about 30 stores and annual revenues of about $125 million.\nIn order for the private equity firm to want to buy this chain, they need to be able to double gross\nmargin in 3-5 years. They’re looking for 2-3 feasible ideas of how to do that, as they would like\nto sell the chain to another family owner in 3-5 years.\nINTERVIEWER BRIEFING\nThis is a profitability case, given that the PE firm is ultimately trying to double gross margin in\n3-5 years. Because of that, the framework used should be a typical profitability framework of\nrevenues and costs. Then, the interviewer would need to help focus the interviewee on the\nrevenues side of profitability, where the 3 C’s should be used to figure out what’s going on in the\nmarketplace. Once the interviewee has suggested that they’d like to look at profitability on any\nspecific level—store-level, town-level, customer-level, product-level, the interviewer can start to\nsupply exhibits to drive the case from there.\nEXAMPLE DIALOGUE\nInterviewee: It sounds like the client wants 2-3 ideas on how to double profitability, correct.\nInterviewer: Yes, that’s correct.\nInterviewee: So, profitability is composed of revenues and costs. On the revenues side, there’re\ntwo levers: price and volume. And on the costs side, there’s fixed and variable costs, or\ndepending on what kind of data we have, we could look at major line items on the balance sheet.\n(Note on laying out the costs side of the case: While McKinsey recommends a costs framework of\nfixed vs. variable costs, Interviewer often runs down the major line items on the balance sheet:\nlabor, materials, SG&A, PP&E. So, a respondent might want to consider using that layout to\ncosts—it seems less “business-school formulaic” and more real world, as costs would be derived\nfrom financial statements. However, because costs are not the main thrust of this case, it’s not a\nbig point here, but a plus for a Interviewer interviewer. Also, it helps if the interviewee actually\n\nsketches out their framework on a sheet of paper in landscape format—this shows that the\ninterviewee is thinking in “slide layout” format, which is what consulting is all about....)\nOne way to layout the case:\n• Price\nRevenues\n• Volume\nProfits\n• Fixed Costs\nCosts\n• Variable Costs\nOther way:\n• Price\nRevenues\n• Volume\nProfits\n• Raw Materials\nCosts\n• Labor\n• PP&E\n• SG&A\n\n(After laying out the profitability framework, you would need to state a hypothesis about which\nside—revenues or costs—you would like to focus on. It’s early in the case; so, really, just make\nan educated guess and proceed.)\nInterviewee: Because this is a private equity firm client, and they’re looking to double profits in\na short time period, I might focus on the costs side of the case, because it is usually easier to\nrealize cost synergies faster than revenue synergies.\nInterviewer: Actually, while that’s a good hunch about PE clients, in this particular case, there\nreally aren’t too many cost synergies to be had. It’d be better to focus on revenue gains. Given\nthat, how might you structure your inquiry?\n(While you can use either the 3 C’s or the 4P’s, I think that the 3 C’s work better for this case,\nbecause they provide a better overview of the marketplace and work nicely with the upcoming\nexhibits. But really, either would work, as they’re both marketing/ revenue-growth frameworks\nand that’s the real question being posed here.)\nInterviewee: I would look at three things, and several key questions in those buckets in order to\ngain a sense of the market and competitive landscape and how they might be able to grow\nrevenues. The large buckets are the following: 1) Competitive Landscape, 2) Customers and 3)\nCompany. Here’s how I might structure it, and some key questions that I’d like to ask in each\nbucket:\n3 C’s Framework with Key Questions\nCompetitive\nCustomers Company\nLandscape\n• National •What segments •How has the\ncompetitors? exist in the market? company’s\nChains? profitability varied\n• Students?\nover time?\n• Regional/ local\n• Faculty?\ncompetitors? •By store?\n• Others?\n• New entrants? •By region?\n• By product?\n\nInterviewer: That’s great. You brought up some interesting things. What kind of hypotheses do\nyou have about the competitive landscape?\n(At this point, the interviewee should use their common sense about pizza restaurants. The\nInterviewer interviewer is mainly trying to test their common sense and see what types of\nhypotheses the interviewee can generate. It’s fine- probably better--for this to be more of a\nconversation.)\nInterviewee: You mentioned that this is a mom and pop chain in southern college towns. I\nimagine that there are national chains that are also in those towns. I bet that those chains make\nthe market pretty price competitive. I also wonder whether there are other local mom and pop\nrestaurants in the towns that make competition even heavier.\nInterviewer: That’s great. We actually have some data on the competition.\nExhibit 1\nAverage Market Share by Customer Segment\n15 MM 6 MM 9 MM\n100%\n90%\n80% Papa Gino's\n70%\nPizza Hut\n60%\n50% Domino's\n40%\nOther\n30%\n20% Gumby's\n10%\n0%\nSt u d\ne\nnt\ns\nult y/\nSt\naff\no\nw n\nF\nol\nk\nc T\na\nF\nExhibit 2\nAverage Market Share by Segment\n13 MM 9 MM 4 MM\n100%\n90%\n80%\n70% Papa Gino's\n60% Pizza Hut\n50% Domino's\n40% Other\n30%\nGumby's\n20%\n10%\n0%\nDelivery Carry- Dine-In\nOut\n\nWhat kind of conclusions would you draw from this?\n(At this point, the interviewer should give the interviewee the two exhibits. The interviewee\nshould do a couple things. First, they should say what data is on each slide. That way, they\nshow that they are thinking out loud, and they are sure to not miss any data on the slides.\nSecond, they should make a summary of what the data on the slides tells them about the key\nquestion that they’re trying to answer here: can the client double profits by growing the revenues\nside significantly in the next 3-5 years? And then, the interviewee should definitely try to\nsynthesize at the end!)\nInterviewee: Well, Exhibit 1 tells me that Gumby’s has significant market share in the student\ncustomer segment—about 60%. It might be hard to grow it anymore in that segment. However,\nin the faculty/staff and town folk segments, there’s lots of room for Gumby’s to grow their\nshare—they’re down at about 30% amongst the faculty crowd and 5 % in the town folk crowd.\nHowever, the competitors in those segments look like national competitors like Dominos and\nPapa Gino’s—I imagine that those are pretty tough competitors—particularly on price. I also\nwould want to take into account the size of the segments in prioritizing them and trying to grow\nrevenues in them.\nExhibit 2 shows that we’re the strongest—with about a 40% market share—in the delivery\nsegment of the market. Luckily, that’s the largest segment. The dine-in segment looks like it’s\ndominated by a couple of the national chains, and it’s pretty small anyway. But the delivery and\ncarry-out segments seem more divided, still up for grabs.\nGiven this new info, if I wanted to grow revenues quickly for the client—I think they have a 3-5\nyear time frame, I would focus on growing Gumby’s share in the delivery and carry-out\nsegments, and with the faculty/ staff and maybe the town folk.\nInterviewer: That’s great. Is there any other information that you’d like to see in order to make\na more refined decision on who you would target and how to grow revenues?\n(This is where the interviewer wants to see the interviewee “drilling down” on their data and\nhypotheses. The interviewer is also looking for the interviewee to start synthesizing and tying all\nthe data and case together. It’s always great to refer back to the original question in the case—\nwhich was profitability, not revenues.)\nInterviewee: Well, the original question of the case was about profitability, not revenues. I\nmight want to understand more about which types of segments are the most profitable before\ndeciding where to grow my revenues. I mean, maybe the carry-out and delivery services have\ndifferent profit margins—I would want to know profitability by service type, or even customer\ntype, if that’s different.\nInterviewer: Well, that’s a good idea. Unfortunately, we don’t have exactly the profitability data\nthat you’re looking for, but we have something close to it—exhibits 3 and 4 have some\nprofitability data that may help you.\n\n(Now, the interviewer should give the interviewee the last two exhibits, and the interviewee\nshould go through the same exercise as before, but look to synthesize and wrap up the case.)\nExhibit 3\nRevenues by Customer Segment and Product\n15 MM 6 MM 9 MM\n14\n12\n10\nOther\n8 Drinks\n6 Sandwiches\nPizza\n4\n2\n0\nStudents Faculty/ Town Folk\nStaff\nExhibit 4\nProfitability by Product\n16\n14\nProfits\n12\n10 SG&A\n8\nRaw\n6 Materials\nLabor\n4\n2\n0\nPizza Sandwiches Drinks Other\nMargin: 33% 47% 53% 20%\nInterviewee: Well, exhibit 3 shows me the product mix by customer segment, and exhibit 4\nshows the profitability by product type. Taken together, these tell me that if I do want to target\nthe faculty/ staff and town folk to grow revenues that I really should do it by trying to get them to\nbuy more of the more profitable products—which are sandwiches and drinks, which have profit\nmargins of 47% and 53%.\nInterviewer: Yep, that’s right. Now how could you do that?\n\nInterviewee: You could offer coupons that encourage drink-buying, or even just mention that\nyou sell drinks when people place an order. You could offer more types of drinks—maybe\npeople would buy more drinks if they carried a wider variety? You could advertise that you have\nsandwiches—revenues for sandwiches are half that of pizza, they could probably really grow\nthat. Maybe they should change the name to “Gumby’s Pizza and Sandwiches.” Maybe they\ncould pepper the campus with flyers about sandwiches and drinks—that would help grow the\nmost profitable products amongst the two largest segments—students and faculty/ staff.\n(The interviewee should say a lot of ideas here—doesn’t matter how great they are, but\nInterviewer is looking for creativity and brainstorming here.)\nInterviewer: That’s enough ideas. Let’s focus on your drinks idea. Let’s say that Gumby’s\ncurrently sells each drink for $1/ drink. Say that they want to double their gross margins through\nselling drinks. How many drinks would they have to sell to do that?\nInterviewee: Well, at the beginning of the case, you said that their annual revenues were $125\nMN. It looks like from exhibit 4 that their gross margins right now are around 35%--is that\nabout right?\nInterviewer: Sure, 40% is about right—just to make it easier.\nInterviewee: So, their current profits are 40% of $125 MN, which is about $50 MN. In order to\ndouble that, they would need to make $50 MN more in profits on drinks. If the margins on drinks\nare 53% at $1/ drink, then, that would mean that they would need to sell about 100 million more\ndrinks each year. Right now, they’re selling about 3 million drinks; so, that seems really\nambitious—even over a 3-5 year time horizon.\nInterviewer: Right, so what does that tell you?\nInterviewee: Well, the initial question in the case was: should the PE client buy Gumby’s pizza?\nThe key question that we needed to answer was: are there 2-3 feasible ideas that could double\ngross margins in 3-5 years. We looked at growing profitability on the revenues side, and while it\nlooks like there’s room for Gumby’s to grow revenues—and profits—in customer segments like\nfaculty/ staff and town folk through highly profitable products like drinks and sandwiches, the\ngrowth that would be needed to meet the client’s time horizon and investment hurdle doesn’t\nseem feasible.\nInterviewer: So?\nInterviewee: I would recommend that they do not buy Gumby’s from the analysis that we did\ntoday.",
  "Columbia_2006_Insurance Company": "Case 21: Insurance Company\nOVERVIEW\nFirm: McKinsey and Company\nRound: 2006 FT, First\nContent: Qualitative\nCASE QUESTION\nOur client is a major Insurance company that sells insurance packages directly to corporations in\nthe west Pacific Rim. Their growth has been traditionally achieved in two ways:\n- Adding new accounts (adding more companies as their clients)\n- A growth within the account, i.e. the companies adding more employees to the insurance\nprogram.\nThere are a couple of trends in this market. First, it seems like companies are cutting back in\noffering their employees insurance program and there are many employees that are left with the\noption of either to pay for insurance themselves or stay without it. The second trend is that the\nlargest growing segment in the insurance market is people over 65 (note to interviewer: this\nmight have been a red herring).\nThe CEO of the company wants to know how they can increase their growth.\nSOLUTION\nThe interviewee should do a good job brainstorming different options for growing revenues.\nThis portion of the case is relatively open ended. Eventually, the interviewer presents a new\ntarget market and target financials, and the interviewee should successfully crunch the numbers.\nFinally, the interviewee should conclude by giving a supported opinion regarding whether the\nrequired market share is feasible.\nBreakdown of solution (including quantitative analyses and qualitative evaluations)\nInterviewer: What options can you think of to spur growth?\nInterviewee: brainstorms various qualitative options including:\n• Adding more accounts\n• Cross selling\n• Offering new products\n• Expanding geographically\n• Entering the private market\n• Merging, acquiring, etc\n\nInterviewer: Those all seem like reasonable options to consider. Now lets suppose we identified\nthe privately insured market as a good opportunity for our client, what issues should the client\nconsider before going in?\nInterviewee: Before entering the private market, we should consider various factors such as\nmarket trends and growth rate, competition, existing product offerings (and how they differ from\nthe client’s), different marketing methods (add telemarketers department), different distribution\nchannels, etc.\nInterviewer: We did some internal and external information gathering and came of with the\nfollowing figures. If our client wants to achieve incremental 10% profit growth over the next\nthree years, what growth rate does the target market need to experience? When determining\nthis, its reasonable to assume that we will capture a market share comparable to what we have\ntoday in the public market.\n(Addition information, if interviewee asks: profit growth rate from client’s current market is\nexpected to be 25% over the next 3 years.)\nInterviewer presents figures:\n20 million people Our Client:\nOther (over Num of people insured: 1 Million\n65, Military Medicaid,\netc), 12% 20%\nPremium revenues: 2 billion\nNot\nInsured,\nNet revenues: 200 million\n15%\nCompany\nInsurance, Privately\n50% Insured, 3%\nInterviewee: (Crunches the numbers)...\n• The market size of the privately insured market: 3% of market = 600,000 people\n• Company insured market size: 50% of 20 million = 10 million people\n• Our client market share: 1 million/10 million = 10%\n• Current profits: 200 million\n• Incremental profits from privately insured market in 3 years: 10% of 200 = 20 million\n• Current premium revenues = 2 billion = 1 million people X average premium\nThe average premium = 2 billion / 1 million = $2000\n• Client’s margins are: 200 million / 2 billion = 10%, i.e. client makes 10% X $2000 =\n$200 in profit from every insurance sold.\n\n• Client wants to achieve $20 million in incremental profits in the next 3 years, that is, he\nshould get an additional $20 million / $200 = 100,000 privately insured people.\n• If the client captures 10% of privately insured market then 100,000 people = 10% of this\nmarket which means that in 3 years, the privately insured market size will need to be 1\nmillion people.\nInterviewer: Good. Given the situation, how likely do you think it is that the market expands\nthat much over the next three years and our client captures 10% of the market.\nInterviewee: Given the trends in the market discussed earlier, I think it is reasonable that\n400,000 people would switch from public insurance to private insurance over the next three\nyears, thus boosting the private market to the target 1 million. Also, as our client already\nprovides so much insurance coverage, although indirectly through corporations, it seems\nlikely that a 10% market share can be achieved.",
  "Columbia_2006_Savvy Shoes": "Case 22: Savvy Shoes\nOVERVIEW\nFirm: N/A\nRound: 2006 FT,\nContent: Quantitative and qualitative\nCASE QUESTION\nOur client, Savvy Shoes, is US based manufacturer of casual mid-price leather shoes for men and\nwomen. It is a private company that has been in the founder’s family for 80 years. They\ncurrently do all manufacturing at company owned factories in China. The client wants to sell the\ncompany in 3 years, but, before doing so they target to double EBIT to achieve a higher selling\nprice. How could the client accomplish this?\nIndustry Background\nMature Market\n\nFragmented Market\n\n$1 B sales US retail market only\n\n50% Retail markup from wholesale\n\n5% growth per year\n\nSavvy Shoes\n30% of the current US wholesale market\n\nMain distribution is major department stores\n\n50% Gross margin\n\nSOLUTION\nThe interviewer should provide background numbers on the market. The interviewee should do\na good job driving through the numbers to find the company’s current and projected EBIT. Then\nthe interviewee should brainstorm options for growing the business. When presented with\nfurther information regarding new products, the interviewee should describe positive and\nnegative aspects of launching.\nBreakdown of solution (including quantitative analyses and qualitative evaluations)\nInterviewer: Let me provide you with some facts we have drawn out regarding the market, as\nwell as our clients operations. Go through the numbers and determine what our clients current\nEBIT, as well as its projected EBIT is 3 years from now, assuming it makes no changes in its\ncurrent business model?\n(presents figures mentioned above)\n\nInterviewee: Processes the numbers, determining the wholesale market size, client’s market\nshare, clients EBIT, and forecasted EBIT.\nRetail Market $1 Billion\n1. Wholesale Market $500 Million\nSavvy's market share in % 30%\n2. Savvy's market share in $ $150 Million\nGross Margin 50%\n3. Annual Profit $75 Million\nGrowth Rate 5%\n4. EBIT Year 1 $78.75\nEBIT Year 2 $82.69\nEBIT Year 3 $86.82\n* Note: Retail and Wholesale are different. Manufactures are often the wholesalers who sell to\nretailers. Thus retail buyers are direct customers.\nInterviewer: Those numbers look accurate, now lets talk about growing EBIT. What alternatives\nmight our client pursue with hopes of achieving this goal.\nInterviewee: Several alternatives are possible. These include:\n1. Extend product line\n2. Make private labels for other companies – Many retail companies look for\nopportunities to grow. One way is by selling footwear. For example, Polo casual shoe\ndivision is produced by an outside company.\n3. Become a licensee – similar to private label idea. However, this will create higher profit\nfor our client because licensing fee is usually 5-7% of total sales.\n4. Increase distribution channel – internet, mom and pop shops, boutiques. The industry\nis extremely fragmented. Use Savvy’s long family history and reputation as an\nadvantage.\n5. International Market – tap into the markets that are similar in fashion taste to the US\nmarket i.e. Canada. China might be a good choice too since our client’s goods are\nproduced there. In addition, China is a large market.\n6. etc.\n\nInterviewer: Lots of those sound interesting. We actually have already collected some\ninformation regarding possible new product launches. Based on this info, what are some of the\npros and cons of these two alternatives, and which would you recommend:\nLeather Accessories Market Higher-end shoes (evening\n(gloves, purses, wallets, shoes)\nbelts etc.)\nWholesale Market Size $500,000 $200,000\nGross Margin 40% 50%\nAnnual Growth 3% 15%\nOther Market Info Highly fragmented 3 major brands dominate\nthe market\nInterviewee: Based on the provided information, I think the pros and cons break down\nsomething like this:\nArguments for Leather Accessories:\nLarger wholesale market. Our client is looking for short term growth strategy and\n\nthis product would give higher profit.\nIt is a highly fragmented market thus with our clients reputable history and\n\nexisting relationships with buyers, our client can become a dominate player\nquickly.\nHigher probability of a consumer buying a pair of shoes and purse than two pairs\n\nof shoes in one shopping trip.\nIn fashion, it is difficult for a low end brand to trade up to a higher end market.\n\nArguments for Higher-end shoes:\nDon’t need to invest money on PPE. Our client can use current existing facility\n\nwith minor changes.\nHigher future growth.\n\nCan use the same sales force to sell the product.\n\nAlready have relationships with shoe buyers in department stores.\n\nOur client is known as a reputable shoe maker. The customers already know and\n\ntrust our brand and product.\nWeighing the two against each other, I would recommend targeting the X market for reasons A,\nB, and C.\n(Which market the interviewee actually selects is not as important as the clarity and content of\nthe argument presented)",
  "Columbia_2006_New England Retail Bank": "Case 23: New England Retail Bank\nOVERVIEW\nFirm: N/A\nRound: 2006 FT,\nContent: Quantitative and qualitative\nCASE QUESTION\nOur Client is a retail bank with operations in a number of states in the North East. While it does\nno commercial banking, its business is quite profitable. However, over the past year,\nprofitability has been declining.\nWe been brought in to diagnose the problem and offer recommendations to counter the trend.\nSOLUTION\nThe candidate should provide an overview of the factors that may be affecting profitability.\nIdeally these factors will be broken down in two buckets: Revenues and Costs.\nBreakdown of solution (including quantitative analyses and qualitative evaluations)\nInterviewee: Because this is a question of profitability, I’m going to dive into the revenue and\ncosts side of this business to find where the problems lie.\nLets start with costs. I imagine we could break cost down into buckets such as:\n• Capital intensiveness of operation (CapEx)\n• Sales force costs\n• Overhead\n• Technology costs\n• Internet operation costs, if any\nDo we know if the clients cost base has been increasing, and if so, in which area of its cost\nstructure?\nInterviewer: Its definitely a good idea to look into the costs side. We did as well and found that\nour client operated very efficiently, actually setting the benchmark in this industry for an\nefficient cost structure. Where else could the problem lie?\nInterviewee: Since cost is not the issue, I would want to determine what’s happening with the\nrevenues generated by the business. Again, I think we should try to bucket these if possible. I\nexpect drivers to break down into various categories:\n• Products offered\n\n• Profitability of products\n• Percentage of revenue coming from fees\n• Average profitability of client base\n• Client base growth\n• Average captured share of wallet\n• Customer perception of services offered\n• Quality of sales force\n• Geographic location strategy\n• Cross-selling capabilities\n(The candidate should discuss the bank’s cross-selling strategy. If he/she doesn’t, the\ninterviewer should point the candidate towards it by telling him that the average customer\nprofitability of other banks that offer similar products is higher than that of our client’s.)\nInterviewer: That list seems pretty exhaustive. We actually discussed a few of those options with\nthe bank’s CEO. She immediately got excited about the possibility of more effective cross\nselling. Currently, the bank was offering four products in the market:\n1. Deposits\n2. Loans\n3. Investments\n4. Life Insurance\nHow could we determine where the potential for cross selling is highest?\nInterviewee: In order to determine the potential for cross selling, I would want to explore some\ninternal and external factors of our clients business including:\n• Products we are already selling to our clients, and which percentage of our clients owns\neach product.\n• Average profitability of each product\n• Competitive landscape and customer perception for each product\n• Market segment growth\nInterviewer: Let me provide you with some additional information we have collected regarding\nthe products offered by our client. What conclusions can you draw from this info:\nDeposits Loans Investments Life Insurance\n% of Clients\n100% 50% 7% 1%\nAverage\nROE 25% 16% 14% 5%\nCompetitive\nPosition High High Medium Medium\nMarket\nGrowth 3% 4% 7% 3%\n\nInterviewee: (taking a moment to synthesize the data...) Based on the chart, I would conclude\nthat targeting the investment products for cross selling would be the most effective approach.\nThis product has a low penetration in the current client base, a relatively high ROE, and solid\ngrowth expectations going forward.\nThe chart also mentions that our clients competitive in this product is only “medium”, which\nbegs the question why not “high”? I would want to explore this further. We could probably start\nwith several hypothesized explanations and try to prove them true or false. Possible explanations\nmight be:\n• The Bank is new in the business and is perceived as just an “S&L” institution.\n• The Bank’s competitors place strong emphasis in these products\n• Customers prefer to hold their Investment products with a commercial bank\n• The Bank’s client base simply is not used to Investment-type products\n• The Bank’s sales force is not correctly pushing the Investment products, which may be\nbecause they lack the correct incentives.\n(The candidate should also realize that Life Insurance is hard to bundle with other products, as\nit is a very specialized service for which people normally don’t refer to their retail bank.)\nInterviewer: The bank’s CEO has now come to us, still high on the prospects of cross selling.\nShe wants to generate at least $50 M in additional profit per annum by persuing this strategy.\nHow many additional customers would we need to meet this goal?\nAdditional Information – Provide only if the candidate asks for it\n• Number of existing customers: 1 million\n• Average investment per customer in the Investments segment: $50,000 (*)\n• Average profit from additional dollar cross-sold: 0.4% (**)\n(*) Provide this information if the candidate cannot come up with a reasonable estimate.\n(**) The candidate should understand the difference between this number and the 14% ROE\nfrom the table.\nNecessary Calculations\nAverage profit per customer: $50,000*0.4% = $200\nNumber of additional customers required to reach $50m: $50,000,000/$200 = 250,000\nThe math in this case is very straightforward, so the candidate should focus on stepping back\nand interpreting the numbers and the feasibility of the CEO’s ambitions.\nInterviewee: What I have been able to determine is that there are currently 70,000 customers\n(1,000,000*7%) that hold Investment products and by increasing that number by 250,000\n(~260%) to meet the CEO’s goal in one year probably doesn’t is not possible.\n\nInterviewer: On the way to a meeting, you run into the CEO in the elevator. He wants to know\nwhat the latest status is. What do you tell him?\nInterviewee: We’ve looked at the market for cross selling and finished running the numbers.\nWe have concluded that:\n• Reaching an additional $50m in one year by cross-selling Investment products is not\nreasonable\n• Cross-selling remains attractive given the market’s conditions\n• The bank needs to improve its competitive position in the Investment segment, but\nfurther analysis is required to address this issue.",

  "Illinois_2015_2016_Water & Bottle": "Water & Bottle\n\nWater & Bottle\nCase Introduction\nWater & Bottle is a leading original equipment manufacturer of water bottles in the United States. Founded\nfive years ago, Water & Bottle saw tremendous growth in its first two years and has since seen its growth\nstagnate to about 5% growth per year as competitors have entered the water bottle industry and are\ncommanding lower premiums to manufacture similar water bottles.\nWater & Bottle is considering spending a significant amount of time and money to launch an add-on to its\nexisting product offering this year that would help filter the water as it is consumed. The CEO of Water &\nBottle thinks that this add-on would provide the company with a significant increase in revenue as it would\nbe a proprietary add-on that the other manufacturers wouldn’t be able to replicate.\nThe CEO has come to us looking for some input on whether or not launching this add-on is a good idea.\nQuestion 1\nPart of the problem that Water & Bottle is facing stems from the lower premiums being commanded by\nother manufacturers. As an OEM, Water & Bottle is struggling with the increase of Original Design\nManufacturers that are entering the market, specifically overseas and selling in the United States. What\nmight these other manufacturers be doing differently that allows them to command lower premiums?\nSuggested Answer\n- Potential Clarification\no OEM: a company that makes a product and then sells it under its own brand.\no ODM: a company that makes and designs a product that will be branded by\nanother company for sale\n- Lower R&D expenses allow them to charge a lower price and still make more money\n- Automation of the production procedure requires lower payroll costs\n- Materials used might be cheaper due to being inferior or producing a higher quantity thus\nallowing a discount\n- The competitors are manufacturing the water bottles abroad and are taking advantages of\ncurrency differences or lower costs of production in that country\nQuestion 2\nWater & Bottle has thought about moving into the original design manufacturer. This would allow Water\n& Bottle to contract with other companies to manufacture their version of the water bottle while still\nmaking a portion of the money. What might Water & Bottle consider when doing this?\nSuggested Answer\n- Prices that can be charged for the manufacturing of the product\n- How big the contract order might be for and how this impacts the bottom line for Water &\nBottle\n- Capacity to produce water bottles for other companies and the impact of this on Water &\nBottle’s production\n- Quality issues that might arise with higher production numbers and external expectations\n\nQuestion 3\nWater & Bottle has produced 350,000 water bottles since its inception and secondary manufacturers have\nproduced 250,000 water bottles. Water & Bottle expects to be able to capture 25% of the total market in\nyear one and 35% of the total market by year two. Additionally, Water & Bottle expects to increase overall\nsales by an additional 10% in year two as customers will be specifically interested in this add-on. After\nthat, Water & Bottle expects competitors to enter this market with their version of the add-on. When\nlooking at producing this add-on, how large of a market is Water & Bottle looking at?\nSuggested Answer\nCurrent Add-On Adoption EOY2 Add-On\nCustomers Rate Sales\n(600,000) (35%) (210,000)\nYear 1 Growth\nWater bottles Year 1 Sales\nYear 1 Growth Rate\n(30,000)\n(5%)\nPotential\nYear 2 Growth Add-On Adoption EOY 2 Add-On\nCustomers Year 2 Sales\nRate Rate Sales\n(31,500)\n(5%) (35%) (21,525)\nYear 2 Growth\nYear 2 Growth EOY2 Add-On\nYear 2 Sales Add-On Adoption\nRate Sales\n(63,000) Rate (100%)\n(10%) (63,000)\nTotal Add-On Sales: 294,525 – looking for an exact number\nQuestion 4\nBased off the total amount of add-on sales that you have predicted, the CEO would like us to determine\nwhether or not manufacturing and producing the add-on would be a good idea. How would you go about\nsolving this? Please justify your answer.\nSuggested Answer\n- Information necessary to answer this (only give if they ask)\no Total development costs would amount to $4.5 million\no Individual product costs would amount to $5\no Water & Bottle expects to sell these products for $20\no Water & Bottle has determined the maximum payback period for this to be two\nyears due to competitor involvement\n- It would be wise to calculate the break-even point. The breakeven point would be found\nby taking $4.5 million and divide it by the contribution margin of $15 ($20 selling price -\n$5 variable costs). This amounts to 300,000 units. With a two-year payback period, this\nis not feasible.\n\nQuestion 5\nEven though the add-on doesn’t meet the required payback period that the CFO as suggested, the CEO\nwould still like to find a way to make the add-on work. What might be some ways to do this?\nSuggested Answer\n- Raise the price that the add-on sells for\n- Lower the costs of manufacturing each add-on\n- Consider holding off on launching this first year and launch in subsequent years to take\nadvantage of a larger market\n- Offer some sort of incentive for existing customers to purchase the add-on through a\nmarketing campaign to increase overall add-on sales\nQuestion 6\nWhat might Water & Bottle do to slow down the competitors’ encroachment upon its sales?\nSuggested Answer\n- Consider a partnership to split the development costs or revenues of launching the add-\non with them\n- Outsource manufacturing of the original water bottle to them\n- Sue for damages regarding intellectual property infringement\nQuestion 7\nAfter some research, your team has found some promising research about contract manufacturers in this\nspace. Specifically, BAB Contract Co. is interested in growing its manufacturing of water bottle add-ons.\nWhat would be the process that Water & Bottle should go through when determining whether or not to\nsign a contract with BAB Contract Co.?\nSuggested Answer\nSteps should include:\n- Determining the cost of the contract\no Fixed cost vs variable cost\no Compare this to the cost of producing internally\n- Assessing the quality of the product that would be manufactured\n- Quantifying whether or not BAB Contract Co. has the capacity to produce these add-ons\n- Understand how this contract would impact Water & Bottle’s reputation\nQuestion 8\nThe CEO of Water & Bottle is coming in for a presentation. Please give him an overview of your findings.\nSuggested Answer\n- Based on the research that has been conducted, Water & Bottle should not launch the\nwater bottle Add-On. We found that that overall market for the add-on is under 300,000\nunits which is below the breakeven point timeframe allotted by the client. Instead, we\nsuggest working with the other manufacturers on creating some sort of partnership to sell\n\nmore Water bottles and perhaps split the overall development costs of the add-on.\nMoving forward, it’s important to have a discussion with the other manufacturers to see if\nthey are interested in working together and go from there. Some risks include tipping off\nthe competition about future plans, as well as experiencing periods of slower growth in\nthe future if things go wrong.",

  "Illinois_2015_2016_Sloan Clinic": "Sloan Clinic\nPWC STYLE CASE\n0 | Pag e\n\nSloan Clinic\nCase Introduction\nSloan Clinic is a large hospital and specialty clinic in Chicago, Illinois. Sloan Clinic currently\nhas a hospital that has a top of the line surgical facility as well as a fast paced emergency\nroom. Sloan Clinic is also famous for their specialty clinics with over 40 physicians and over\n35 specialties to help patients in need. They are known nationally for their focus on research,\nwhich attracts top of the line physicians. This includes areas in cardiology, neurology, and\nRadiation Oncology. Sloan Clinic has been in operation since 1940 and continues today to\nhave loyal patients. They are known for their state-of-the-art technology as well as their\npatient culture. They will work with a patient until the end.\nThe Hospital Administrator, Christina Grey, of Sloan Clinic is currently looking to expand. She feels that\nthe clinic is not fully able to provide for it’s patients. She feels there is more potential for the company, but\nis not exactly sure in what area. Christina hired a team 5 years ago to track the analytics of the clinic and\ncompared to nearby clinics.\nNow that 5 years of data has been collected, Christina feels it is time to consider a major expansion. There\nare two different options that seem ideal based on what she knows of other competitors in the Chicagoland\narea. Christina has come to you to help give her a recommendation on which area she should expand in\nbased on the data she has received.\nExpansion 1:\nThe first option is to expand their trauma center to reduce wait times for patients. Currently the hospital\nemergency room operates at full capacity. While patients are never turned away, the wait times have clearly\ngotten out of hand. It is to the point that they feel they are no longer the top preference for emergency\nrooms. Currently, the emergency room treats all walk in patients ranging from traumas to minor colds. The\nexpansion plan will include a new wing to the emergency room that will host 50 more patients per hour.\nThis will also include another surgical operating room as well. Further, with the expansion Sloan Clinic\nexpects to have to hire 25 more nurses and 10 more physicians or physician assistants.\nExpansion 2:\nThe second option is to open a convenient care clinic. This convenient clinic would be connected with the\nspecialty clinics instead of directly with the hospital. The clinic would only be open 12 hours per day 7 days\nper week and would require 3 nurses and 2 physicians or physician assistants at all times. The clinic would\nprovide assistance for concerns that are not an emergency including but not limited to: colds, infections,\nand rashes.\nMore information on Expansion 1 and 2 can be found below. It is important to note that if there is no\nexpansion, there will still be additional costs due to needed updates and upkeep of the clinic.\n1 | Pag e\n\nICA Strategy: Quick Assessment\nSloan Clinic has come to you asking for a recommendation as to what expansion they should proceed with\nbased on the data given. They have given you two days to come up with a recommendation with supporting\nfacts. While they have the data and the expansion ideas they are very much unsure of what they should do\nand feel your team is the best suited to find the solution. They would like to understand your decision before\nproceeding with the rest of the project.\nBelow are a few specific questions they would like addressed in two days that can act as a guideline for your\npresentation.\no What is the best option financially, weighing the initial investment against the long term potential\nrevenues?\no How do the different expansions compare to other clinics in the area?\no What are other potential ways to internally reduce the wait time for Sloan Clinic?\no What recommendation do you believe is the best for Sloan Clinic?\nTask: Prepare a rough draft of handwritten (or computer-generated) slides to share with the\nhospital administrator. You will have 15 minutes to present.\nBelow is an appendix with information about the projects.

However, the board of directors believe an expansion could help save the hospital from future issues of budget constraints once it is\nfully implemented. Christina has currently come up with two solutions to this issue, but has not had time to find the given data to back up her\nclaims. The board of directors has not set a price to their contribution, as it contingent on how soon the expansion is able to progress. What is the\nlength of each project and how long will it take the raise the additional money?\n- Find outside sourcing via external donators and fundraising events.\n- If Christina includes a research portion to the added expansions at an additional initial investment of $2,000,000 she believes she\nwill be able to find government funding for the project.\n3 | Pag e\n\nInterview Guide\n1. Exhibit 1 is used to understand where Sloan Clinic is struggling and could change their allocation of patients. It should be noticed that 35%\nof their patients do not need to be using the emergency room but they are because there is not an option to otherwise.\n2. Exhibit 2 focuses on the wait time of each patient. They should notice that there is an extreme wait time for the emergency room compared\nto its competitors.\n3. Brainstorming:\na. Call ahead service for patients who are on their way to the hospital\nb. Dial a Nurse for patients who do not feel they are in need of medical attention; they just need advice.\nc. Pre Registration so no paperwork needs to be filled out at the place.\nd. Online Cancellation for patients who decide to cancel appointments.\ne. Etc.\n4. Exhibit 3\na. Net Present Value can be calculated if they would like to find the ideal Cost of Capital for Sloan Clinic. If they decide to use a Cost\nof Capital an explanation should be made.\nb. The Interviewer can also find the breakeven point.\nc. Break Even Points:\ni. Expansion 1: 4.72 years\nii. Expansion 2: 3.52 years\niii. No Additional Expansion: 0 years\n5. Answer: Either Expansion could work, but it should be clear as to why there needs to be an expansion. It should be allocated so there are\nless wait times and either would contribute. Knowing that 35% of its patients do not need trauma and that other competitors have\nconvenient cares makes convenient cares seem like a logical approach given the information here.\n6.

One Deloitte, and Green Dot both refer to Deloitte’s internal\nefforts to keep practioners aware of the other Deloitte pillars. Deloitte also offers tax, advisory and\naccounting services. Within consulting, Deloitte offers technology strategy, human capital, and\nstrategy and operations work.\nThe Deloitte information is sourced from Welcome to Deloitte, as remembered by JD\nGoals\n- Ensure that the interviewee can brainstorm effectively\n- Ensure that the interviewee understands how to create a list of stakeholders, and what\ncommunication channels are effective\n- Ensure that the interviewee understands SDLC; this means they understand the steps, and that\nthe process must be followed. This cases focuses primarily on early SDLC work.\no SDLC Steps:\n Requirement Analysis\n Design\n Build\n Test\n Rollout\n Cutover/Knowledge Transfer\n- The tone of the case is conversational\n\nProblem Statement\nYour client is Phone Co, a cellphone provider, and is one of the four companies that dominates the\nindustry. Phone Co. has met with success in their efforts to change the tone and business model of the\nindustry by working to make contracts more flexible and empowering the customer to serve themselves\nwherever possible. In the process of enacting these changes, Phone Co. has realized that their current\ntechnology infrastructure cannot support the scale of business that they want to continue.\n- Their product offerings are fragmented, offering over 3,000 separate plans\n- Their current backend systems don’t have capability to create new plan functionalities\n- Their customer data is tied to a phone, rather than a person\n- Their website is challenging to use and offers limited functionality – necessitating the use of in\nperson representatives, and creating more hassles for the customer\nAs a result of these hurdles, Phone Co has decided to entirely upgrade its technology infrastructure, on\nboth the front end and back ends of the system.\nQuestion 1\nThe first portion of Deloitte’s Statement of Work deals with choosing an appropriate vendor to build the\ntechnology infrastructure for itself. Phone Co does not have the resources to create enterprise level\narchitecture in-house, so they will award a contract to a vendor of their choosing, and work closely with\nthem to ensure smooth implementation of the new system. What factors would you consider when\nselecting a vendor, and what steps would you take in selecting the vendor?\nFactors to Consider, taken from Deloitte’s vendor selection PowerPoint\n- Business Fit\n- Ease of Implementation\n- Technical performance\n- Scalability\n- Timing\n- Costs\nSteps, From Deloitte’s vendor selection PowerPoint\n1. Identify the organization’s strategic and future goals\n2. Assess the current functionalities offered by the client’s current technology footprint\n3. Develop ideal future state capabilities\n4. Build a roadmap for the implementation of new capabilities\n5. Develop RFP, and select vendors that meet the roadmap\nAs the interviewee explains these ideas, please choose a few for them to explain more in depth. Keep\nyour questions geared towards generating more analysis, and push them to think outside the box and\nexpand on their solutions. Move on to the next question whenever you’re ready.\nQuestion 2\nThe leadership of Phone Co. is of the opinion that successful implementation of this project is vital to the\nsurvival of their firm. To that end, they want to ensure that all of the key players involved are on the same\npage, and that all the major stakeholders are communicated to. Who are the major stakeholders in this\nprocess?\n\nIf the interviewee clearly does not structure their list of stakeholders, ask them to first identify the three\nplayers – Deloitte, Phone Co, and their vendor\nStakeholders\nThe interviewee should provide a logical structure that encompasses most of the following:\n- Phone Co.\no Top level leadership – CSuite\no Project liaison, who Deloitte teams report to\no SMEs\no Development teams\no Front-line managers\n- Deloitte\no Partners\no Managers\no Consultants\n- Vendor\no Development teams\no Leadership\nAs the interviewee explains these ideas, please choose a few for them to explain more in depth. Keep\nyour questions geared towards generating more analysis, and push them to think outside the box and\nexpand on their solutions. Move on to the next question whenever you’re ready.\nQuestion 3\nThe CEO is on board with the changes that have been proposed, however she has been hearing disquieting\nrumors. It seems that the low to mid-level employees in the company have become disenchanted with this\ntechnology overhaul. They expect nothing to come of it, and no significant progress to be made. How\nshould the CEO handle this, and build consensus within the company? What channels of communication\nshould she use?\nSuggested Answer\n- Convince workers of the need for change,\no Use your CEO heavily as a cheerleader, or mascot for the new overhaul. Have\nthem visible to the company, and excited about the progress\no Also work to brand the company as change friendly, and progressive so that\nworkers fighting change seem archaic\n- Create some quick success that can be showed off\no Allocate resources to an easy part of the project (ie UI design) and show off that\nsuccess\no Change the scope of the project to only focus on vital areas, and in doing so, push\nthose areas through more quickly.\n- Involve more of the workforce in planning.\no Hold open re-plan meetings that any employee can participate in\no Engage in periodic updates to the entire workforce on the progress, and next\nobjectives of the plan.\nChannels of communication\n- Mass communications, ie letters from the CEO\n\n- Hold focus groups\n- Create teams of people who are on board with the process, and use them as advocates\nAs the interviewee explains these ideas, please choose a few for them to explain more in depth. Keep\nyour questions geared towards generating more analysis, and push them to think outside the box and\nexpand on their solutions. Move on to the next question whenever you’re ready.\nQuestion 4\nAfter an appropriate vendor has been selected, Phone Co. needs help determining how to migrate their\ncustomer data from the old system, to the new. Migration across systems is a risky, time-constrained\nendeavor. If any customer data is corrupted it guarantees the loss of the customer, and since customer\nrecords are inaccessible during the period, they cannot be billed for usage in the migration period; this\nresults in losses of revenue for every second that the migration period lasts. Given these concerns, and the\nurgent need for migration, how would you implement their migration strategy?\nA Good Answer would include:\n- A discussion of the three choices: big bang, phased rollout, and pilot.\n- An explanation for why big bang is completely unsuitable\n- The use of a pilot program to verify that the transfer program works, and then a phased\nrollout keeping individual migration windows as short as possible.\n- Segmenting their customers by loyalty and migrating them in these segments to reduce\nrisk\nAs the interviewee explains these ideas, please choose a few for them to explain more in depth. Keep\nyour questions geared towards generating more analysis, and push them to think outside the box and\nexpand on their solutions. Move on to the next question whenever you’re ready.\nQuestion 5\nThe CEO of Phone Co. is impressed with your work. Unfortunately, the teams under the CEO don’t believe\nthat there is a plan in place to successfully implement this change. Please summarize your plans, and\nconvince them that this project can be implemented successfully with Deloitte.\nA Good Answer would include:\n- A discussion of why organizational change is necessary\n- A strategy for vendor selection\n- Plans for dealing with people who aren’t very happy with this process\n- Risks and next steps\nThe key here is that the most important parts of the case are recognized by the interviewee and\ncommunicated in a clear and concise fashion.",

For example, it is expensive to build brands (advertising, marketing, etc.) and with theconvergence of OTC and Prescription putting pricing pressures on Prescription, they should consider whetherbranded products will continue to command a premium.\nA great answer would also use information from the Data Sheet to make a hypothesis. For example, the client’s highmanufacturing costs (as mentioned in the case) would make it difficult for them to compete in the generic/Private\nLabel market even though this is a growing area. If growth was strong enough, it may be worth exploring movingmanufacturing facilities to lower cost areas. However, this could impact their physician relationships.\nThey should also consider the goal of doubling revenue in the next 5 years and which channels will help to achievethat goal. While the branded prescription market may fit their existing capabilities, it is the smallest and slowestgrowing market. OTC on the other hand, may better support their top line goals\n\nCase 14: Skin Care Market (Deloitte)\nKey elements to analyze\nQuestion #3\nGiven the client’s current capabilities and aggressive growth target, if they decide to enter this market, what factorsshould drive their decision to explore other Geographic markets versus staying in Europe?\nNotes to Interviewer\nA good answer would point out that Europe is a small portion of the Global Market (20%) with stagnated growth\n(5%) while the US makes up 40% of the market with a 10% growth rate. They may also consider the fact that thelarger size, higher growth markets (US and Emerging) also have the lowest margins which may not play into theirhigher cost model. Other considerations are barriers to entry, competition in each country, and the increased costand complexity of distributing product overseas.\nA great answer will also point out that Europe is only 20% of the $30B industry ($6B), broken into four channels.\nEven if they owned the entire Generic OTC market (which is the largest channel), assuming the geographicalproportions hold across channels, they would have 20% of a $10B market ($2B) which doesn’t even get them to halfof their growth target. This would tell you that you would need to be a significant global player to come even closeto your goals or at least pursue additional opportunities simultaneously.\n\nCase 14: Skin Care Market (Deloitte)\nKey elements to analyze\nQuestion #4\nWith the limited information and data available about the client and the consumer skin care industry, do you thinkexpansion into this market is a good idea?\nNotes to Interviewer\nA good answer would defend a single position one way or the other. They might take into consideration that this is ahighly fragmented market with relatively strong growth (7% CAGR) and which will provide them with theopportunity to break into larger markets in other geographic regions once they get a foothold in Europe. Theproducts seem to align with the manufacturing capabilities (lotions, ointments, and creams) and sales channels\n(Physicians). On the other hand, they might indicate that this is not an attractive market because their currentcapabilities are best at Branded Prescriptions, which is the smallest and slowest growing part of the industry. As aresult, it will not help them achieve their revenue targets in any significant way. Or they may point out that this is alower margin business which will lower overall profit margins.\nA great answer would weigh both the pros and the cons before taking a position. They may also ask what thealternative investment options are. They currently enjoy good margins as a large player in a fragmented industry.\nShould they explore more options there?",
  "NYU_Stern_2015_2016_Case 15: Great Burger (McKinsey)": "Case 15: Great Burger (McKinsey)\nIntroduction\nCase Prompt\nLet’s assume our client is Great Burger (GB) a fast food chain that competes head–to-head with McDonald’s,\nWendy’s, Burger King, KFC, etc. GB is the fourth largest fast food chain worldwide, measured by the number of storesin operation. As most of its competitors do, GB offers food and “combos” for the three largest meal occasions:\nbreakfast, lunch and dinner. Even though GB owns some of its stores, it operates under the franchising businessmodel with 85% of its stores owned by franchisees (individuals own & manage stores and pay a franchise fee to GB,\nbut major business decisions e.g. menu, look of store, are controlled by GB).\nAs part of its growth strategy GB has analyzed some potential acquisition targets including Heavenly Donuts (HD), agrowing doughnut producer with both a US and international store presence. HD operates under the franchisingbusiness model too, though a little bit differently than GB. While GB franchises restaurants, HD franchises areas orregions in which the franchisee is required to open a certain number of stores.\nGB’s CEO has hired McKinsey to advise him on whether they should acquire HD or not.\nCase Tracker\n• Led By: Interviewer • Level of Difficulty: Hard\n• Industry: Fast Food • Case Type: Acquisition\n\nCase 15: Great Burger (McKinsey)\nKey elements to analyze\nQuestion #1\nWhat areas would you want to explore to determine whether GB should acquire HD?\nNotes to Interviewer\nStand alone value of HD Synergies/strategic fit\n• Growth in market for doughnuts • Brand quality similar?

What does this imply for future • Synergies (Note to interviewer: do not let candidategrowth? dive deep on this, as it will be covered later)\n• Profitability/profit margin\nSynergies/strategic fit\n• Capital required to fund growth (capital investment toopen new stores, working capital) • GB experience with mergers in past/experience inintegrating companies\nManagement team/cultural fit\n• Franchise structure differences.

Here are some keyfacts on GB and HD. (Note to interviewer: show candidate Exhibit #1)\nWhat potential synergies can you think of between GB and HD?\nNotes to Interviewer\nLower costs Increase revenues\n• Biggest opportunity likely in corporate SG&A by • Sell doughnuts in GB stores, or some selected GBintegrating corporate management products in HD stores\n• May be some opportunity to lower food costs with • GB has much greater international presence thus likelylarger purchasing volume on similar food items (e.g., has knowledge/skills to enable HD to expand outsidebeverages, deep frying oil), however overlaps may be of North Americalow as ingredients are very different • GB may have superior skills in identifying attractive\n• GB appears to have an advantage in property and locations for stores as its sales/store are higher thanequipment costs which might be leverage-able to HD industry average, where as HD’s is lower than industry\n(e.g., superior skills in lease negotiation) average – might be able to leverage this when openingnew HD stores to increase HD average sales/store\n• Expand HD faster then it could do on own – GB as alarger company with lower debt may have betteraccess to capital\n\nCase 15: Great Burger (McKinsey)\nKey elements to analyze\nQuestion #3\nThe team thinks that with synergies, it should be possible to double HD’s US market share in the next 5 years, andthat GB’s access to capital will allow it to expand number HD of stores by 2.5 times. What sales/store will HD requirein 5 years in order for GB to achieve these goals? You should assume:\n• Doughnut consumption/capita in the US is $10/year today, and is projected to grow to $20/year in 5 years\n• For ease of calculation, assume US population is 300 M\n• Use any data from Exhibit #1 you need\nNotes to Interviewer\nNote to interviewer -\nVariable Source (given in case unless stated) Valuean optional probing\nHD sales Exhibit 1 $700M question is to ask:\n• Does this seem\nUS market (Consumption per capita) x (population) $3Breasonable?\nHD market share (HD sales) / (US market) 23%\nA good response\nNote to interviewer: At this stage, tell the candidate to round to 25% for the sake of simplicitywould be:\nUS market in 5 years (Projected consumption per capita) x (population) $6B Yes, given it impliesless than double\nHD sales in 5 years if double (Current share, calculated as 25%) x (double) x (US\n$3B same store salesmarket share market in 5 years)\ngrowth and per\n# of stores in 5 years (Current # stores from Exhibit 1) x (2.5) 2,500 capita consumptionis predicted to\nSales/store in 5 years (HD sales in 5 years) / (new number of stores) $1.2Mdouble\n\nCase 15: Great Burger (McKinsey)\nKey elements to analyze\nQuestion #4\nOne of the synergies that the team thinks might have a big potential is the idea of increasing the businesses’ overallprofitability by selling doughnuts in GB stores. How would you assess the profitability impact of this synergy?\nNotes to Interviewer\nBasic profitability analysis Cannibalization\n• Calculate incremental revenues by selling doughnuts in • If the candidate dives deep in the incremental revenue\nGB stores (calculate how many doughnuts per store, piece by taking into account cannibalization, whattime s price per doughnut, times number of GB stores) would be the rate of cannibalization with GB offerings?\n• Calculate incremental costs by selling doughnuts in GB Doughnut cannibalization will be higher with breakfaststores (costs of production, incremental number of products than lunch and dinner products, etc.\nemployees, employee training, software changes, • One way to calculate this cannibalization is to look atincremental marketing and advertising, incremental historic cannibalization rates with newcost of distribution if we can not produce doughnuts in product/offering launchings within GB storeshouse, etc.) • Might also cannibalize other HD stores if they are\n• Calculate incremental investments. Do we need more nearby GB stores – could estimate this impact byspace in each store if we think we are going to attract seeing historical change in HD’s sales when competitornew customers? Do we need to invest in store layout doughnut store opens near byto have in house doughnut production? • Other reasonable approaches to calculating\n• Other reasonable answers are acceptable cannibalization are acceptable\n\nCase 15: Great Burger (McKinsey)\nKey elements to analyze\nQuestion #5\nNote to interviewer: Only do this question if you feel you did not get a good read with the first quantitative question,\nor if you have ample time left for the case. If you skip this question, tell the candidate the following: The team hascalculated that the incremental profit per GB store from selling HD doughnuts would be $15K.\nWhat would be the incremental profit per store if we think we are going to sell 50 thousand doughnuts per store at aprice of $2 per doughnut at a 60% margin with a cannibalization rate of 10% of GB’s sales?\n(Note to interviewer: show candidate Exhibit #2. Also, if necessary, explain the “Cannibalization Rate” to thecandidate)\nNotes to Interviewer\nIncremental profit = contribution from HD sales less contribution lost due to cannibalized GB sales\n= 50K units x $2/unit x 60% margin – 300K units x 10% cannibalization x $3/unit x 50% margin\n= $60K – 45K\n= 5K incremental profit/store\n\nCase 15: Great Burger (McKinsey)\nKey elements to analyze\nQuestion #6 (Synthesis)\nYou run into the CEO of GB in the hall. He asks you to summarize McKinsey’s perspective so far on whether GBshould acquire HD. Pretend I am the CEO - What would you say?\nNotes to Interviewer\n• Note to interviewer: This is an example response. Good answers may vary, depending on answers candidate gavein questions 1-4, and whether or not they completed all previous questions.\n• Early findings lead us to believe acquiring HD would create significant value for GB, and that GB should acquire HD\n• We believe it is possible to add $15k in profit/GB store by selling HD in GB stores. This could mean $50\nmillion in incremental profit for North American stores (where immediate synergies are most likely given HDhas little brand presence in rest of world.\n• We also believe there are other potential revenue and cost synergies that the team still needs to quantify\n• Once the team has quantified the incremental revenues, cost savings, and investments, we will make arecommendation on the price you should be willing to pay\n• We will also give you recommendations on what it will take to integrate the two companies in order to capture thepotential revenue and cost savings, and also to manage the different franchise structures and potentially differentcultures of GB and HD\n\nCase 15: Great Burger (McKinsey)\nExhibit #1\n(to be handed to the candidate)\nExhibit #1\nStores GB HD Financials GB HD\nTotal 5,000 1,020 Total store sales $5,500M $700M\n- North America 3,500 1,000 Parent company revenues $1,900M $200M\n- Europe 1,000 20 Key expenses (% sales)\n- Asia 400 0 – Cost of sales * 51% 40%\n- Other 100 0 – Restaurant operating\n24% 26%\ncosts\nAnnual Growth in Stores 10% 15%\n– Restaurant property &\n4.6% 8.5%\nequipment costs\n– Corporate general &\n8% 15%\nadministrative costs\nProfit as % of sales 6.3% 4.9%\nSales/store $1.1M $0.7M\nIndustry average $0.9M $0.8M\n* Variable costs, mostly food costs\n\nCase 15: Great Burger (McKinsey)\nExhibit #2\n(to be handed to the candidate)\nExhibit #2\nSales and Profitability per store\nUnits of GB sold per store 300,000\nSales price per unit $3\nMargin 50%\nUnits of HD sold in GB stores 50,000\nSales price per unit $2\nMargin 60%\nCannibalization Rate of HD products to GB products 10%",

You don’t have to\nknow the exact population of Canada, but you should at least be able to get in the ball park.\nNumbers that occur commonly in cases such as the population of the U.S. you should memorize.\nAdditionally, use numbers that work with the math you are planning to perform. For example, if\nyou are estimating the population of the U.S. and you have to divide by 4, use 280 MM rather\nthan 300 MM.\nDoing math quickly in your head can impress interviewers and make you sound more confident.\nAdditionally, we would recommend you develop a system to keep track of zeroes while you are\ndoing your calculations. You don’t want to get tripped up because you get 1 million instead of\n10 million!\nLastly, get in the habit of taking second to think before you speak. It is better to take an extra\nfew second and be right than to blurt out the wrong answer. Remember, the interviewer is\nevaluating whether they would be comfortable putting you in front of a client!\n\nKey Facts Review\nLocation Population Metric Value\nWorld 7 B Avg.

TCO of EV in 2020 is $92,500 and in 2030 is $85,000.\nThe demand will spike when total cost of owning an EV is less than the total cost of owning an ICE vehicle.\nDoing a quick linear regression, TCO of EV = $90,000 in 2023, and goes further down after that.\nCalculation:\n2020 + ($92,500 - $90,000)/($92,500 - $85,000) * (2030 - 2020)\n 2020 + ($2,500 / $7,500) * 10\n 2020 + 10/3\n 2023\nThis is when demand will spike and is the best time for entry. 2023 is 5 years from current date (2018).\nComparing with maturity curve, we see that 2023 lies in the growth phase and is the best time to enter the market.\nThe TCO – demand correlation curve also supports a high price elasticity, implying that it is best to enter when the price is\nlower and the demand is high.\nPower & Utilities | Market Entry\nInterviewer Guidance for segment / proposition selection\n- Brainstorm with interviewee on next steps -> drive interviewee to think about which\nsegment of the market should Harrison Energy enter.

Ask candidate to brainstorm some of the those costs:\n- Good answers include: Salaries/Labor, Marketing, Rent, Energy, Maintenance, Insurance, etc.\n- Provide the candidates total costs needed for a year : $3M\n3. Good candidates would proceed to calculating margin / net income (if not, guide them to this):\n- Revenues – Costs = $14M - $3M = $11M Net Income\n4. Good candidates would consider time value of money, since this margin would be earned 7 years later\n- Rule of 72 discounting: 72/rate of return (10%) = ~7 years to double money or NPV is half\n- Therefore, net income in today’s value = $11M/2 = $5.5M\n- If candidates are unaware to consider discounting or how to discount – do prompt and guide\n5.

If not, guide them there. Show\nExhibit 1 and explain, “We do not know revenues for Theaters A and B for certain but 6PAQ obtained this\nexhibit. What does it tell you?”\nKey insights:\n1) Revenue has been consistent for both Theaters and they have similar net profits\n2) Theater A has much higher revenue\n3) Theater A’s costs are much higher as a percentage of revenue, indicating its cost structure could be improved\nOnce the candidate nails these insights, indicate, “6PAQ plans to send the same analyst to each theater for a\nmonth to estimate the number of yearly visitors and revenue. Neither theater offers demographic discounts\n(e.g. senior discounts) and the analyst cannot sit at the front of the theaters and count customers or be in\nmultiple places at once.

Specifically, it will install arcades in both theaters, nicer seats, a new\nmobile app for ticket purchasing, and an HVAC system for Theater A which will drive down heating and AC\ncosts. It will cost $4m upfront. After completion one year after development begins, both theaters will\ngenerate an additional 50% revenue (in part due to monopoly pricing and improved theater quality), and\nTheater A’s costs will decrease to what Theater B’s are (due to increased buying power and lower HVAC\ncosts) as a percentage. The theaters will continue to operate as they originally did during the year until\ncompletion. Discount rates and opportunity costs should be ignored. Should the firm undergo this project,\nconsistent with their firm investment criteria?\nNote: This is an ROI calculation (see Calculations – ROI modernization project pg. 91)\nA good candidate will realize that during the first year, nothing will change about either theater while improvements are\nmade, so they should consider the investment only for its Net Profit in Years 2-5. A good candidate would also realize that\nas revenues have doubled, costs have gone down, and the increase in multiple means that they will certainly be able to sell\nfor a 100% ROI.\nAsk the candidate to calculate whether the overall investment would clear the firm’s 100% ROI hurdle, if the\npurchase price multiple was 5x Net Income and the exit price multiple is 6x.

It is as follows:\nDistance Profit-making Loss-making Stores\nStores\n< 0.5 mile 200 100\n0.5 – 2 miles 80 60\n> 2 miles 70 40\nWhich of these stores do you recommend that our client close? What do you recommend for\nthe rest of the stores?\nRetail| M&A\nQuestion 2: Interviewer Guidance\nIn retail, a key success factor is retail presence (‘footprint’). Sometimes, to achieve a footprint on\nscale, some loss-making locations also have to be retained.\nTo answer this question (next slide):\n- All loss making stores which are <0.5 miles from another store should be closed.\n- For all loss making stores which are 0.5 – 2 miles from another store:\n- Customers should be surveyed – is brand stickiness enough to make them travel 2 miles\nif the current store closes\n- Can these stores be turned profitable with short to mid-term transformation measures\n- For all loss making stores >2 miles, the company should invest in long term profitability\ntransformation measures\nRetail| M&A\nQuestion 3\n1. What are key questions that the market regulator can raise?\n2. How will you ensure that the deal and the combined entity adhere to legal requirements?\nRetail| M&A\nQuestion 3: Interviewer Guidance\nAn important factor in understanding regulatory market share concerns in an acquisition is to\nunderstand the type of purchase:\n- Stock purchase: the target company’s stock (complete or partial) is bought from its current\nshareholders. All vendor, customer and employee contracts typically continue, and all assets\nand liabilities transfer to the acquiring entity.\nA stock purchase would typically be more complicated. In this case, the acquiring company will\nhave to commit to divesting/selling parts of the combined business after the deal to bring it\nbelow the market regulator (FTC)’s defined levels. In this case, Mallgreens can decide to sell its\nphotography and convenience store business after the acquisition.\n- Asset purchase: only selected assets (retail locations, manufacturing/warehousing facilities\netc.) are purchased. Contracts and liabilities do not transfer.\nIn an asset purchase, the acquiring company can choose to buy only selected assets from the\ntarget. In this case, Mallgreens can buy only selected BrightAid stores and remain within FTC’s\nthreshold.\nRetail| M&A\nRecommendations Risks Next Steps\nRecommendation: Risks include: Mega Pharma should:\nMallgreens should acquire 1. Potential concerns from 1. Start integration planning –\nBrightAid and: Market Regulators on market systems, procurement,\nshare of combined entity distribution being the focus\n- Close 100 loss-making stores\nareas\nwithin 0.5 miles of other 2. Competitor and Supplier\n2. Define communication plan\nMalgreens stores response\nfor customers and employees\n- Survey customers of 60 loss\nmaking stores within 0.5 - 2\nmiles of other Malgreens\nstores\n- Invest in long-term\nprofitability of 40 loss-making\nstores more than 2 miles of\nother Malgreens stores",

With many new entrants in the healthcare industry, the\ncompany is evaluating ways to both improve the customer experience and invest in the future.\nIn one initiative related to this, PharmaDeliver is exploring the use of drone delivery for its’\ncustomers. The company has hired us to evaluate the potential use of drone delivery.\nInformation provided upon request:\n- They distribute a wide variety drugs directly to customers through both retail and home\ndelivery channels. 80% of non-controlled prescription substances are delivered via home\ndelivery\n- The company only operates in the US\n- The company wants to increase their deliveries by at least 15% and have total profits of at\nleast $7B per year by using drones.\n- The company wants this increase in the first year\nConcepts Tested Brainstorming, Structuring, Quant\nPharma| Growth Strategy\nFramework\nA good framework will include an analysis of the pharmacy market (including competitive\ntrends, future technological advances, etc.), a breakout of how they will both increase deliveries\nand hit $7B in total profit internally, and a consideration of mode of entry for using drones\n(merger, acquisition, partnership).

Calculate the number of home deliveries per year: (Total Medications – Prescription Controlled\nSubstances)* % Home Delivery of Non-Prescription Controlled Substance Medications = (2600 –\n350)*.8 = 1.8B\n2. Calculate the weekly number of deliveries assuming 50 weeks per year. 1.8B/50 = 36M\n3. Calculate the number of deliveries for each of the days of the week.\n- M-F Deliveries % * total =90% * 36M = 32.4M; Deliveries / # days = 32.4M/5 = 6.48M\n- Sat Deliveries % * total = 10% * 36M = 3.6M\n4. Find the difference for both M-F and the weekend between current and new. For M-F, multiply it by 5\nand then by 50 to find the increased annual deliveries. M-F: 8M-6.48M = 1.52M * 5 * 50 = 380M; S/S\n= 10-3.6 = 6.4 * 50 = 320M. Finally, take 320M+380M = 700M and confirm that this is 15% higher\nthan the number of deliveries currently (1.8B * 1.15 = 2.07B).

NLG is planning to launch its first game –an online, multiplayer role playing game that is\nunlike any existing franchise. Being a new player in the industry, NLG’s CEO, Bobby Beck, has asked for your\nhelp in deciding its business model. The company is considering 3 alternatives: a subscription model where\nplayers pay a monthly fee; a retail model where players pay full price at initial purchase, and a free-to-play\nmodel where the game is free to play but charges players for in-game merchandise. How would you advise NLG\nto proceed?\nCase Overview: Overview Information for Interviewer:\nIndustry: Technology - The case will test the candidate on 3 concepts:\no Market sizing. The case starts by asking the candidate to\nCase Type: Product Pricing estimate addressable market size in # of players\no Profitability calculations.

Good answers may vary based as there a several ways to approach the\naddressable market size. If candidate estimates a market size that is significantly different from 10M,\ngently guide candidate to pressure test assumptions\n\nThe Pricing Games: Profitability\nQuestion #2: Profitability Calculations\n- What is NLG’s expected first year profitability with each of the 3 pricing models?\n- Show candidate exhibits 1 and 2\nMath Solution: Math Information:\nRevenues: - All information required\nSubscription: 10M * 10% * $10/mon * 12mon/yr= $120 M for calculations can be\nRetail: 10M * 12% * $60 = $72 M found on Exhibits 1 & 2\nFree-To-Play: 10M * 50% * 30% * $100 = $150 M\n- Guide the candidate\ntowards the footnote in\nCosts:\nExhibit 2 if he/she misses\nSubscription: 10M * 10% * ($50 + $35) + $5M + $10M = $100 M\nit as it contains critical\nRetail: 10M * 12% * ($22 + $18) + $5M + $10M = $63 M information\nFree-To-Play: 10M * 50% * ($13 + $7) + 10M * 50% * 30% * $10 + 5M\n+ 10M = $130M - Interviewee should note\nthat the absolute profit\nProfits (Margin): amounts for subscription\nand free-to-play are\nSubscription: $120 M -$100 M = $20 M (16.67%)\nidentical\nRetail: $72 M -$63 M = $9.0 M (12.50%)\nFree-To-Play: $150 M -$130 M = $20 M (13.33%)\n- Strong candidates will\ncalculate profit margins\n\nThe Pricing Games: Brainstorm\nQuestion #3: Qualitative Brainstorm\n- What non-financial factors would you consider in the subscription vs. free-to-play business models?\nNotes to Interviewer:\n- A strong candidate should display an organized structure while brainstorming. For example, grouping\nthoughts into mutually-exclusive buckets is a recommended practice. A strong candidate should\nmention, among other considerations:\no Competitive response:what if a new competitor launches a game in the same genre? How\nsticky is NLG’s player base when faced with competition?\no Growth potential: is there an opportunity for NLG to expand its product offering to attract more\nplayers? Potential paths for growth include:\n- New platform: expanding from PC to mobile or console\n- New geography: expanding outside of US\n- New game: launching 2ndgeneration game to create new content for players\no Alternate revenue streams: can NLG explore alternate revenue streams such as\nmerchandising? Can NLG participate in E-sports tournaments (contingent on reaching a large\nenough player base)\no Consumer preference changes: will more players migrate to non-PC platforms such as mobile?\nWill a new generation of players lose interest in our game genre?\n\nThe Pricing Games: Chart Interpretation\nQuestion #4: Qualitative Brainstorm\nHow does this information impact your outlook on the 3 different business models? [Show Exhibit 3].\nAfter the candidate has processed the chart, push for a final recommendation.\nNotes to Interviewer:\n- Exhibit 3 contains qualitative information that candidates can use to guide their final recommendation.\n- If the interviewee is unfamiliar with “Beta tests” in the video games industry, inform them that it is part of NLG’s\nmarket research to offer early trial experience to a select group of players\n- Interviewee should realize that a higher value is not favorable for the last survey question\n- Interviewee should note that the retail model would have low customer loyalty and low potential for additional\nrevenue. The free-to-play and subscription responses indicate high levels of customer loyalty.\n- A strong interviewee would comment on the statistical relevance of the survey as it has 100 responses, a statistically\nsignificant amount\n\nThe Pricing Games: Recommendation\nRecommendation, Risks & Next Steps\n- NLG’s CEO, Bobby Beck, wants to meet for lunch to discuss your findings. How would you summarize\nyour recommendation?\nRecommendation:\n- The candidate may recommend either the subscription or the free-to-play business model. A strong\ncandidate will display consistency based on his or her brainstorm from Q3 and cite relevant insights to\nsupport the recommendation, along with mentioning profit margins (if calculated) A strong candidate\nshould also recognize short and intermediate-term risks and suggest tangible methods for mitigation.\n- An example recommendation:\no “I recommend for NLG to pursue the free-to-play business model. This model captures the largest\nplayer base which puts NLG in a strong position against competitive threats. It also allows\nNLG to launch future games, expand to new geographies, or move into other platforms such\nas console or mobile. Even though short-term financial benefits are equivalent to that of\nsubscription, the free-to-play model puts NLG in a more competitive position long-term.”\no “Key risks associated with free-to-play model is generating a sufficient percent of paying players\nand growing revenue per player. To mitigate this risk, I recommend designing two types of in-\ngame purchases. Players can either pay to “beautify” in-game characters to improve aesthetic\nappeal; or, players can pay to expedite the levelling journey and save time from “grinding”\nthrough stages. These efforts will help NLG capture a sufficient segment of paying customers\nbased on two sustainable value propositions.”\n\nThe Pricing Games: Exhibit 1\nPredicted Revenues\nSubscription Retail Free-To-Play*\nTarget Audience 10M 10M 10M\nPredicted Market Share 10% 12% 50%\n% Buy In-Game Content - - 30%\nMonthly Subscription Fees $10 - -\nRetail Price - $60 -\nAnnual In-Game Purchases - - $100\n\nThe Pricing Games: Exhibit 2\nCost Structure\nSubscription Retail Free-To-Play*\nAnnual Variable Cost $50 $22 $13\nCustomer Acquisition Cost $35 $18 $7\nAnnual Product Dev $5 M\nServer Costs $7 M\nOther Fixed Costs $3 M\n*\nPer customer costs in the table are for all customers, including non-paying customers.\nPaying customers incur an additional average variable cost of $10\n\nThe Pricing Games: Exhibit 3\nSurvey Info From Beta Test (n=100)\n)y 5 4.8\nle\nk\nil\nts\na\n4.5 4.2\n4.1\n4.2\ne l\n=\n3.6,y 3.5\nle\nk\nil\nts\no\nm\n=\n2.5 2.3\n5 ( e 2 1.8 1.9\ns n 1.5\no\np 1.5 1.2 1.2\ns\ne\nR\ny 1\ne\nv\nru\n0.5\nS\nContinue playing this Purchase add-ons to Recommend to Switch to a new game\ngame after first year? the base game? friends? in the same genre?\nSubscription Upfront Purchase Free to Play",

Your analyst pulled these benchmarks on what two competitors are\ndoing today. What are your thoughts on these two models? [Give Exhibit 1]\nNotes to Interviewer:\n- Candidate should recognize that these are not the only two possible models, and good candidates will consider other\npossible structures. Further, candidates should not limit themselves to discussing only the elements listed in the exhibit\n-strong candidates will consider other critical features of the model (see examples below)\n- A simple way to assess these models is to discuss the pros and cons of each:\n- Competitor 1’s Model\n- Pros: less operational burden on airline, potential for customer experience continuity (e.g., allow\nsubscriptions across airline carriers), limited costs\n- Cons: limited control over pricing (high price could drive low take rates and anger customers),\nbrand fit considerations\n- Competitor 2’s Model\n- Pros: control over pricing, control over user experience, potential for better ROI, easier to integrate\nwith airline’s other products (e.g., in-flight entertainment system)\n- Cons: more operational burden on airline, higher costs\n- Other considerations: who will pay for the initial investment, what is the ongoing cost structure, potential\nto adopt more than one model across the fleet, technology limitations (vendors don’t come equal)\n\nInterviewer Guide to Exhibit 1\nNotes to Interviewer:\n- Clarifications (if candidate asks):\n- Assume 1 session buys a passenger WiFiconnectivity for the duration of the flight\n- The Exhibit is intentionally missing critical information (e.g., cost structure, technology, product\nfeatures, interoperability with in-flight entertainment system).

They are then\nlayered. Finally, they are cut to specification for the customers –this process is called “sheeting”\n- The client has a range of products that is broadly the same for all customers and that it does not wish to\nchange\n- Margins are acceptable, but management is averse to price-cutting because of a fear of initiating a war with\ncompetitors that would leave everyone worse off\n- Unit price differs according to customer segment (given in next section)\nMarket/Customers\n- PaperCosells to 24,000 commercial printers in the US (20,000 are small, 3,000 medium and 1,000 large)\n- The company has 30% market share in the small printer segment and 10% in the medium and large printer\nsegments\n- Your team-mates recently completed a study that showed that if PaperCoexpanded production it could\nincrease sales to the medium-sized or large-sized printer segments by 20% (Note to interviewer: The\ncandidate should be clear about the difference between increasing sales by 20% and increasing market\nshare by 20 percentage points. The former is correct. The latter would constitute a 200% increase in sales)\n- Printers (the customers) prefer to receive the product in different forms according to the size of the customer:\n- Small prefer boxes\n- Medium prefer cartons\n- Large prefer pallets\n\nA Sticky Paper Situation: Case Guide (2/3)\nClarifying Information:\nMarket/Customers (cont.)\n- Client’s current sales volumes to each customer segment are below:\nVariables Small Medium Large\nNumber of customers 20,000 3,000 1,000\nAnnual unit usage per customer 100 500 3,000\n- The company has the capability to expand production\n- Any additional production would require an increase in the client’s fixed costs (e.g. new packaging\nequipment, expanded facilities, increase in permanent labor force). The amount of the increase differs\naccording to distributionmethod:\n- An expansion in carton distribution capacity would constitute a one-off cost of $675K (for medium\nprinter segment)\n- An expansion in pallet distribution capacity would constitute a one-off cost of $1.3M (for large printer\nsegment)\n- Variable costs consist of materials, sheeting, coating and packaging.\n\nA Sticky Paper Situation: Case Guide (3/3)\nClarifying Information:\nMarket/Customers (cont.)\n- Unit costs differ according to customer segment (given below):\nVariables Small Medium Large\nUnitprice $20 $18 $15\nMaterials cost $5.5 $5.5 $5.5\nCoating cost $1 $1 $1\nSheeting cost $0.5 $0.5 $0.5\nPackaging cost $3 $2 $1\nIndustry\n- This is a mature industry, with low growth across the board\n- There are no significant competitive or regulatory trends in the industry to be aware of\n\nA Sticky Paper Situation: Calculations\nProfitability Calculations:\n- The case requires the candidate to choose the best investment.

  "Stern_2018_Great Burger (McKinsey)": "Great Burger (McKinsey)\nCase Style: Interviewer Led Difficulty: Hard\nCase Prompt:\nLet’s assume our client is Great Burger (GB) a fast food chain that competes head–to-head with\nMcDonald’s, Wendy’s, Burger King, KFC, etc. GB is the fourth largest fast food chain worldwide,\nmeasured by the number of stores in operation. As most of its competitors do, GB offers food and\n“combos” for the three largest meal occasions: breakfast, lunch and dinner. Even though GB owns\nsome of its stores, it operates under the franchising business model with 85% of its stores owned by\nfranchisees (individuals own & manage stores and pay a franchise fee to GB, but major business\ndecisions e.g. menu, look of store, are controlled by GB).\nAs part of its growth strategy GB has analyzed some potential acquisition targets including\nHeavenly Donuts (HD), a growing doughnut producer with both a US and international store\npresence. HD operates under the franchising business model too, though a little bit differently than\nGB. While GB franchises restaurants, HD franchises areas or regions in which the franchisee is\nrequired to open a certain number of stores.\nGB’s CEO has hired McKinsey to advise him on whether they should acquire HD or not.\nCase Overview:\nIndustry: Fast Food Case Type: M&A Concepts Tested:\n- Profitability\n\nGreat Burger: Question 1 (1/2)\nQuestion #1:\nWhat areas would you want to explore to determine whether GB should acquire HD?\nNotes to Interviewer:\nStand Alone Value of HD\n- Growth in market for doughnuts\n- HD’s past and projected future sales growth (break down into growth in number of stores, and growth in\nsame store sales)\n- Competition –are there any other major national chains that are doing better than HD in terms of\ngrowth/profit. What does this imply for future growth?\n- Profitability/profit margin\n- Capital required to fund growth (capital investment to open new stores, working capital)\nManagement Team/Cultural Fit\n- Capabilities/skills of top, middle management\n- Cultural fit, if very different, what % of key management would likely be able to adjust\n\nGreat Burger: Question 1 (2/2)\nQuestion #1:\nWhat areas would you want to explore to determine whether GB should acquire HD?\nNotes to Interviewer:\nSynergies/Strategic Fit\n- Brand quality similar? Would they enhance or detract from each other if marketed side by side?\n- How much overlap of customer base? (very little overlap might cause concern that brands are not\ncompatible, too much might imply little room to expand sales by cross-marketing)\n- Synergies (Note to interviewer: do not let candidate dive deep on this, as it will be covered later)\n- GB experience with mergers in past/experience in integrating companies\n- Franchise structure differences. Detail “dive\" into franchising structures. Would these different structures\naffect the deal? Can we manage two different franchising structures at the same time?\n\nGreat Burger: Question 2\nQuestion #2:\nThe team started thinking about potential synergies that could be achieved by acquiring HD. Here are\nsome key facts on GB and HD. (Note to interviewer: show candidate Exhibit #1)\nWhat potential synergies can you think of between GB and HD?\nNotes to Interviewer:\nLower Costs\n- Biggest opportunity likely in corporate SG&A by integrating corporate management\n- May be some opportunity to lower food costs with larger purchasing volume on similar food items (e.g.,\nbeverages, deep frying oil), however overlaps may be low as ingredients are very different\n- GB appears to have an advantage in property and equipment costs which might be leverage-able to HD\n(e.g., superior skills in lease negotiation)\nIncrease Revenues\n- Sell doughnuts in GB stores, or some selected GB products in HD stores\n- GB has much greater international presence thus likely has knowledge/skills to enable HD to expand\noutside of North America\n- GB may have superior skills in identifying attractive locations for stores as its sales/store are higher than\nindustry average, where as HD’s is lower than industry average –might be able to leverage this when\nopening new HD stores to increase HD average sales/store\n- Expand HD faster then it could do on own –GB as a larger company with lower debt may have better\naccess to capital\n\nGreat Burger: Question 3\nQuestion #3:\nThe team thinks that with synergies, it should be possible to double HD’s US market share in the next 5 years, and that GB’s\naccess to capital will allow it to expand number HD of stores by 2.5 times. What sales/store will HD require in 5 years in order for\nGB to achieve these goals? You should assume:\n- Doughnut consumption/capita in the US is $10/year today, and is projected to grow to $20/year in 5 years\n- For ease of calculation, assume US population is 300 M\n- Use any data from Exhibit #1 you need\nNotes to Interviewer: Note to interviewer -an\noptional probing\nVariable Source(given in case unless stated) Value\nquestion is to ask:\nHD sales Exhibit 1 $700M - Does this seem\nreasonable?\nUS market (Consumptionper capita) x (population) $3B\nHD market share (HD sales) / (US market) 23% A good response would\nNote to interviewer: At this stage, tell the candidate to round to 25% for the sake of simplicity be:\n- Yes, given it implies\n(Projected consumption per capita) x\nUS market in 5 years $6B less than double\nconsumption is predicted to double (population)\nsame store sales\nHD sales in 5 years if double (Currentshare, calculated as 25%) x (double) x $3B growth and per\nmarket share (US market in 5 years)\ncapita consumption\n#of stores in 5 years (Current# stores from Exhibit 1) x (2.5) 2,500 is predicted to\ndouble\nSales/store in 5 years (HD sales in 5 years) / (new number of stores) $1.2M\n\nGreat Burger: Question 4 (1/2)\nQuestion #4:\nOne of the synergies that the team thinks might have a big potential is the idea of increasing the\nbusinesses’ overall profitability by selling doughnuts in GB stores. How would you assess the profitability\nimpact of this synergy?\nNotes to Interviewer:\nBasic Profitability Analysis\n- Calculate incremental revenues by selling doughnuts in GB stores (calculate how many doughnuts per\nstore, time s price per doughnut, times number of GB stores)\n- Calculate incremental costs by selling doughnuts in GB stores (costs of production, incremental number of\nemployees, employee training, software changes, incremental marketing and advertising, incremental cost\nof distribution if we can not produce doughnuts in house, etc.)\n- Calculate incremental investments. Do we need more space in each store if we think we are going to attract\nnew customers? Do we need to invest in store layout to have in house doughnut production?\n- Other reasonable answers are acceptable\n\nGreat Burger: Question 4 (2/2)\nQuestion #4:\nOne of the synergies that the team thinks might have a big potential is the idea of increasing the\nbusinesses’ overall profitability by selling doughnuts in GB stores. How would you assess the profitability\nimpact of this synergy?\nNotes to Interviewer:\nCannibalization\n- If the candidate dives deep in the incremental revenue piece by taking into account cannibalization, what\nwould be the rate of cannibalization with GB offerings? Doughnut cannibalization will be higher with\nbreakfast products than lunch and dinner products, etc.\n- One way to calculate this cannibalization is to look at historic cannibalization rates with new product/offering\nlaunchings within GB stores\n- Might also cannibalize other HD stores if they are nearby GB stores –could estimate this impact by seeing\nhistorical change in HD’s sales when competitor doughnut store opens near by\n- Other reasonable approaches to calculating cannibalization are acceptable\n\nGreat Burger: Question 5\nQuestion #5:\nWhat would be the incremental profit per store if we think we are going to sell 50 thousand doughnuts\nper store at a price of $2 per doughnut at a 60% margin with a cannibalization rate of 10% of GB’s\nsales?\nShow candidate Exhibit #2. Also, if necessary, explain the “Cannibalization Rate” to the candidate.\nNotes to Interviewer:\n- Only do this question if you feel you did not get a good read with the first quantitative question, or if you\nhave ample time left for the case. If you skip this question, tell the candidate the following: The team has\ncalculated that the incremental profit per GB store from selling HD doughnuts would be $15K.\n- Incremental Profit =\n= contribution from HD sales less contribution lost due to cannibalized GB sales\n= 50K units x $2/unit x 60% margin –300K units x 10% cannibalization x $3/unit x 50% margin\n= $60K –45K\n= 5K incremental profit/store\n\nGreat Burger: Question 6\nQuestion #6 (synthesis):\nYou run into the CEO of GB in the hall. He asks you to summarize McKinsey’s perspective so far on\nwhether GB should acquire HD. Pretend I am the CEO -What would you say?\nNotes to Interviewer:\nThis is an example response. Good answers may vary, depending on answers candidate gave in questions 1-4, and\nwhether or not they completed all previous questions.\nEarly findings lead us to believe acquiring HD would create significant value for GB, and that GB should\nacquire HD\n- We believe it is possible to add$15k in profit/GB store by selling HD in GB stores. This could mean\n$50 million in incremental profit for North American stores (where immediate synergies are most likely\ngiven HD has little brand presence in rest of world.\n- We also believe there are other potential revenue and cost synergies that the team still needs to\nquantify\nOnce the team has quantified the incremental revenues, cost savings, and investments, we will make a\nrecommendation on the price you should be willing to pay\nWe will also give you recommendations on what it will take to integrate the two companies in order to capture\nthe potential revenue and cost savings, and also to manage the different franchise structures and potentially\ndifferent cultures of GB and HD\n\nGreat Burger: Exhibit 1\nFinancials GB HD\nTotal store sales $5,500M $700M\nStores GB HD Parent company revenues $1,900M $200M\nKey expenses (% sales)\nTotal 5,000 1,020\n– Cost of sales * 51% 40%\n- North America 3,500 1,000 – Restaurant operating\n24% 26%\ncosts\n- Europe 1,000 20\n– Restaurant property &\n4.6% 8.5%\n- Asia 400 0 equipment costs\n- Other 100 0 – Corporate general &\n8% 15%\nadministrative costs\nAnnual Growth in\n10% 15% Profit as % of sales 6.3% 4.9%\nStores\nSales/store $1.1M $0.7M\nIndustry average $0.9M $0.8M\n* Variable costs, mostly food costs\n\nGreat Burger: Exhibit 2\nSales and Profitability per store\nUnits of GB sold per store 300,000\nSales price per unit $3\nMargin 50%\nUnits of HD sold in GB stores 50,000\nSales price per unit $2\nMargin 60%\nCannibalization Rate of HD products to GB products 10%\n\nAdditional Casing Resources\nResource Uses Cost\n- Additionalcase access\nManagement - Most resources free\n- Firmoverviews, skill practice\nConsulted through MCA subscription\n- 1-on-1 casing ($)\n- $49 (signupwith Stern\nFastMath - Mentalmath tutorials and practice through email address)\nS&P Industry - Free through Stern\n- Industry insightsincluding margins, growth and drivers\nReports Dashboard\n- Framework drills\n- $35per month or\nRocket Blocks - Charts and data analysis skill work\n- $155 per year\n- Mental math practice\n- Various resources includingfast math and framework practice\n- Resources rangefrom\nCase Interview to resume and cover letter coaching\nFree -$X00\nSecrets - Look Over My Shoulder program is a collection of audio files\nof example live-cases, both good and bad\nOther resources: https://nyustern.campusgroups.com/mca/links/",

Costs are $5/switch.\n- There is only one competitor in the market, which has 60% market share.\n- The competitor sells its switch for $15/switch.\n- There is no real difference between the switches the client makes and those made by its\ncompetitor, nor are there significant differences in delivery times, etc.\n- The market share has been divided in this way for years and there hasn’t been a change\nin prices for a long time (other than inflation). Therefore, the two companies in this\nmarket have established excellent relationships with their customers.\n- New customers are not expected to be added in the foreseeable future.\nSwitching Costs (continued)\nRecommended Solution\nQuestion 1 Details\n- Customer acquisition would be very expensive with very low chances of success.\no Customer relationships are a significant “barrier to entry” for market share\ngains/losses.\no Customers that are satisfiedwith the competitor’s quality are unlikely to\nmigrate to the Client just to save a few dollars/switch, given the price of\nmachines and impact of faulty switches.\n- The company has room to raise prices.\no The switches are a very marginal component of the customers’ cost. The\ncustomers will likely not take chances with the quality of switches and\ntherefore are willing to pay a premium.\no Since price does not dictate market share, the client should take advantage of its\n“secured” market share and increase prices.\no The new price could be a range. Push for the interviewee’s rationale behind\npricing.\ne.g. less than $15 might allow client to still claim to customers to be\ncheaper than competition, strengthening relations.\n$15 could be passed off as price parity\nGreater than $15 is possible is customers are truly price inelastic.\nFollow-up questions might be: what do you expect the competition to do.\nHow high are you willing to risk going? What would happen if a low cost\ncompetitor came in at $6?\nOverall Recommendations\nA good answer includes:\n- The interviewee understands the insignificance of the product cost to the customers.\n- After some guidance, the interviewee understands that the company could use the\nmarket’s unique characteristics to raise prices.\nA better answer includes:\n- The interviewee understands that the relationships and trust are a “barrier to entry”.\n- The interviewee recommends raising the price.\nA superior answer includes:\n- The interviewee understands that this company has very strong supplier power.\n- The interviewee recommends increasing the price and provides a clear rationale for\nhow the company could/should position potential prices.",

The\nvaccine needs to pass three phases of testing to be approved by the FDA. It has just completed the\nsecond phase and the client is asking your help to decide if they should fund the third phase. The\nthird phase would last 2 years, cost $300M, and results from previous phases indicate the vaccine\nhas a 95% chance of approval. We would be able to startproducing vaccine immediately\nfollowing approval.\nQuestion 1:Go/No go?\nChicken Pox (continued)\nCase Details\nPart 1: Market Size\nInfo to be given as case progresses:\n- We are only worried about US market in this case.\nInfo to be given if asked:\n- Vaccine is a one time pill\n- Assume US population is 300M and uniformly distributed from 0-75 (as many people\nenter population as leave every year)\n- When asked what portion of population would need vaccine hand them Exhibit #1\n- It is estimated that it would take 3 years to vaccinate existing population\n- When asked about price have them estimate off of Exhibit #2\n- Costs (per pill)\no Distribution $1.50\no Production $2.50\no SG&A $5.00\no Assume the $300M costs for phase three include everything else (plant set up\ncosts…) and can be spread over the 2 years of testing\nExhibits\n- #1 Cumulative distribution of exposure\n- #2 Willingnessto pay\nPart 2: Competitive Landscape\nInfo to be given as case progresses:\n- None\nInfo to be given if asked:\n- Vaccine will not be patented\n- Other companies would have to undergo same series of testing\n- No other companies have started formal testing of vaccine\n- Phase 1 and 2 combined take 3 years (we have 3 years of competitive protection)\n- Phase 1 and 2 cost $200M\nExhibits\n- None\nChicken Pox (continued)\nRecommended Solution\nPart 1 Details\n- Population can be viewed in two parts: existing population when vaccine is released\nand people that will be born every year.\no Exhibit 1 should lead interviewee to estimate that half of existing population 0-\n18 will need vaccine\n300M/75 = 4M people of each age. 4M*18/2 = 36M\nAccording to willingness chart 75% willing to purchase so 36M * .75 =\n27M over 3 years\no 4M babies born every year (steady state uniform distribution) and 75% of\nparents willing to purchase: 4M * .75 = 3M\n- Exhibit 2 should lead interviewee to recommend setting price at $30 per pill\no $30 price-$9 costs = $21 profit per pill\nYear 1 2 3 4 5 6 ...After\nExisting Pop Vaccines 9 9 9\nNew baby vaccines 3 3 3 3 3\nTotal 12 12 12 3 3\nRevenue 360 360 360 90 90\nCosts -150 -150 -108 -108 -108 -27 -27\nNet -150 -150 252 252 252 63 63\n(millions)\n- Pharma companies usually have rather high hurdle rates due to the risky nature of their\nbusiness model but any reasonablerate will yield a high positive NPV. Interviewee\nshould also mention the 5% chance of failure and how that could effect the calculation\n(there are a couple correct ways to interpret the effect). They do not need to calculate\nNPV-just recognize high positive value.\nPart 2 Details\n- Since there is a natural three year protection due to required FDA testing other\ncompanies would not be able to capture the “existing population” segment of the\nmarket. Assume they did enter in year 6 we would be sharing only 3M vaccines per year.\nEven assuming they were able to capture a descent portion of the market theywouldn’t\nbe able to cover the upfront testing costs for years.\n- Costs for phase 1 and 2 should not be used when calculating our go/no go since they\nare sunk, but should be taken into consideration when evaluating competitors decision.\n- Competitors do not have much incentive to follow us into this market making our\nposition even better.\nChicken Pox (continued)\nOverall Recommendations\nA good answer includes:\n- Some prompting led to right assumptions. Completed basic calculations. Set up\nNPV and recommended “GO” based on high positive NPV.\nA better answer includes:\n- This is a fairly fact based case and does have a right answer. Interviewee should fully\nunderstand the model they came up with and confidently recommend “Go.”\nDifference between better and superior would be how much theinterviewee led the\ncase, drove to the right conclusions themselves, and drew on all available information\nto form insights and strengthen recommendation.\nA superior answer includes:\n- There are two key insights:\no “Market” segments into existing population and annual babies born\no Competitors have no incentive to enter\nThese insights should be noticed and understood quickly and without prompting when\ninterviewee reaches that portion of case.\n- Assumptions about graphs are made quickly and explained well.\n- Calculations set up clearly and completed quickly.\n- Overall: NPV analysis indicates project is very profitable.

Analysis\nMarket Entry 4 P’s Supply Chain Internal / External\nCompetitive Threat Porter’s 5 Forces Market Sizing Other\nIntroduction\nYou are a scientist. You have just invented the world’s first everlasting light bulb. Fortunately, you\nhave been granted a rock-solid patent for it. The current light bulb industry is a globalmonopoly.\nHow much is it worth?\nNote to Interviewer: This case requires a thorough pre-read by the interviewer in order to\nmake it work.\nEverlasting Light Bulb (continued)\nCase Details\nInfo to be given if asked:\n- Assume that the patent is for eternity.\n- You are valuing the PATENT not an individual everlasting light bulb.\n- This is a domestic light bulb only so has no commercial applications such as offices or\ncars\n- There are 6B people in the world. You can assume that only 4B people have access to\nelectricity.\n- You can assume that there are 8 people on average per household (HH).\n- Conventional light bulbs price: $2. Everlasting light bulbs will be priced at $5.\n- You can assume that conventional bulbs last 2 years.\n- Assume everyone switches to everlasting in year one. The phase of the transition will\nhave little impact on the eternal patent value, right?!\n- Assume a profit margin of 20% on conventional and everlasting bulbs.\n- Can assume a 5% discount rate.\nEverlasting Light Bulb (continued)\nRecommended Solution\nCurrent market sizing\nA good candidate will ask what type of bulb this is as a clarifying question upfront before they\nattempt a framework. They should also ask for the length of the patent. They will discover it is a\ndomestic bulb with an eternal patent.\nA good candidate thensizes the market for domestic light bulbs. A typical way to start is with 6B\npeople in the world, assuming, say, an average HH membership of 8. Assume only 4B people have\nelectricity supplied houses. Therefore there are 500M HH in the world.\nAssume there are 5 rooms in theglobal averageHH (not everyone is a rich American). Therefore\nthere are 2.5B domestic rooms. Assume 2 bulbs on average so 5B domestic bulbs globally. With $2\nper bulb, amateurs then say the industry today is worth $10B pa.But bulbs last for 2 years.Therefore\nthe industry today is worth $5B. This is the “schoolboy” trap in this case. With a 20%margin, current\nprofit is therefore $1B pa.\nWould people switch?\nYes. $2 every two years or $5 one-time is a no-brainer decision for the consumer to make. The\neverlasting bulb will pay for itself in a mere 5 years.\nWhat is the value of the new industry?\nWell, you only buy one everlasting bulb. Therefore 5B bulbs * $5 = $25B. 20% margin so $5Bone-\ntime profit. Another “schoolboy” error is to say $25B sales every year. Remember: it is an\neverlasting bulb.\nEverlasting Light Bulb (continued)\nSo what?\nThe everlasting bulb will destroy an industry pumping out $1B pa profit for the monopoly and\ncause a $5B bonanza for the scientist.\nSo how much is the patent worth? The interviewer should then try to trick the interviewee\nand say its worth $1B pa in profit so at 5% discount rate in perpetuity its worth $20B right?\nIt is surprisingly easy to get them to agree to this. Challenge them as follows.\nBut if it’s worth $5B in a one-off bonanza to the scientist, the monopoly should pay $15B or\nless, right?\nAgain, easy to get them to agree to this new answer. Once they agree with $14.5B you say…\nBut hang on, why not buy it and lock it in a safe? If the patent is bulletproof it’s only worth\n$5B, i.e. the standalone value to the scientist, right? Alternatively, aren’t you a monopoly? So\nyou are the only potential buyer right? An external buyer would only pay $5B (the value of the\nstandalone patent). So why not pay $5B and one cent?\nThey will then agree to this new answer which is 1/3 of the $15B they were proposing a while\nago.\nBut hang on; the scientist is just a scientist. So he has no sales and marketing infrastructure.\nSo its worth less than $5B, right? That just assumed a 20% steady state profit margin but\ns/he has no infrastructure. So assuming $500m sales cost it’s only worth $4.5B, right?\nAgain, easy to get them to agree to this. They will be getting very suspicious of all the pat answersyou\nare giving them but they arenot far off here though.\nSo it’s worth $4.5B and one cent, right?\nAt this point they will feel so confused and stupid that they will be wary of you. A great candidate will\nconfidently state yes but they are typically utterly demoralized at this point. But this is the\n“right” answer.\nNotes\nThey often panic at the start as no real framework exists to answer this bar the simple market\nsizing at the start. It is a great conceptual thinking decision flow-chart what-if style question that\nrewards candidates for confident thinking on their feet. It can be a very hard case.The best\ncandidates remain composed while bombing certain sections. This test of this case is to show\ngrace under fire.",

Analysis\nMarket Entry 4 P’s Supply Chain Internal / External\nCompetitive Threat Porter’s 5 Forces Market Sizing Other\nIntroduction\nOur client, FC Limited (Fine China Limited) manufactures sets of fine china (plates, tea cups,\netc). They only sell the china in sets (never as individual pieces) at $1,500 per set. Excess or lack\nof demand has never been a problem for FC, and they sell 10,000 sets per year. The company\nwas started 50 years ago and has been successful and profitable throughout its history. However,\nin the last 7 years a key competitor recently entered the industry. FC’s recently learned that the\ncompetitor has at least 50% higher margins and would like to match or exceed its results.\nQuestions: (to be asked and answered in order)\nQuestion 1: Why are FC’s profit margins not good as these new entrants? How do you proposeFC\nfix this problem?\nQuestion 2: Given the issues and recommendations from Question 1, how can FC cut costs, andwhat\nare the new expected profit margins?\nFine China (continued)\nCase Details\nQuestion 1: Why are FC’s profit margins not as good as they would expect? How do you\npropose FC fix this problem?\nInfo to be given as case progresses:\n- FC sells 10,000 sets per year. They are exactly meeting demand and this number is not\nexpected to change in the coming years. (Essentially, this is not a revenue generation\nissue)\n- The company has been profitable, but as new entrants have arisen, they noticed that\ntheir margins are not as high as some of these new competitors.\nInfo to be given if asked: (The interviewer should encourage the interviewee once/if he/she goes\ndown the supply chain path)\n- Raw material costs (porcelain clay): in-line or less than that of their competitors.\n- Manufacturing: takes place in FC’s North Carolina headquarters. Manufacturing is\nefficient, and costs are slightly lower than those of their competitors.\n- Distribution: FC has 6 warehouses: 2 in North Carolina, 2 in Ohio, and 2 in Southern\nCalifornia. FC manufactures the china in North Carolina. The sets are then distributed\nto the regional warehouses for quicker shipping to the retailers in those regions when\norders are placed to the factory.\n- The china is only sold as a set. It is the crème-de-la-crème of china; the sales channels\nare upscale retail stores like Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue.\n- These retail stores do not hold inventory of the china; they just have one set for their\ndisplay case because the china is so delicate and susceptible to breakage. The stores do\nnot want the liability of holding inventory. They take orders from customers for next\nday pick-up from the store or occasionally the sales person will make a personal home\ndelivery.\n- Delivery to the store requires “White glove service”. No damage or sloppiness\npermitted. This is the reason for the warehouse network.\n- “Shipping”-when the company started, they used rail-roads to transport the china\nfrom the manufacturing plant to the warehouses. In the last 30 years they moved to\nusing trucks for this transportation.\n- The key competitor is located in Tennessee (if the interviewee pushes, the location is\nin Memphis), has one warehouse and usesFedEx from their manufacturing site to ship\nquickly to retailers, they also have the one day delivery commitment. (Don’t volunteer\nthe competitor’s distribution strategy until the candidate asks about FC’s value chain\ndescription and for comparisonto the competitor.)\n- Retailer to Customer link: customer sees the china in the retailer’s display case and\nplaces an order. The retailer immediately contacts FC to have a set shipped to the store\nfor the customer.\n- Pricing is in-line or slightlyhigher than their competitors, FC’s price will not change\nFine China (continued)\n- Common carrier “white glove service” is more expensive than our current per box\nshipping cost allocation. No need to be precise in how much more expensive. If\npressed, it costs $150 per set.\n- A good proxy for evaluating fixed cost mix is square footage in the facilities. The\nfactory is twice the size of the average warehouse.\nQuestion 2:\nQuestion 2a: What does the current income statement and cost structure look like? (What are the\nprofits and current profit margin?)\nQuestion 2b: Given that FC has decided to eliminate most of the warehouse space, where can FCcut\ncosts and what are the new expected profit margins?\nQuestion 2a: See attached exhibit. This is for the interviewer only. The interviewee should\n“derive” the income statement.\n1. The interviewer should tell the interviewee that current total costs are $12mm\n2. The interviewer should ask the interviewee what he/she thinks are the major cost items.As\nthey are named, the interviewer should reveal the % of total costs.\n3. Once all of the costs have been uncovered, the interviewer should ask the interviewee for\nthe current profit margin. (20%)\nExample dialog:\nInterviewee: There must be high warehousing costs for those 6 warehouses\nInterviewer: Yes. Fixed Overhead is 40%of total costs\nQuestion 2b: Now that we have discovered that profit margins in the existing business are 20%,\nwhere can FC cut costs? What are the new expected profit margins as a result of these reduction\nin cost?\nAgain, see attached exhibit for interviewer only.\n- The interviewee should identify the cost heads that could be reduced.\n- Once identified, the interviewer should tell them the expected percent reduction.\n- After all cost reductions have been identified, the interviewer should ask the interviewee\nfor the new profit margin. (approximately 42%)\nThis part of the case is for cost intuition as well as public math.\nFine China (continued)\nRecommended Solution\nQuestion 1 Details\n- The current distribution system in this era of overnight shipping is inefficient and\ncostly. They should cut out the middle distribution warehouses to reduce costs and\nincrease profits.\n- FC should move to shipping inventory through overnight services like FedEx or UPS.\nThe increased transportation costs are more than offset by the potential cost reductions.\nQuestion 2 Details\n- Fixed overhead, labor and inventory costs will decrease as a result of fewer distribution\nwarehouses. Shipping expenses will increase. See attached exhibit for details and\nnumerical solutions.\nOverall Recommendations\nA superior answer includes:\n- A superior interviewee quickly recognizes that this is not a pure-play profitability case\nbut rather a supply chain case as well. (i.e. the interviewer uses both the profitability\nand supply chain frameworks in some fashion)\n- Uses his/her intuition to quickly spot the crux of the problem: the abundance of\ndistribution warehouses.\n- Can not only calculate the numbers in Q2, but also has a sense for why the numbers\nmake sense.\nFine China (continued)\nEXHIBIT 1\nFINE CHINA, LTD\nCURRENT \"INCOME\" STATEMENT: NEW INCOME STATEMENT\nDERIVED IN QUESTION 2A… TO BE DERIVED IN 2B…\nRevenue(have interviewee\ncalculate) 10,000 sets @ $1,500/set = $ 15,000,000 $ 15,000,000\nExpected % Reduction WHY: (Interviewee should\nCosts:(figures given once % of of $12mm Total Cost (to be given to give intuition behind each\ncost head is named) (to be given to interviewee) interviewee) number) increase/decrease\nstays the same b/c producing the\nsame amount\nRaw materials 20% $ 2,400,000 0% $ 2,400,000 $ -\nReduction of warehouse space\n(keep some in NC)\nFixed Overhead 40% $ 4,800,000 -50% $ 2,400,000 $ (2,400,000)\nFewer laborers loading and\nunloading atwarehouses\nLabor 20% $ 2,400,000 -25% $ 1,800,000 $ (600,000)\nFedEx is more expensive than\ntrucking overall\nShipping 10% $ 1,200,000 25% $ 1,500,000 $ 300,000\nLess inventory in warehouses\nInventory Costs 10% $ 1,200,000 -50% $ 600,000 $ (600,000)\nTotal: GIVEN: $ 12,000,000 $ 8,700,000 $ (3,300,000)\nProfit Margin 20% 42%\nJust need approx….

He was given a $20 million grant to think of a\ncool, yet socially responsible, technology. After some time, he has finally created a product that is on\nthe brink of commercialization. It’s a GPS device that is placed into a car and senses the type\nand severity of a car accident. It immediately transmits this information back to emergency\nservices, which then deploys resources to the accident scene. This service is most valuable for the more\nsevere accidents, otherwise known as “Type A” accidents. At this point, my friend is\nconsidering a pilot in the Chicago area. Before he moves forward, he would like us to help him\nanswer the following questions:\nQuestion 1:How large is this market opportunity?\nQuestion 2: What methods should he use to price the device? (qualitative rather than quantitative\nanswer)\nOnly you can prevent accidents! (continued)\nCase Details\nQuestion 1: How large is this market opportunity?\nInfo to be given if asked:\n- 1 million cars in Chicago\n- 1% of cars get into Type A accidents per year\n- The average Type A accident medical claim is $100,000\n- The new device should save $50,000 per claim\nInfo to be given as case progresses:\n- “Market opportunity”= the size of the potential market\no Market does not equal (# of sales x sale price). It is a measure of the “potential”\nopportunity (read: if the product reached 100% market saturation and extracted\n100% of the value of the product).\no Focus on medical claims only. The interviewer should let the interviewee be\ncreative and suggest other ideas for a bit (i.e. device may result in other savings);\nhowever, suggest that the candidate size the market based on medical claims\n- Hopefully, interviewee keyed in on “Type A accidents” statement in the opening. For\nsimplicity, he/she should focus on Type A accidents.\n- Focus on Chicago market opportunity only.\nQuestion 2: How would you price this device?\nInfo to be given if asked:\n- Fully-loaded device costs $400 (this is not price—but cost of making device)\nInfo to be given as case progresses:\n- Don’t give but rather ask the interviewee to think about the following:\no Who is the customer?\no Who are the stakeholders (who is interested in it):\nEnd user (car driver)\nOther individuals (family, other party in accident, community)\nInsurance companies (primarily health, but also life and P&C)\nGovernment\nOEM’s (i.e. Ford)\nMechanics\nMedical community, including emergency services\nCompetitors\nInvestors\nEtc.\nOnly you can prevent accidents! (continued)\n- Once interviewee has listed them, ask him to think about the impact of some of the\nstakeholders. Examples include:\no Government: makes it mandatory\no OEM’s/mechanics: installing devices in new/used cars o\nCommunity: social mandates\no Investors:need for return\no (Potential) competitors: imitation (is this a defensible patent?)\nOnly you can prevent accidents! (continued)\nRecommended Solution\nQuestion 1 Details\n- Market Opportunity = Device Savings Per Claim * Type A Accidents/Year\no Device Savings Per Claim = ($100,000-$50,000) = $50,000\no Type A Accidents/Year = (1,000,000 * 1%) = 10,000\no Market Opportunity = $50,000 * 10,000 = $500 million\n- A good answer will get to the $500 million number\n- A better answer will get to the $500 million number using a structured framework\n- A superior answer will also talk about one or several of the following:\no New product diffusion curve (the product will be adopted over time)o\nOther values of the device (beyond claims savings)\no Device compatibility: can this device be used in any car?\n- Things to avoid:\no Getting stuck on the definition of “market opportunity”\nQuestion 2 Details\n- A good answer will discuss various aspects of the pricing framework:\no Pricing strategy framework:\n1. Prepare marketing analysis:\na. Customers\ni. Segments\nii. Targeting\niii. Positioning\nb. Competitors/substitutes\n2. Make marketing mix decisions\n3. Estimate demand curve\n4. Calculate cost\n5.

They supply popcorn makers (e.g.Act\nII, Orville Redenbacher’s, etc.) with the grease resistant paper used to package popcorn\nkernels in a variety of serving sizes. In this industry, the quality of the paper is determined by placing a\nbag of freshly micro-waved popcorn on a napkin and measuring the amount of greasethat seeps\nthrough the paper packaging and is absorbed by the napkin.\nThe R&D department of our client recently developed a new type of paper that doubles the\nperformance of the paper. A new type of coating is applied to thepaper that virtually eliminatesany\nseepage of grease in the napkin test.\nQuestion 1:Should our client introduce this new product into the market?\nSnap, Crackle, Pop (continued)\nCase Details\nQuestion 1: Should our client introduce this new product into the market?\nInfo to be given if asked:\n- What is the overall market size?\no Overall volume in the market is 100 million sheets of grease resistant paper\nper year.\n- What is the competition in this market?\no There our 4 players who supply paper in this market.

Will they derive a competitive advantage?\no They have not had direct conversations with the popcorn makers. They did\nhowever run some initial focus groups with end-customers (i.e. buyers of\npopcorn), and found theamount of grease that seeps through paper is not a\nconcern for buyers and introducing the new paper will not necessarily sway\nconsumer’s buying decision.\n- Will producing the new paper require a large capital investment?\no The cost of setting up the new production will be minimal.\n- Will the new paper increase our client’s raw material costs (e.g. thicker paper, more\ncoating, etc)?\no It currently costs our client $0.10 to produce each sheet of paper for an\nindividual package of popcorn. The chemicals in the coating of the new paper\nincrease the cost of a sheet by 20% to $0.12.\n- Will our customer’s clients incur any additional costs to setup their production\nprocess to accommodate the new type of paper?\no They will not incur any extra costs in the production/packaging process. In\nfact, they will actually be able to save some money by using the new paper.\nThe old paper required that popcorn makers to glue two sheets of paper\ntogether before packagingin order to achieve the desired grease resistance.\nThe new paper allows popcorn makers to eliminate this step in the production\nprocess that previously added $0.12 to their total packaging costs.\nTotal Packaging Costs for Popcorn Makers\nOld New\nGrease Resistant Sheets Needed 2 1\nCost per Sheet $0.20 ?\nCost to Glue Sheets $0.12 $0.00\nTotal Packaging Costs $0.52 ?\nSnap, Crackle, Pop (continued)\nRecommended Solution\nQuestion 1 Details\n- Interviewer should identify that talking to your client’s customers (i.e. popcorn\nmakers) would be the first step\n- Realize that increasing the total packaging cost for popcorn makers to utilize the new\npaper in their packaging operations is notan option\n- Realize that introducing the new paper will cut our client’s volume by 50%\n- Come up with a pricing strategy that will allow our client to maintain existing\nprofitability, or potentially increase profitability by reducing total packaging costs for\npopcorn makers and increasing market share.\nOverall Recommendations\nA good answer includes:\n- Identifies that seeking input from your client’s customers is a critical step\n- Recognizes that the new paper adds minimal value to the end customer and thus will\nnot help popcorn makers differentiate themselves\n- Analyzes the supply chain to come to the conclusion that a the new paper will lead to\na 50% drop in volume if our client maintains the same market share\nA better answer includes:\n- Recommends a specific price that our client should set to maintain profitability at\ncurrent volume (i.e. $0.52)\n- Highlights that our client will haveto pre-sell this innovation with clients over time as\nthey will probably not be amenable to what they may perceive as a $0.32 price\nincrease\nA superior answer includes:\n- Recommends a specific price range that will allow the client to increase its market\nshare and profitability by lowering the total packaging cost for popcorn makers in a\nretail market with increasing pricing pressure\n- Identifies additional steps our client will have to take to ensure it can capitalize on\nthis opportunity (e.g. patent protection, sales and marketing, etc.)\n- A superior answer should also quickly realize that the rationale for the product\nintroduction is driven by cost reductions for popcorn makers vs. demand creation inthe\nretail market.",

How do customers view our\nproducts?\nInfo to be given as case progresses:\n- Prompt interviewee if needed: You’d want to know how Splat’s product compares to\ncompetitors in the eyes of customers\nInfo to be given if asked:\nEnd customers: How would we figure out what customers think? Survey people who\nbought paintball guns…prompt for possible survey questions\n- e.g. When you bought the gun, what were the most important criteria?\n- e.g. How did Splat rate relative to other guns you looked at?\n- When surveyed, customers indicated they buy based on reputation for quality, and\nSplat is known as having the best paintball guns on the market. 2 other players are\nviewed quite favorably, but not as highly ranked as Splat.\nSplat! (continued)\nRetail customers - So the market is growing at 20%, and Splat has a slightly better\nproduct than our competitors. What else could lead to 50% Splat growth vs. 20%\nmarket?\n- Brainstorm for interesting ideas\n- Other than the people who purchase the gun, retailers are a key customer\no Sell through paintball specialty stores, large chains of sports stores such as\nGalyans, Sports Authority, & Wal-Mart.\no Splat’s sales have been steady through specialty channel, but growing ~60%\nper year in large chains. What might be going on?\nStores might be growing faster than the stores our competitors are\nselling through\n- No, we surveyed store managers in a bunch of these stores and\nthey consistently said sales were growing at 20%. They sell all\nbrands, and Splat was doing slightly better than others (~25%\ngrowth).\nOur stores may be adding new locations, or Splat has recently been\nadded to some of these stores\n- Yes. Over the last few years, the chains have added Splat to a\nfew stores per year. They are now in almost all of the stores.\nSplat! (continued)\nRecommended Solution\n- The company has been growing fast for a few reasons:\no High market growth\no Quality product\no Adding stores\nAdding stores appears to be done, so growth will only be from market growth\n& share gain vs. competitors, estimated at 25%\n- Depending on the price of the deal, the company should buy Splat if the return meets their\nneeds with the company growing 20-25% per year over the next few years\n- (If time) What risks would you highlight?\no Maybe paintball is a fad, and participation will stop increasing or even decline\no Maybe brand perceptions change quickly, and we will lose share\no Maybe someone will get killed or injured playing paintball. If it’s our gun, it’s a legal\nissue. If it’s another gun, it may result in decreased participation.\nOverall Recommendations\nA good answer includes:\n- Structuring an approach to answering the overarching question (i.e., identifying the\nneed to understand the market, competitors, and customers)\n- Understanding the different components that make up the market sizing\nSplat! (continued)\nA better answer includes:\n- Recognizes that Splat growth is much greater than market growth and quickly trying\nto identify the source of the discrepancy\n- Realizing that roll-out into the retail channel/supply chain could be the current source\nof extraordinary growth for Splat\nA superior answer includes:\n- Move quickly through market sizing, uncover the difference between market and\nSplat growth, and understand the difference between the two\n- Understanding the importance of end consumers and retailers in order to solve case\n- Identifying that there are risks to every investment worth considering",

What is the maximum price your client should\npay?\nInfo to be given as case progresses:\nThecurrentexpected future cashflows for the company are $2 million per yearfor only 10 years\nIf consolidation occurs, cashflows probably would increase due to pricing power\nCurrent price Acme charges is $70 per ton\nProfit margin for Acmeand Cementco is approx. $3 per ton\nAnnual production for Acme and Cementco is approx. 700,000 tons each\nIt is estimated that any synergies / economies of scale would be negligible\nCost of capital is 10%\nCement It (continued)\nCase Details\nPart C:Revaluation\n(Continue with Part C if the interviewee recommends a maximum price around $10–15 million)\nThe client calls the owner of Cementcoand offers $12 million for the company. However the\ncompetitor says that he would not sell the company to your client for less than $24 million. Why is the\nprice so high and should Acme buy Cementco at this price?\nAdditional info to be given as case progresses:\nNone\nCement It (continued)\nRecommended Solution\nPart A Details\nInterviewee will typically explore issues on the cost side, looking for synergies, for example IT, Sales,\nMarketing, Facilities, Trucking fleet, Support staff etc. The interviewershouldexplain why none of\nthese gives much return. (Interviewer will be assessing commercial understanding)\nInterviewee may advise not to buy, based on the lack of synergy, and may advise alternative revenue\ngrowth options, including:\no Expanding into new markets-why do we assume they are attractive?\no Expanding product line-up–but what do we know about adjacent products?\no Compete on service– realistic?\no Changing pricing to drive volume–what happens then?\nInterviewee should recognize that acquisition of the competitor is a good option–especially given the\ncompetitive uncertainty associated with the downside risk of an alternative buyer\nThe interviewee may or may not recognize the potential monopoly play available to Acme.\nParts B Details\nPart B assumes the interviewee to have failed to recognize the monopoly play, but continues to test for\ncomfort with numbers. If the candidate has recognized the monopoly potential, their analysis will\nmost likely combine elements of Parts B & C.\nInterviewee should set up aDCFand estimatean NPV of $10-$15MM. (If interviewee realizesthat\nprices can be increased the NPV will be a lot higher)\nYear 1 2 3 … 9 10\nCashflows ($MM) 2 2 2 … 2 2\nPV Cashflows ($MM) 2x (1.1)1 2x (1.1)2 2x (1.1)3 … 2 x (1.1)9 2x (1.1)10\nNPV ~$12 MM\nRecognize that acquiring the competitor may result in economies of scale (reduced workforce, sharing\nof assets)\nCement It (continued)\nRecommended Solution\nParts C Details\nInterviewee should recognize that if Acme buys Cementco it willbecome a monopoly and prices can be\nincreased\nInterviewee should estimate the effect of a reasonable price increase (e.g. $2 per ton / 3%), similar to the\nanalysis shown below and thus be able to determine that a small price rise could result in the valueof the\nacquisition increasing to $24MM\nAcme Cementco\nCurrent Price $70 $70\nCurrent Margin $3 $3\nΔ Price and Margin $2 $2\nPercentage Δ Price 3% 3%\nTons / Year 700,000 700,000\nΔ Profit / Year $1,400,000 $1,400,000\nTotal Δ Profit / Year $2,800,000\nDiscuss the potential issues surrounding the purchase and analysis:\nPotential regulatory blocking\nHigher prices and margins will encourage new entrants into the market, thus depressing\nprices again\nOverallRecommendations\nA good answer includes:\nReal worldthinking in terms of possibleoperations of a NHcement company (e.g. no large back-office)\nClear understanding of both the cost and revenue options and a quick understanding ofopportunities\nassociated with decreased competition / monopoly\nA better answer includes:\nQuickly sees the commercial opportunities and undertakes DCF andpricing analysis on that basis\nSticks to the advice to buy, even if payingup, to avoid encouraging an alternative player into the market\nA superior answer includes:\nAll of the above, but also pushes the interviewer on Trucking fleet rationalization or some other synergy,\nwhich, although small also drives profitability\nThinks un-prompted of ways to structure the payment to the owners of the other firm so as to share the\nrisks associated with price rises and lowers the overall cost of borrowing.",

(Under by $13M vs. $125 M revenue)\nCASE 1\nImproving Profitability\nNow that we have all of the revenue and costs, let’s work on making the company more\nprofitable. Have the candidate brainstorm and then guide them through the below:\n● Costs\n○ Manufacturing- We are already producing our clothing in the cheapest manner\npossible.\n○ Shipping- We could cut 5% of our COGS by shipping the clothing by boat instead of\nair\n■ Savings: $4.5M annual (90M * 5%)\n○ Labor- We have what we need, cannot reduce\n○ Rent- Have candidate brainstorm how you could potentially reduce the rent burden.\nSome options:\n■ Move location of flagship- No, we need it for marketing\n■ Close mall stores- We are not ready to make that move as we are hoping to\ncontinue expanding in the suburbs in the future\n■ Share the rent with another business- YES! Opening a coffee shop within the\nstore would cut 25% of our debt burden at the flagship store.\n● Savings: $1.75M annual\nCASE 1\nImproving Profitability\n● Revenue\n○ Have candidate brainstorm how we can improve revenue\n■ Train the sales staff better to sell- No, they’re pretty well trained\n■ Lower prices- No, it wouldn’t solve our margin issue\n■ Online store- We are not ready to make that investment at this time\n■ Turns out that American customers don’t love the styles and have some\ntrouble with Asian sizes (the styles tend to be too conservative, the colors are\ntoo muted, our clothing tends to run small for the US market)\n■ Adjusting design and sizes and continuing to manufacture separately for the\nAmerican market will cost us $12M annually, but it will provide $23M\nadditional revenue per year\n● Incremental revenue: $11M annual\n● Total incremental income\n○ $1.75M + $4.5M savings\n○ $11M incremental revenue\n○ Total $17.25M→ makes up for $13M deficit\nCASE 1\nRecommendation\nThe CEO is about to walk in and she would like to hear the candidate’s recommendations- have\nhim/her make some. *Make sure you say she and give the candidate feedback if he/she falls prey\nto bias and calls the CEO a “he”*\nCurrently we are seeing revenues of $125M annually, but costs of $138M, meaning we are $13M\nin the red. However, we have studied the cost and revenue structure of your retail operation and\nfound that there are a few actions you can take at this time. On the cost side, we recommend\nchanging your means of shipping from air to boat, a change we have found will bring $4.5M in\nannual savings. Additionally, we recommend seeking a partner to share your rent/space at the\nflagship store. We believe, for example, that placing a coffee shop within the store would save you\n25% in rent, for a savings of $1.75M annually and perhaps encourage your customers to shop\nmore. Finally, we recommend revamping your inventory for the American market by adjusting\ndesigns and sizes to better meet demand. We estimate this will drive $11M in additional annual\nrevenue. Together, these measures will more than make you profitable, breaking even and making\n$4.25M in profit. Potential risks of this plan include having an unreliable retail partner at the\nflagship store, making products that the American market still doesn’t like, and delaying inventory\nstocking through the new shipping method. For this, we recommend a study into whom the retail\npartner should be, engaging in extensive market research to produce the correct SKUs for the\nmarket, and adjusting US warehouse operations and lead times to ensure that stocking is not\ndelayed.",

Lower quality shoes tend to be manufactured in China, Southeast Asia,\nWhere are high-quality shoes manufactured? and Central America, high quality ones in Eastern Europe.\nCASE 4\nUnit Profitability\nThe client has begun assessing a manufacturer based in Vietnam. They want us to do an in-\ndepth analysis of the per-unit profitability of shoes produced in our existing facility vs. the\nVietnam facility. Assume no capex in either case (U.S. capital is sunk, Vietnam arrangement\nwould be cost plus). What does the equation for per-unit profitability for shoes look like?\nprofit = retail revenue – (COGS + labor + SG&A + transportation + quality + tariffs + retail margin)\nGive the interviewee the below data and have them solve for profitability.\nU.S. Vietnam\nRetail revenue $200 $200\nCOGS 30% 20%\nDirect labor 25% 5%\nSG&A 20% 25%\nTransportation 4% 10%\nQuality 1% defect rate 5% defect rate\nTariffs NA 10%\nRetailmargin 10% 10%\nProfit $10 $15\nCASE 4\nUnit Profitability Conclusion\nGiven estimated profitability at both facilities, what should the client do? What are the key\nconsiderations and sensitivities that this basic model contains?\nBased on the unit-profitability analysis, the client should offshore manufacturing to Vietnam\nbecause it is 50% more profitable on a unit basis to manufacture there. There are several\nconsiderations and sensitivities to keep in mind:\nMaterial costs and labor costs are much lower in Vietnam than in the U.S., driving most of\n•\nthe Vietnam manufacturing cost savings.\nProduction quality is significantly worse in Vietnam (5% vs. 1%), and further quality\n•\ndeterioration would impact profitability and swing the decision to the U.S.\nProducing in Vietnam also entails added transportation and tariff costs, which are vulnerable\n•\nto macroeconomic shifts (increased fuel costs, increased tariffs).\nAre we missing anything else in this analysis that might drive costs higher in the\noffshoring case? Or is it possible that the client should split manufacturing across the two\noptions and, if so, what proportion of shoes should be made in Vietnam vs. the U.S.? Once\nthe interviewee has touched on most the above, introduce this question. Direct the interviewee\nto the opening framework and ask about lead time and the volatility of demand.\nCASE 4\nTotal Landed Cost\nThe client just gave us one piece of information in addition to the costing data.\nShoes manufactured in Vietnam have a lead time of three months (time from order\nto delivery). Shoes manufactured in the U.S., in comparison, have a lead time of\none month. What additional factors should the client add to the unit\nprofitability model in order to make the right sourcing decision? Why are they\nimportant? Wait for the interviewee to touch on the below:\nAverage demand per period\n•\nVolatility / standard deviation of demand per period\n•\nCost of capital / holding cost per period\n•\nThese factors are important because uncertainty of demand combined with a\nlonger lead time implies working capital costs. Vietnam’s lead time is longer than\nthat of the U.S., leading to higher working capital costs and an opportunity to do\ndual sourcing where the client manufactures base demand in Vietnam and excess\ndemand in the U.S.\nCASE 4\nTotal Landed Cost Conclusion\nIn consideration of the importance of demand, volatility, and cost of capital, we’ve\ncome up with the following equation to enable us to calculate the proportion of\nshoes that should be manufactured offshore. Give the interviewee the below\nequation and inputs, you can ask them to recall the Vietnam cost advantage:\nℎ\nOffshored fraction = 1 − 𝛿\n2𝜇∆𝑐\n𝛿 = standard deviation of demand / period = 20\n𝜇 = average demand / period = 1,000\nℎ = holding cost / unit / period = $1\n∆𝑐 = Vietnam cost advantage / unit = $5 (can ask interviewee)\n$1\n80% = 1 − 20\n2∗1000∗5\nTherefore, based on these assumptions, the client should manufacture 80% of its\nshoes in Vietnam and the remaining 20% in the U.S.\nCASE 4\nWrap-up\nWhat should the client do?\nThe client should manufacture 80% of its shoes in Vietnam, and 20% of its shoes\nin the U.S. as a hedge against volatility and keeping in mind the cost of capital.\nThe unit profitability advantage for Vietnam excluding lead time and the cost of\n•\nworking capital is $5 ($15 vs. $10).\nThis cost advantage comes primarily from lower COGS and labor costs, and is\n•\nsomewhat offset by quality, transportation, and tariff costs.\nDemand is not highly volatile, nor is the client’s cost of capital, and as a result,\n•\nwe find that the majority of expected demand can be met by Vietnam capacity.\nAs follow-on steps, the client may wish to understand the sensitivity of these\nassumptions to quality, transportation, and tariff costs, as well as future changes to\nthe volatility of demand for the product. Greater volatility or higher cost of capital\nwill push the client to shift more manufacturing back to the U.S.",

The idea is that in exchange for a lump sum, the city of Chicago would turn over the operation and\nrevenue stream of its ~40,000 parking spaces to a private operator.\nThe deal will bring in a big amount of cash for a cash-strapped city and relieve it of the responsibility of\nmaintaining meters – something it isn’t very good at. The city is planning to use a competitive bidding process\nwith the highest bidder winning the contract. Bidders will be expected to set the prices for their parking meters\nand should be aware that they bear the risk of consumer demand for parking spaces and should factor that in\nwhen pricing their bids. Additionally, the contract also requires a high-tech upgrade replacing the old coin-\nbased meters with new machines that accept cash, credit or debit cards, which is a service enhancement that\nshould be incorporated in the bid.\nYour consulting firm has been hired by the Company Parking GenNext to give a reasonable price for the\nrights to collect all money* from Chicago’s meters over a 20 year timeframe to win the competitive bid.

In the interest of\ntime and if the interviewer so desires, the following information / table can be provided:\nNumber and Price of Meters\nIn Chicago, there are ~40,000 metered spaces. And there is a three-ring structure when setting\nmeter rates in Chicago; information is summarized below:\nRing Description Price per Hour % Meters\nI Downtown Loop 3 3%\nII Central Business District 2 16%\nIII Suburbs + Others 1 81%\n100%\nTotal number of meters\n40,000\nCASE 5\nRevenue and Usage Assumptions (2 of 2)\nUsage of Meters\n• Assume Ring I usage is 12 hours per day, Ring II 8 hours per day, Ring III4 hours\nper day\n• Assume weekend / weekday usage are same (ask them what do they think if you\nwant to assess creativity but then for the math, ask them to assume it’s the\nsame)\n• Assume 30 days a month, 12 months a year\nCASE 5\nCost Assumptions (1 of 2)\nBeyond estimating the value of the revenues from parking meters, the candidate should explain\nwhat costs are necessary to enforce the system. This should include:\n• One-time investment to upgrade the parking meters to accept cash, credit and debit cards.\nFor simplicity, we can assume that the newly installed meters will have a life of 20 years and\nthe bidder will not be expected to change them during the period.\n• Recurring operating expenses – labor costs, maintenance costs, etc.\nOne-time investment\n• 40,000 parking spaces ≠ 40,000 new parking meters.\n• We can assume (or help lead the candidate to assume) that the 40,000 old single-space coin-\noperated meters will be replaced 5,000 new meters (such that each meter is capable of\nhandling 8 spaces)\n• Unit cost for one parking meter could be assumed to be in $20K, including installation costs\nRecurring expenses\n• Candidates should be expected to estimate how many people will be required, the hourly\nwage per worker, ongoing maintenance costs, etc.\nCASE 5\nCost Assumptions (2 of 2)\nRecurring expenses\n• Candidates should be expected to estimate how many people will be required, the hourly\nwage per worker, ongoing maintenance costs, etc.\n• If candidate is stuck you can give the following:\n• Assume on average one person needed to monitor 10 new machines or 80 spaces\n• Assume on average a wage of $10 an hour for 8 hours a day for 300 days a year\n• Assume maintenance cost of $200 per machine per month.\nCASE 5\nDiscount Rate and Growth Rate Assumptions\n• A multi-year estimation also brings in time value of money, which potentially complicates the\nanalysis, but we could always tell candidates to ignore that for purposes of this case (after\nseeing if they even thought about it).\n• Candidates should be expected to put some thought into the risks to consumer demand\nwhen estimating revenues and how it would impact the growth / decline.

These could include variable pricing schemes\n(e.g. surge pricing for busier times of the day) and potentially leasing of parking spots to specific people, or\nwhatever else the candidate can come up with , keeping in mind that there are 20 years for executing these\nschemes. Think MGEC!\n• Candidates could also be asked to think of the different kinds of technological advancements along the way\nthat would help the bidding company stay competitive and boost revenue. For example, the bidding\ncompany could consider launching mobile apps that would inform customers of parking availability if they\nare near a parking meter and would also send alerts if the time is expiring.\n• Depending on how the question goes, the interviewer can also ask questions on reputation and image. For\nexample, in any privatization, the public expects that the quality of service will improve. So what would be\nthe strategy that the candidate would suggest to ensure that?",
  "Wharton_2017_High Engineer Attrition at SLS Oil & Gas Services": "SLS\nOil & Gas Services\nKNOWLEDGE FOR ACTION\n\nCASE 6\nHigh engineer attrition at SLS Oil & Gas Services\nLevel of Difficulty: Hard\nCase Similar to Cases at Firms: Bain and BCG Final Round cases\nTopics Tested: Operations and General Management\nPrompt: Our client SLS is one of the world’s largest oil and gas services provider\noperating in 85 countries and employing about 100,000 people from over 140\ncountries. They help find, scope and drill as much oil and gas as possible for their\nclients – which range from major international oil companies to petrostates such\nas Saudi Arabia and Russia.\nOf late they are seeing a very high attrition rate among their Field Engineer\n(FE) population across several offices globally, the Mumbai office in India being\none of the most affected. The CEO is concerned and has asked you for advice\nspecifically for the Mumbai office. She hopes that if the problem can be fixed in\nMumbai, similar fix can be implemented everywhere else. It is indeed a matter of\ngrave urgency for SLS.\nCASE 6\nFramework and Clarifying Questions (1 of 2)\nOverview for the Interviewer\nThe case is mainly about three things – (1) Clearly understanding the business and the life of an FE in Mumbai\n(2) Identifying the reasons for high attrition in Mumbai (3) Coming up with specific and actionable\nrecommendations for Mumbai\nThis case is heavy on brainstorming and is relatively difficult to structure. It is also more qualitative than\nquantitative. Leave it up to the interviewee to structure as (s)he wishes and give them information only if\nrequested. Since this case is from an industry and function that people might not be familiar with, it is\nimportant to understand the context clearly before diving deeper. If the interviewee gets stuck at any point\nduring the case, feel free to direct them towards what needs to be evaluated.\nSample Clarifying Questions and Answers\nWhat does a Field Engineer do? Field Engineers work with specialized oilfield equipment which they lower inside a\nwell, and then record and analyze data to identify whether and how much oil and\ngas is buried in the ground. They spend a considerable amount of time working on\noil rigs. All oil rigs in Mumbai are offshore i.e. at sea (seeExhibit 1that shows two\ntypes of offshore oil rigs in Mumbai) Most offshore rigs are bad with poor food,\npoor internet and poor accommodation.\nHow is attrition rate defined? (No. of FEs quitting in a year / Avg. no. of FEs in that year) %\nWhere are FEs going? Mostly going to do Masters or moving to a completely different industry\nHow high is the attrition rate? 28% in 2016 in Mumbai (similarly high in several other offices globally)\nWhat has the CEO requested? Identify the cause(s) of high attrition and make recommendations on fixing it\nCASE 6\nFramework and Clarifying Questions (2 of 2)\nSample of Strong Framework\n1. Business in Mumbai and the life of an FE\na. What does SLS do in Mumbai?\nb. What exactly do FEs do and what is a day in the life of an FE like?\ni. Background of the FE\nii. Work-Life balance\nii. Relationship with Managers\n2. Identifying the reasons for high attrition\na. What information to collect and how to collect it\ni. Face to face interviews with managers, FEs, HR etc.\nii. Anonymous questionnaires and feedback forms\nb. Analyze the information – potential reasons for high attrition\ni. Internal (SLS related) reasons\nii. External (non-SLS related) reasons\n3. Recommendations for fixing attrition\na. Short-term\ni. Give more Time-off/Vacation\nii. Team-building activities\niii. Get More engineers\nb. Long-term\ni. Revamp Offshore Staffing Model\nii. Hire FEs compatible with Schlumberger culture\niii. Relook at compensation\nCASE 6\nKey Discussion Points (1 of 4)\n1. Business in Mumbai and the life of an FE (Provide information if asked)\na. What does SLS do in Mumbai?\n> Help major oil and gas companies scope, drill and extract oil and gas from Mumbai offshore\n> Sends equipment and FEs offshore to rigs (that are owned and managed by clients), where the FEs work with\nSLS equipment to meet client’s objectives\nb. What exactly do FEs do and what is a day in the life of an FE like?\n> FEs are hired after undergrad from the best engineering schools around the world\n> SLS has historically offered an unconventional, fast-paced, challenging and extremely rewarding career\n> Two key differentiators for the FEs has been compensation and opportunity for global travel!\n> FEs are hired as Juniors and after ~2 yrs. become Seniors. 1 FE (Sr. or Jr.) stand-by on rig, 2nd FE sent during\noperations; both make bonus when offshore. Optimal time an FE likes to spend offshore before swap is 3 wks.\n> FE would either be offshore (on the rig) stand-by or managing operations, in the office, or on vacation\nExhibit 2 is data for Mumbai office. Ask interviewee for observations. Following should be pointed out –\n> # of engineers has been constant (Has activity been constant? Yes – 25 rigs for the last 5 yrs.)\n> # quit has been going up – answering why and how to resolve is what the case is about!\n> # transferred out went down to 0 – management decision could be demotivating engineers!\n> # transferred in has gone up – is anything being done to improve team-spirit among new and old engineers?\nExhibit 3 shows utilization (% of FEs not on vacation) and effective utilization (% of FEs offshore) trends. Wait\nfor interviewee to ask about relevant information – otherwise show this and ask for observations.\n> Gap widening between the two – fewer FEs on vacation and more FEs sitting in office not making bonus!\n> Managers not using FEs efficiently (Why?) – only 1 or 2 FEs required in the office on any given day.\nCASE 6\nKey Discussion Points (2 of 4)\nMath Question\nThis question is not difficult but requires a very good understanding of the FE staffing model at SLS, which the\ninterviewee should have gotten clarified by now. If not, help her/him proceed.\na. Based on Exhibits 2 & 3, calculate the no. of FEs expected to be in the office any given day.\nb. Now given that on any given day only 2 FEs are needed in the office, 1 standby FE for each of the 25 rigs\nand 36% of the rigs have operations on-going, how high can effective utilization be taken and how many FEs\ncan be sent on vacation?\na.\n50 FEs with a utilization of 80% and effective utilization of 60%.\n40 FEs (50*80%) are at work and 30FEs (50*60%) are on the rig. This translates to 10 FEs being in the office on\nany given day, and 10 on vacation.\nb.\n25 (1*25) standby FEs for each rig + 9 (1*25*36%) FEs on rigs due to operations – This information about 2nd FE\nsent to rig during operations was given earlier to the interviewee in Slide 4. If they miss this, remind them again.\n34 FEs are therefore needed offshore which translates into an effective utilization of 68% (34/50).\nGiven only 2 FEs are needed in the base besides this, 14 FEs can be sent on vacation.\nCASE 6\nKey Discussion Points (3 of 4)\n2. Identifying the reasons for high attrition\na. What information to collect and how to collect it (Ask this Question if interviewee doesn’t)\n> FEs should be interviewed first before managers and HR - in person meeting preferred over a questionnaire\n> Ask about managers, motivation, reasons for their peers quitting, if SLS is meeting their expectations\nb. Potential reasons for high attrition (Ask this Question if interviewee doesn’t. Following are the FACTS\n– agree or disagree with the interviewee as (s)he mentions these)\n> Internal (SLS-related) reasons\n> Management change in 2014 – risk-averse; keeping more people on reserve rather than on vacation\n> Fewer vacations/days-off for FEs and more days in the office – no bonus\n> Those FEs which are offshore are spending a lot of time offshore\nExhibit 4 showing Level Loading should be shared once the above point has been made (or not). This shows\nthe % of FE population spending different amount of time offshore at a single stretch. Remember 3 wks. is\noptimal. Interviewee should drill deeper and enquire about segmentation of this data.\nExhibit 5 shows that Sr. FEs are ‘suffering’ longer runs offshore and Jr. FEs are consequently making lesser\nbonus – both are unhappy! Interviewee should question why this might be happening (otherwise ask them).\nReason is that the new risk-averse management is not confident with Jr. FEs’ competency.\n> No transfer outs – demotivating FEs stuck in the same office for years\n> More new recruits – inadequate cohesion within the group\n> External (non-SLS related) reasons\n> FEs are quitting and going for Masters or switching industries – is SLS recruiting the right people?\n> Compensation difference decreasing between SLS and other companies that require similar skillset\n> Booming start-up culture in India – plenty of exit opportunities\nCASE 6\nKey Discussion Points (4 of 4)\n3. Recommendations for fixing attrition (Interviewee should list most or all of these)\na. Short-term\n> Train Management – Make the offshore staffing system process-driven rather than people-driven\n> Increase vacation/time-off by reducing utilization but offset by increasing effective utilization\n> Swap FEs predictably after they spend ~3 wks. offshore on the rig\n> Make offshore life more enjoyable by sending food, games etc. from town\n> Improve level loading by improving competency of Jr. FEs – track competency and train as required\n> Introduce team-building activities to improve team-spirit\n> Increase vacation/time-off by reducing utilization but offset by increasing effective utilization\n> Swap FEs predictably after they spend ~3 wks. offshore on the rig\n> Make offshore life more enjoyable by sending food, video games etc. from town\nb. Long-term\n> Keep transfer-out rates reasonably healthy as before, or send FEs on short-term assignments outside\nMumbai\n> Recruit the right talent – set expectations correctly during employer info sessions\n> Relook at the compensation structure to make it competitive again\n> Internal or External (i.e. on-campus) marketing to promote the unique work-culture at SLS\n> Hire more engineers (but it will increase cost)\nCASE 6\nExhibit 1\n< Semi-submersible a.k.a. semi-sub\n< Deepwater drillship\nCASE 6\nExhibit 2\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\n# Engineers (start) 50 52 55 51 50\n# Engineers (end) 52 55 51 50 50\n# Hired 6 6 5 2 6\n# Fired 1 2 1 0 0\n# Quit 2 3 7 10 14\n# Transferred Out 4 3 1 0 0\n# Transferred In 3 5 0 7 8\nAttrition % 3.9 5.6 13.2 19.8 28.0\nCASE 6\nExhibit 3\nUtilization & Effective Utilization\n90%\n80%\n70%\n60%\n50%\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\nUtilization Effective Utilization\nCASE 6\nExhibit 4\nLevel Loading\n35%\n30%\n25%\n20%\n15%\n10%\n5%\n0%\n< 1 week 1 - 2 weeks 2 - 3 weeks 3 - 4 weeks > 4 weeks\nCASE 6\nExhibit 5\nLevel Loading vs Seniority\n> 4 weeks\n3 - 4 weeks\n2 - 3 weeks\n1 - 2 weeks\n< 1 week\n0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% 45% 50%\nSr. Jr.",
  "Wharton_2017_Salt Lake City Airport": "Salt Lake City\nAirport\nKNOWLEDGE FOR ACTION\n\nCASE 7\nThe Salt Lake City Airport\nLevel of Difficulty: Easy\nCase Similar to Cases at Firms: Parthenon-EY\nTopics Tested: Brainstorming, Market sizing\nNotes the casegiver: This is a highly structured case without the use of a traditional\nframework. That being said, the interviewee should still structure their thoughts, be\nengaging, and come up with a great final recommendation.\nPrompt: Our company is pitching to the President of the Salt Lake City International\nAirport next week, hoping to earn a big contract with the Airport moving forward.\nWe know that the SLC Airport is the only commercial airport for more than 2.5M\npeople in the greater Salt Lake City area, is the 21st busiest in the nation with 650\nflights per day, and is owned entirely by the City of Salt Lake. The Airport President\nis a mayor-appointed individual who oversees all aspects of the airport’s operation.\nCASE 7\nNotes to the casegiver\n•This case a bit atypical as it does not call for a typical framework. That being\nsaid, answers should still be structured, math should still be organized (and\ncorrect!), and time for brainstorming (10-15sec) should be used.\n•Continually push the interviewee to consider a typical airport and the Salt Lake\nCity market.\n•Continually push the interviewee to use airport related terminology (passengers\nin the terminal not customers buying widgets).\nCASE 7\nOff the top of your head, what are the most important\nthings that the Airport President must think about?\nAnswer guide: A good answer will be structured and consider the various stakeholders of an airport (i.e.\nPassengers, Airlines, Airport Vendors, Security, City Tourism, City Chamber of Commerce).\nExample of a good answer:\nThe three most important things the Airport President should think about when running the airport are the\neffects to Passengers, Airlines, and the Airport’s Vendors.\nPassengers are important because if passengers have a bad experience, they will choose to drive, take the\ntrain, or visitors simply might choose to go to Colorado to go skiing and locals might simply not travel. This will\ncertainly hurt the airport.\nThe Airlines are another key stakeholder, because if they are unhappy they will fly to SLC less. This will hurt the\nlocal business and tourism economy, likely increase airfares if there are fewer flights which hurts passengers,\nand also lead to layoffs if there are fewer passengers.\nThe Airport Vendors are another important stakeholder, because they affect the passenger experience and\nrepresent local jobs. The Airport President should make sure that there are an appropriate number and variety\nof vendors, and similar to a shopping mall, be the intermediary between the different vendors.\nCASE 7\nHow many passengers does the SLC Airport handle\nannually?\nAdditional information to provide when asked:\nWhat is a passenger? A passenger is measured by a person who passes through the airport, either to\n•\nboard or deplane an aircraft. People who are passing through the airport on a layover switching planes are\nconsidered one passenger.\nWhat about people dropping off friends at the airport? Taxi drivers, Uber drivers, and people picking up\n•\ntheir friends are not passengers.\nHow about Pilots, Flight Attendants, and TSA Workers? We are only counting people who have a paid\n•\nticket to fly, not people at the airport for their job.\nAre we counting only one-ways or roundtrips? We are considering each visit to the airport. For\n•\nexample, a family of four traveling roundtrip from SLC to Los Angeles for vacation would count as 8\npassengers (4 when they leave and 4 when they return).\nCASE 7\nHow many passengers does the SLC Airport handle\nannually?\nAnswer guide: A good answer will be structured and break down passengers into usable sub segments.\nExample of an answer (flights based):\nWe know there are 650 flights per day. Let’s say the average plane has 30 rows of 6 seats per row, or 180\nseats per flight. Most flights are 80% full. So we know there must be\n365 Days\nx650 daily flights\nx180 seats per flight\nx75% booked\n= ~34M passengers per year\nCASE 7\nHow many passengers does the SLC Airport handle\nannually?\nAnswer guide: A good answer will be structured and break down passengers into usable sub segments.\nExample of an answer (population based):\nLet’s consider SLC residents and visitors as two separate constituents. Starting with residents, we know there\nare 2.5M people. Let’s break them down into a few groups.\n1. Let’s say 10% are people who travel regularly for work (like consultants). They travel roundtrip every\nweek probably 45 weeks per year. Assuming people live to 100 with equal distribution, we’re really\nonly talking about people 25-65 which is 40 years of 25K people each. That’s 40*25K*2*45=9M\n2. Let’s say the next 10% of workers travel for work, but less frequently. Let’s say they make one trip a\nmonth. That’s 40*25K*2*12= 2.4M\n3. Let’s say the rest of the 80% of adults 25-65 are parents and, with all the kids, they travel once per\nyear for vacation or the holidays. That’s 40*25K*8*2*1= 1.6M and the kids 5-25 (maybe under 5 is too\nyoung) is 20*25K*2*1=1M\n4. Let’s say the senior citizens (older than 65) only travel once per year. That’s 35*25K*2*1=1.75M\nAdding this all up, that’s 9M+2.4M+1.6M+1M+1.75M, or 15.75M resident passengers. Let’s double this\nbecause planes are usually half local and half visitors, so there are 31.5M passengers each year.\nCASE 7\nChoosing between two projects\nQuestion - The President of the airport is thinking about which of two projects to undertake. The money\nto build both has already been accounted for through municipal bonds, so you can ignore construction\ncosts. The first is to open a sit down restaurant in the terminal and the second is to open a lounge in the\nterminal. Which of the two options would you suggest the President pursue?\nAdditional information to provide when asked:\nWhat are the goals or decision criteria? The decision should be based on the criteria you said was\n•\nimportant for the President to consider in part one.\nWhat would be the revenues and costs of the two? The restaurant would bring in a $15 check per\n•\npassenger, and cost $6 per passenger. The lounge would cost $30 per passenger who enters, and cost\n$12 per passenger to provide.\nDoes the airport already have either a sit-down restaurant or a lounge? No, the airport does not have\n•\neither.\nCASE 7\nChoosing between two projects\nAnswer guide: A good answer will be structured, considering the criteria and revenues/costs.\nExample of an answer:\nFirst, let’s consider the financial element. We know a restaurant would earn ($15-$6=) $9 of profit per visitor,\nwhile the lounge would bring in ($30-$12=) $18 of profit per guest. So they are both profitable, and depending\non how many passengers use the two we could say which is more profitable (ie, if there is more than twice the\ninterest in the restaurant, than the restaurant will be more profitable). Earlier I said passenger experience is a\nkey consideration and also airport vendors. Considering the passengers, we know the majority of passengers\nare their for business reasons, and business travelers would most likely prefer a premium lounge. Considering\nairport vendors, while there is not a sit-down restaurant, there must be counter or take-out food vendors who\nwould not like to see a sit-down establishment take away business, so they too would most likely prefer a\nlounge. It seems that a lounge is the way to go.",
  "Wharton_2017_Clothing Chain Acquisitions (Human Capital)": "Clothing Chain\nAcquisition\nKNOWLEDGE FOR ACTION\n\nCASE 8\nClothing Chain Goes Global and Local\nLevel of Difficulty: Medium to Hard\nCase Similar to Cases at Firms: Deloitte Human Capital first- and second-round\ncases\nTopics Tested: mergers and acquisitions, culture, change management, workforce\ndevelopment and stabilization\nPrompt: Yermakov Ltd, a US-based clothing company with stores in 65 countries\nand 100,000 employees based around the world, is in the process of “localizing”\nits image. In addition to continuing to use its traditional supply chain and\nmanufacturing process for many of the Yermakov clothing lines, Yermakov is also\nintroducing new, local lines of fashion. Yermakov’s ability to do this is based on\nthe company’s ongoing acquisition of a dozen high-end boutiques and specialty\nclothing shops. These acquired businesses exclusively use fair trade sourcing,\nhave close relationships across their supply chain and buyer base, and in general\nare much smaller in size that Yermakov – the largest employee base of any of the\ncompanies being acquired is 120 people. These employees have deep,\nspecialized knowledge about their industry and are passionate about local\nfashion and local business.\nCASE 8\nClothing Chain Goes Global and Local\nPrompt, continued:\nYermakov Ltd. has spent the last year working with another consulting firm to\nanalyze and finalize its recent business acquisitions. Yermakov is now\napproaching Deloitte Human Capital because, six months in to this new post-\nacquisition era, the company is experiencing what one of Yermakov’s senior\nstaff referred to as “growing pains.” A large number of employees who worked\nfor the acquired companies declined offers to continue working under the\nYermakov umbrella, and customer acquisition and retention in the local fashion\nmarket has been lower than expected. This is making long-time Yermakov\nemployees anxious, which is affecting their day-to-day performance.\nYermakov has approached Deloitte Human Capital for help stabilizing their\nworkforce and communicating a compelling change agenda.\nCASE 8\nClarifying Questions\nPro tip: Human Capital cases have much longer prompts that typical consulting\ncases, and it’s important to remember what you’ve been told. Don’t hold back on\nthe note-taking!\nPro tip: The interviewee should take a moment to ask 1-2 insightful clarifying\nquestions. Then briefly summarize the case.\nSample Clarifying Questions and Answers\nIs theother consulting firm still working with the client?

How is this affecting performance and business outcomes?)\nStakeholder management\n-\nEmployee engagement (similar to Culture)\n-\nEmployee benefits and rewards (for example, perhaps staff are leaving\n-\nbecause the acquisition change people’s benefits packages in an unappealing\nway, or created a situation where different employees have different benefits,\ngenerating resentment, This can be assessed, addressed and monitored for\nimprovements in staff retention rate – which would be a positive business\noutcome).\nPro tip: there aren’t a ton of Human Capital cases out there, but you can use the\nsame case multiple times – just push yourself to change the work streams each\ntime.\nCASE 8\nPotential questions for the interviewer to ask\nWhy did you prioritize these three work streams?\n-\nLet’s say Yermakov can’t afford to do as much business with us as we would\n-\nlike, at least initially.

How will you\n-\nminimize it?\nI didn’t mention it earlier, but a major part of the challenge of all these\n-\nacquisitions is that each company works on a very different technology\nplatform. How would you deal with this aspect of the acquisition integration?\nCASE 8\nNotes for the interviewer\nWhen the interviewee walked you through their framework, when it came to\n-\nactivities like a stakeholder analysis, did they address both internal AND\nexternal stakeholders? This is important.\nIt is optimal for the interviewee, when talking through their framework, to\n-\nreference firm-specific products, resources, etc. that would be relevant to\nleverage (for example, company learning center that clients can come to,\naffiliate partner that does research in a relevant area, etc.).

If\n-\nnot, prompt them to do so.\nCASE 8\nNotes for the interviewer\nDid the interviewee incorporate human capital market trends into their analysis?\n-\nIf not, ask them which current trends are most relevant to the case in question.\nExamples include the gig economy, automation, millennial workforce\nexpectations, etc.\nWhen the interviewee goes through their framework, it is perfectly acceptable\n-\n(and good practice) for you to ask, “what do you think about XYZ as an\nadditional work stream?” or “for work stream 1, would you consider ABC as an\nactivity instead?” Part of your evaluation of the interviewee should be how\ngracefully they manage this unanticipated shift in direction.\nDid the interviewee make note of dependencies between work streams? If not,\n-\nprompt them about this with a question.\nCASE 8\nSample good answers to brainstorming questions\nQ: What’s the primary reason you think Yermakov is currently experiencing\nworkforce challenges?\nA: Very little advance notice was given to employees of acquired companies about\nthe acquisitions, and very limited information was provided to them about how the\nacquisitions would affect their day-to-day work – work these employees are\nextremely passionate about. This created a lot of unnecessary uncertainty and\nanxiety. It doesn’t sound like Yermakov senior mgmt./HR went out to their newly\nacquired companies to formally welcome people, develop rapport, hear concerns\nor understand the culture of the companies they acquired. If Yermakov had actively\ndone more to demonstrate that it wasn’t just acquiring businesses, but also the\nhuman capital within those businesses, stakeholders would have been more aligned\naround the changes brought about via acquisitions.\nCASE 8\nSample good answers to brainstorming questions\nQ: People get unhappy about this or that at their jobs all the time – it’s normal. Why\nis this such a problem for Yermakov?\nA: People are the most important asset a company has, and when people feel\nundervalued, they underperform and often leave the company. Yermakov just made\na huge investment in acquiring companies, and in this case the human talent,\nnetworks and passion for the work are the most valuable assets they captured. If\nYermakov isn’t able to retain their acquired employees – something which may\nrequire allowing company sub-cultures to flourish – it risks losing major potential\nupside on its investment.\nCASE 8\nSample good answers to brainstorming questions\nQ: Yermakov is making significant investments to change/upgrade its competitive\noffering in the marketplace to include local fashion. Yet, very few people at\nYermakov seem to really understand what local fashion is. These same people are\nambassadors of the Yermakov brand. How can this be addressed?\nA: This is where training comes in. Long-term Yermakov employees may not\nbecome the company’s leading local fashion experts, but they can be trained on\nkey talking points and incentivized to identify synergies as a result of the\nacquisitions. There can be professional rotations at local fashion\nsubsidiaries/acquired companies, site visits, etc. as well.",

If not,\n-\nprompt them about this with a question.\nCASE 9\nSample good answers to brainstorming questions\nQ: You identified several types of training methodologies Waltham&Rose could\nutilize. Is it really necessary to have so many different approaches?\nA: The demographics of the Waltham&Rose employee base have a lot of variation.\nIn the US many of the employees are middle-aged, with a smaller number of\nemployees in their twenties and early thirties. Research shows that people of\ndifferent ages absorb content differently. Particularly in the area of technology\ntraining adoption, where people understand new procedures at platforms at\ndifferent paces, some learners are comfortable learning at their own pace rather\nthan in a classroom setting, and retain information better when they know they have\na video they can always refer back to. Additionally, with employees based in\nmultiple countries and time zones, a multitude of training and learning options will\nhelp ensure everyone has equal access to pertinent information.\nCASE 9\nSample good answers to brainstorming questions\nQ: Waltham&Rose does not have a plan in place when it comes to who will lead the\nnew offices in France and Germany. What are your thoughts on this?\nA: It’s highly recommended that at least one senior executive from the US\nheadquarters relocate, at least for the medium-term, at each of the new offices.\nThis is essential for maintaining company culture, creating cohesion in a newly\ninternational organization, and helping to ensure a seamless transition. Extensive\ninvolvement of the HR Director will also be key. Leadership of the European offices\nby formerly US executives will need to be balanced with German and French hires\nwith senior roles in the new offices. This will ease tensions borne out of cultural\ndifferences, language barriers, lack of local knowledge, etc.\nCASE 9\nSample good answers to brainstorming questions\nQ: You focused a lot on the CRM tool adoption, but didn’t talk much about the\noutsourcing of health benefits. Can you talk a little more about this?\nA: Waltham&Rose are new to outsourcing, and while they are taking this move in\norder to ease workload during a time of growth, they need to be mindful of pain\npoints likely to occur during the transition to outsourcing. Employees typically get\nanxious when unclear changes to their healthcare benefits are looming, which\nnegatively affects performance. It’s also unclear whether Waltham&Rose\nunderstand that there are vastly different healthcare regulations in the US and\nEurope, and multiple outsourcing partners may be required. Additionally, for\noutsourcing to go well it will be important that employees can easily contact their\nnew healthcare benefits manager, and that the process for doing so is clear and\nstraightforward.",

Interviewer reveals it stays at 27$/ton for new production\no volume increases, so total operating costs go up.\n• Revenues: impacted in two ways. Price will likely decrease from increased supply, but volume\nwill go up. Winning effect will come out of the numbers.\n• Investment costs: likely need to invest in new machinery and other technology to get operation\nstarted (when promted, interviewer reveals this will cost $3 Bn upfront, and company looks for 5\nyear non-discounted payback)\nOther important points to consider:\n• Competitive reaction: competitors will suffer from a price decrease due to my increased volume\ntoo.

The\nnew equilibrium price is where the curve meets x = 850 (980 -130), which corresponds\nroughly to 50 $/ton.\n• Interviewee calculates pay-off per year and payback period:\n• New profit = 360 Mty * (50$ - 27$) = $ 8280 MM per year\n• Old profit = 230 Mty * (60$ - 27$) = $ 7590 MM per year\n• Delta profit = $8280 - $7590 = $690 MM per year\n• Payback = = $ 3 Bn / ($ 0.69 MM per year) = ~ 4 years (under 5 year threshold)\nEstimated time: 10 - 15 mins\nCASE 10\nPart 2: Competitor Reaction\nIf not proactively noted, interviewer prompts: how does competitor (example competitor B)\nlikely feel about your move?\n• Interviewee should assess that competitor B will lose $10 margin ($60 - $50 price drop),\nand therefore a total of $10 * 190 Mty (production of B from chart) = $1.9 Bn per year.\n• Interviewee should consider a few options that competitor B has:\n• Competitor B can increase his production if he has access to new mines (price will\ndrop even further, but perhaps volume increase will compensate)\n• Competitor B can temporarily reduce production to make prices go up again\n• Competitor B can work to reduce costs\n• Competitor B can assess M&A options (e.g. Higher cost players that are looking to\nsell, and can potentially have synergies with B’s current operations)\nEstimated time: < 5 mins\nCASE 10\nPart 3: Assume you are now in B’s shoes\nAssume B also has an opportunity to increase production from 190 Mty to 270 Mty (additional\n80 Mty). Also assume this has positive pay-off which gives them a real chance at pursuing such\nproject. What should we do?\n• Interviewee should note that there are 3 additional scenarios to consider:\no If we don’t react to their expansion (i.e. we don’t expand), prices will drop from their\nexpansion and our profits are negatively impacted. From the chart, new price is taken\nfrom x = 980 – 80 = 900. New price = 55 $/ton. That is, we lose a total of\n230 Mty * 5 $/ton = $ 1150 MM per year\no If we do react to their expansion and also increase volume, prices will drop even\nfurther. From their chart, new price is taken from x = 980 – 80 – 130 = 770. New price\n= ~ $ 47 per ton. New profit = 360 Mty * (47$ - 27$) = $ 7200 MM per year. Pay-off\nfrom this scenario is $ 7200 MM - $ 7590 MM = - $390 MM per year\no If we neither company expands: delta profits are zero.\n• Interviewee should be able to assess that given the four pay-off scenarios there is only one\ndominant strategy for client A: expand. (see example of illustration in the next slide)\nEstimated time: 10-15 mins\nCASE 10\nExample illustration of part 3:\nClient (Company A)\nDo Not Expand Expand\n+ $0.69B\nd 0\nn\na\np\nx\n) E\nB\nt\ny o\nn N\na 0 - $1.9 B\np o\nm D\no\nC\n(\nr\no\nt i - $1.15B -$0.39B\nt\ne\np\nd\nm\nn\no a\np\nC\nx\nE\n* *\nDominant strategy for A\n* Calculation of competitor B pay-offs can be calculated from case data, but are not relevant\nto decision\nCASE 10\nConclusion – final pitch\nSummary to the CEO:\n• Our recommendation is that our client should expand.\n• Given our baseline projection, increased pay-off from expansion is ~ $700 MM per\nyear, which is enough to payback investment in less than 5 years\n• Larger scale gives us competitive advantage (flexibility to increase and reduce\nproduction as market fluctuations may occur, better power with buyers and suppliers,\netc.)\n• Even considering that our competition may react, expanding makes sense:\n• Regardless of what B chooses to do, we are better off expanding. If they expand, we\nare minimizing our loss from - $1.15 Bn to - $0.39 Bn. If they don’t expand, we have\nthe potential to gain $0.69 Bn per year.\nEstimated time: 30 seconds",

This product is currently sold in liquid vials. The\nproduct is typically applied with a sponge during post-op. Medical Devices is considering a\ndeal with a sponge manufacturer named Spongy’s to create a hybrid product that combines a\nsponge with the BloodStopper product. The combined product will include BloodStopper in\na dry, tablet form. Spongy’s will sell the final product.\nShould Medical Devices do a deal with Spongy’s? If so, what terms should they negotiate?\nFor Interviewer:\nThis case has three main components -\n1. Analysis to determine the potential price of the new combined product\n2. Analysis to determine how the cost structure for the combined product would change\nfrom the original products, and what difference that makes for each company’s margin\n3. Brainstorm/conclusion on how the deal should be structured given (1) and (2)\nCASE 16\nFramework and Clarifying Questions\nSample Strong Framework:\nA. Consumers - Who are they? Where, and how many? What benefit does the combined product provide\nto consumers versus the original liquid vial? What is the WTP for liquid vial and the sponge\nindependently? What is the WTP for the combined product?\nA. Product – Does Medical Device Co. own the IP on BloodStopper? Is there anything “unique” about the\nsponge? What is the difference in cost between the liquid form and tablet form of BloodStopper? What\nare the margins on the sponge? What are the margins for each player in the combined product?\nA. Competition – Are there other companies making a product like BloodStopper? What are the barriers to\nentry? Are there other sponge manufacturers?\nA. Deal Structure – Should Medical Device Co. proceed by selling to Spongy’s, seek out a different\npartner, or restructure the arrangement?\nSample Clarifying Questions and Answers\nIf Spongy’s sells the final product, does Medical Yes, the proposed plan is for Medical Devices to sell\nDevices sell the tablet to Spongy’s? the tablet to Spongy’s.

None that we know of right now.\nCASE 16\nConsumers & The Product\nA. Consumers – Candidate should drive to define B. Product – Candidate should seek to determine\nthe BloodStopper and sponge consumer, what whether Medical Device Co. or Spongy’s is the\nthey pay now, and willingness to pay for combined more powerful player by analyzing margins and\nproduct. evaluating how “special” each product is.\nInformation to Provide if Asked Information to Provide if Asked\nCustomers: 1,000 hospitals with operating rooms, ● Medical Device Co. owns IP on BloodStopper\n● Nothing especially unique about the sponges\nthroughout the U.S.\nProduct Costs:\nBenefits: The combined product -\n● Sponge - $2 to manufacture\n● Enables greater efficiency in operating rooms\n● BloodStopper - Show next slide: “What price\n● Preferred by buyers since no need to make\nwould Medical Device Co. charge Spongy’s\nseparate purchases of BloodStopper (glass vial)\nto maintain its margin?”\nand sponge\n○ Brainstorm: types of costs & how change\n● No proven improved medical benefit\n○ Costs: original vial = $5; tablet = $3.50\nPricing:\nProduct Margin:\n● WTP for Original Liquid Vial = $85\nCandidate should calculate:\n● WTP for Standalone Sponge = $10\n● Original margin with liquid vial: $85 - $5 = $80\n● WTP increases by 10% for the combined\n● To maintain $80 margin, Medical Device Co.\nproduct.\nwould charge Spongy’s $83.50 for combined.\n● Assume all products are single use\n● Spongy’s combined product margin =\nCandidate should calculate new price: $104.5 – 83.50 - 2 = $19\n● Combined Product = ($85 +10)* 1.1 = $104.5\nInsight: For Medical Device Co. to maintain its high\nmargin, would mean high COGS for Spongy’s.\nCASE 16\nCost Breakdown\nThe costs to Medical Device Co. for the BloodStopper product in the original liquid\nvial form versus in tablet form are as follows:\nPer Unit\nBloodStopper BloodStopper\nLiquid Vial Tablet Form\nCost of Goods Sold\nRaw materials $1.00 $0.90\nManufacturing $0.25 $0.20\nPackaging $0.15 $0.10\nDirect Labor $2.10 $1.80\nSales & Marketing $1.50 $0.50\nCASE 16\nCompetition & Deal Brainstorm\nInterviewer Guidance: Competition element is not a focus. Key significance is Medical Device Co. could\nconsider doing the deal with another company, or acquire one of Spongy’s competitors. Candidate should\ninclude figures from margin calculations in justifying decision on deal.\nC. Competition – Candidate should recognize that BloodStopper is not in a competitive market, while\nSpongy’s product is common enough that there are several players.\nCandidate sample questions: Are there other companies making a product like BloodStopper? What are the\nbarriers to entry? Are there other sponge manufacturers?\n● There are 10 large sponge makers.\n● There are no other companies that make a product like BloodStopper. It is not easy to replicate.\nD. Deal Structure – Ask the candidate if current deal structure makes sense, and what could be some\nalternatives?\n● Current deal – Could be a challenge since Spongy’s would have such a high COGS if Medical Devic Co.\nmaintains its margin\n● Vertical integration – Who should buy whom? Why?\n○ Given that Medical Device has much higher margins and a more “special” product,\n● Volume-based discounting – Incentivizes Spongy’s to push sales\n● Revenue Sharing – Implement thresholds to encourage sales\nCASE 16\nConclusion\nShould Medical Device Co. sell their product to Spongy’s, and if so how?\nSample Conclusion: Medical Device Co. should not do the do the deal as proposed. For Medical Device Co. to\nmaintain its $80 margin per product, Spongy’s would have to assume a high COGS and would realize a much\nlower profit than Medical Device Co. This could put Medical Device Co. at risk of not having the improved\naccess to marketing and distribution channels partially intended by going into business with Spongy’s. As an\nalternative, Medical Device Co. should plan to vertically integrate by buying the sponges from Spongy’s or\nacquiring another sponge manufacturer, since there are numerous potential targets and Medical Device Co.\nhas a stronger financial position relative to Spongy’s.\nA strong conclusion:\n● Recognizes current deal economics may not favor Spongy’s as end distributor of the product\n● Proposes alternative deal structure and puts forth the “why?”",

Please take note of the following:\nSupplier Vivid\n(backlighting) (screens) TV Manuf Retailer\nCost: $200 $200 $300 $150\nProfit: $20 $30\nWith the information we’ve gathered so far, what can you tell me about the\ndistribution of surplus (profit) in the supply chain, and the TV manufacturer’s\nwillingness to pay for Vivid’s TV screens?\nCASE 17\nCase Data (3): Value chain cost structure\nSupplier Vivid\n(backlighting) (screens) TV Manuf Retailer\nCost: $200 $200 $300 $150\nProfit: $20 (A) (B) $30\nSolution:\n(A) (B)\nSum known SC components Retail price – subtotal =\nAvg Price – Cost = Profit Manuf. profit\n$200 + $20 = $220\n$228 - $200 = $ 28 $1,000 – 928 = $72\n$200 + $28 = $228\n$300 + ___ = $300\n$150 + $30 = $180\nSubtotal: $928\nCASE 17\nCase Data (3): Value chain cost structure\nExample Key takeaways:\n• There is $150 in profit surplus distributed throughout the supply chain. Vivid\nretains ~$28 of that profit, which is better than the backlighting supplier, but\nconsiderably less than the TV manufacturer, who’s retaining nearly half of all\nsurplus at $72.\n• Key question going forward: How strong is Vivid’s value-add? Should they be\nkeeping a greater portion of the pie?\nCASE 17\nCase Data (4): Customer feedback\nPresent the candidate with Exhibit 2 (interview excerpts)\nPrompt: What can we take from this?\nExample Key takeaways:\n• Manufacturing customers exhibit both a high willingness-to-pay for Vivid’s\nquality and a high switching cost to any other supplier. There’s a clear\nopportunity for Vivid to explore a price increase.\n• Vivid’s salesforce is subject to a high-pressure sales quota with the aim of\nincreasing market share. As we’ve seen, this is likely creating a discount-\nheavy sales culture which leaves profit on the table due to excessive price\nerosion.\nCASE 17\nExhibit 2: Internal/External Interviews\nCustomer interviews (manufacturers)\n“Although other screen technologies are cheaper, this\n“We built a $1 billion plant to produce HDTVs this\nproduct gives the quality we need to charge the prices\nyear. The plan only works with VIVID’s screens”\nwe charge on the street.”\nInternal interviews (sales)\n“Although we have discount floors in the TV division,\nwhen we are getting closer to the end of the quarter, I “If the management keeps asking us to grow our\nneed to close the deals to reach my sales quota. The market share, we need to lower our prices to increase\ncompetition is too strong in this market and I need to our sales, it’s the law of demand, basic economics!”\ngive the discounts.”\n“We can give higher discounts every year\nbecause our costs go down every year too.”\nCASE 17\nWrap-up\nPrompt: Your team is on the weekly update call with Vivid’s CEO and she wants to\nget straight to the point. What did you find in the data? What are the action items?\nThe project manager nods your way. Go.\nExample Key takeaways:\n• Cost structure & Internal interviews: We know that price erosion and continued\nrampant discounting is untenable, given the leveling off of cost reductions.\n• Data and Internal interviews: There is a misalignment of sales force incentives.\nThey are rewarded for reaching volume quotas, and usually end up giving a\ndiscount just up to the discount floor, or cave on price all the way down to\nvariable cost. There is a need for a more granular discount authority system\nand a variable price component to sales compensation.\n(continued on next slide)\nCASE 17\nWrap-up\nExample Key takeaways (cont’d):\n• Value Chain: There is $100 of surplus to be split among the TV manufacturer\nand Vivid. Right now Vivid is getting ~$28 of that pie. That could be viewed as\ngood, given the fact that other suppliers make only $20 profit, but on the other\nhand, customers have a very high opinion of the value of the screens and have\nhigh switching costs. Vivid should target a price increase. (A $40/$60 split of\nthe surplus offers the most compelling message, as both players would then\nhave 20% return on sales. This would mean a Vivid ASP of $240).",

  "AGSM_CABLE TELEVISION COMPANY": "CABLE TELEVISION COMPANY  \n \nQ:  Your client is a small holding company th at ow ns three cable television companies in the \nNortheast:  Rochester, NY, Philadelphia and Stamford, CT.  Each of these three companies is \nprofitable, and each has been experiencing stea dily grow ing sales over the past few  years.  \nHow ever, the management feels that th e Northeast is not the fastest grow ing area of the \ncountry, and, therefore, acquired another cable te levision company in Tucson, Ariz ona a little \nover a year ago.  Despite every effort of management, the Tucson company’s sales have been \nstagnant, and the company has been losing money.  How  would you analyz e this situation, and \nwhat could be the cause of the poor performance of the Tucson cable company? \n \nTo be divulged gradually:  \n \nThe Tucson area is sm aller than Philadelphia, but larger than Rochester and Stam ford.  Tucson is \nalso growing at 12% per year on average.  Per capita incom e is higher than in Philadelphia and \nthe sam e as in Rochester and in Stam ford. \n \nOperating costs in Tucson are essentially the sam e as in the other m arkets.  The cost of \nprogram ming is based on num ber of subscribers and is equal across the nation.  Operating costs \nare com posed of variable item s:  sales staff, m aitenence, adm inistration and m arketing.  Only \nmaintenance is higher that in the other m arkets, due to the larger land area serviced.  Fixed costs \nrelate to the cable lines, which is a function of physical area covered. \n \nThe Tucson com pany has attem pted m arketing efforts in the past, such as free Disney \nprogram ming for  one m onth, free HBO for one month, free hookup, etc.  These program s have \nbeen m odeled after the other three m arkets. \n \nCable penetration rates in the three Northeastern m arkets average 45%.  The penetration rate in \nTucson is 20%.  These rates have been steady over the past three years in the Northeast.  The \npenetration rate in Tucson has only rised by 2% in the past three years in Tucson. \n \nThere is only one real substitute good for cable television:  satellite dishes.  However, m any \ncommunities are enacting legislation that lim its their usage in Tucson.  They are also \nprohibitively expensive f or most people. \n \nSolution : \n \nThe real error of m anagem ent results from  their failure to recognize another “substitute” good:  \nno cable television at all; television reception is far better in the desert Southwest than in \nNortheastern cities.  The lower penetration rate is m ost likely a result of  different clim ate \nconditions and lower interference in Arizona.  \n \n \n  \nPage 21",
  "AGSM_CHILLED BEVERAGES": "CHILLED BEVERAGES \n \nYou are consulting for the manager of a division of a large consumer products company.  \nHer division produces fruit juices in three forms, all marketed under the same name:  \nchilled (found in the milk section of the superm arket, usually), juice boxes, and froz en \nconcentrate.  This division has sales of $600 million per year.  The entire company has sales \nof over $20 billion.  The chilled segment represents $120 million in sales per year.  While \njuice boxes and froz en concentrate are profitab le, chilled juices are only breaking even in \ngood quarters and losing money in bad quarters.  She has received a proposal from upper \nmanagement to sell the chilled juices busine ss.  What w ould you advise that she do? \n \nTo be divulged gradually : \n \nChilled beverages is a $5 billion dollar industry nationw ide.  There are tw o large players \nthat have 40%  and 25%  of the market, respectively.  Your client’s market share, 12% , \nmakes her third in the industry.   \n \nThe best available information indicates that the tw o market leaders are profitable. \n \nThe tw o market leaders are able to fund more advertising and more promotion, trade and \ncouponing that your client. \n \nThe m arket leaders produce pure orange juice and blends that are based on citrus juices.  Your \nproduct uses m ore elaborate blends of juices, usually with a base of pear or peach juice (95% of \nthe inputs) and flavored with cranberries, bananas,  mangoes, etc. (the other 5% of the inputs).   \nPear and peach juice are about the sam e price as or ange juice, but the other flavorings cost about \ntwice as m uch. \n \nThe m arket for chilled juices is essentially m others with school age children.  This is a highly \nprice sensitive m arket that loves coupons, prom otions, etc. \n \nBrand nam e is im portant in this m arket, as in juice boxes and frozen concentrate, as m others tend \nto prefer highly reliable products for their children.  However, the brand prem ium must be in line \nwith other branded products.  Therefore, all branded juices tend to sell in the sam e price range. \n \nOne plant in California produces all of the product, chilled, juice boxes and frozen.  It would be \ndifficult to find another use for the plant without a m ajor conversion. \n \nSolution:  \n \nThere are three choices: \n  \n  \nPage 22 Sell the chilled juice business.  This would, however, af fect the juice bix and f rozen concentrate \nbusinesses, as there are both advertising and m anufacturing synergies. \n \nSell all of the juice business.  This m ay be m ore feasible, as the buyer could capture the \nsynergies, but would not be too likely to turn the business around.  The selling price is likely to \nbe low. \n \nKeep the chilled juice business and rework the ingredients and costs.  This turns out to be the \nmost feasible option, as evidenced by the success of the com petitors.",

In 27 states, where alcohol is sold in privately \nmanaged superm arkets and liquor stores, “open” states, shelf space is extrem ely expensive and \ntrade prom otions are critical.  Such stores are alsom  becom ing less and less willing to hold \ninventory, which is increasing distribution costs by requiring m ore frequent deliveries.

Distribution costs in \nthese states is m uch lower, as there are far fewer outlets to service and central warehouses for the \nstate-run stores.  Advertising of alcohol is much m ore tightly regulated, and therefore, \nadvertising spending is lower. \n \n \nSolution:  \n \nA greater and greater share of the volum e is being sold in the “open” states, with sales in these \nstates increasing at about 10% per year.  Sales in the regulated states are actually decreasing.  \n  \nPage 23 Because the regulated states are less expensive to serve, and therefore, m ore profitable, the fact \nthat they represent a shrinking portion of the total has caused total profits to decline.",

After considering thes e factors, would you recom mend the acquisition? \n \nAdditional Inform ation to be divulged gradually : \n \nThe target f irm is currently prof itable, with m argins of 5%.  Your client’s m argin is 15%.   Your \nclient attributes its higher profit m argin to econom ies of scale in trucking and m ixing, and a \nstable labor force. \n \nBoth com panies com pete in the geographical m arket, the Southeastern U.S.  Your client’s \ncustom ers are large construction firm s and contractors generally in the office and com mercial \nbuilding construction business.

The sm aller firm  has strong contacts with m any \nlocal custom ers, and is often the preferred supplier due to their custom er responsiveness.   \n \nYour client is not able to fund the acquisition in ternally, but could obtain bank financing at a rate \nof 10%.  Sim ilar acquisitions generally are m ade for two to three tim es current sales of the target \nfirm. \n \nSolution : \nFrom  a financial point of view, the acquisition is not attractive if there are no synergies between \nthe firms.  W ith prof it margins of  only 5%, the incom e generated by the sm aller f irm will not \ncover the capital charges (interest due to the bank) on the acquisition price.  (Acquisition price = \n3 x sales.  Interest on this am ount will be 10% x 3 x sales, or 30% of annual sales.  Profits are \nonly 5% of sales.  This analysis, of course, ignores the tax shields.) \n \nHowever, if your client were able to use som e of its com petitive advantages to im prove the \nfinancial outlook of the target firm , the acquisition w ould be advisable.

W ithin f ive years, it is expected that Vader and the large processors will dom inate this \nmarket. \n \nVader had a significant cost advantage over sm aller operations, such as the Bank of Luke, because \nof the great econom ies of scale they gain from  processing such volum es of item s. In addition, Vader \nbenefits from  a more constant workload by processing both airline tickets and retail lock box \nreceipts: airline tickets have few peaks and valleys, whereas m ortgage paym ents always peak early \nin the m onth with very low volum es the rest of the m onth. Mr. Check believes that Vader quotes \nprices of 20 cents per item  to large prospective custom ers while the Bank of Luke processes item s \nfor 40 cents per item . \n \nThe President of the Bank, Mr. Kenobi, has asked Mr. Check to evaluate how the retail lock box \nservice can be m ade profitable; the service lost $100,000 last year. Mr. Check believes that the bank \nmust offer retail lock box services, and it m ust price the service to be com petitive with com panies \nsuch as Vader. Recognizing that outside expertise will be needed, the President has given Mr. Check \na budget to be used to hire a consulting firm . Mr. Check has asked you to visit his office to discuss \nthe proposed engagem ent.

After reviewing som e background inform ation with \nyou, Mr. Check asks you the following questions: \n \nQuestion #1  \n \nWhat do you see as your (the consultant' s) role at the Bank of Luke?  \n \nQuestion #2  \n \nWhat steps would you take and what inform ation would you gather to diagnose the problem s facing \nthe Retail Lock Box Departm ent and to develop solutions to those problem s? \n  \nPage 45  \nQuestions #3  \n \nFrom  what you now know, what are the problem s facing the item  processing service and what \nrecom mendations would have the greatest im pact on the perform ance of the Bank of Luke and the \nitem processing service?  \n \n Answer \nIn this case, we want to test the candidate' s ability to handle a case in which the events appear \nhopeless until the end. W hen an apparently easy solution (autom ation) is m ade available.  The \ncandidates should challenge the general prem ise of the case, and not sim ply believe that the business \nis necessary just because Mr. Check says so. W e also want to test creativity with this case. W e \npurposely leave the case rather vague, not suggesting any particular actions and offering little data. \nThe candidate should be given tim e to think about this case and propose solutions which are not \nreadily apparent: \n \n• Why not sell the business of these custom ers? \n• Why not offer increased services to justify higher fees?  \n• What is the strategic plan for the bank, and how does this unit fit into it?  \n• What does Mr. Check feel his unit should be generating?   (after all, $15,000 per em ployee is \npretty  low!) \n• Has he considered acquiring other banks’ custom ers to increase the econom ies of scale in his \nown operation?  \n \nThis case can also be used to discuss cost-cutting. Again, creativity and sensitivity to the real issues \nshould be the goals of your probe; cutting 25% of, the staff is too obvious and too easy.",

Describe the instrum ent and what it does.

Y is an accessory for larger and m uch m ore expensive instrum ent that \nfunctions alm ost exactly like a m icroscope, which we' ll call X. \n \n2.  What other products does our client m anufacture?  (Goal: gather background \ninformation on the client). \n \n  Response:  They recently began m anufacturing X, and also produce an unrelated \nproduct. \n \n  \nPage 52 3.  Can these instrum ents be used separately, and are they ever sold separately?  (Goal: \nunderstand the sales process and the potentially interactive role of the X and Y sales \nforces). \n \n  Response: X can be used by itself, but Y is essentially dependent on X for its \noperation. As a result. except for replacem ent sales, Y is rarely sold individually.  In \nfact, X' s sales force will frequently recom mend that a buyer purchase a certain Y \nwhile buying an X. Two years ago, over 30% of our clients sales were generated by a \nmanufacturer of X. \n \n4.  What is the current %?  (Goal: determ ine whether this could be a cause of the sales \ndecline). \n   \n  Response:  It is currently around 5% \n \n5.  Does our product X com pete with other m anufacturers of X, and particularly the \nmanufacturer that was selling our Y?   (Goal: understand reasons for our friendly X \nmanufacturer stopping prom otion of our product). \n \n  Response:  Yes it does com pete directly with it, and our client introduced the product \nabout 1 1/2 years ago. (You have discovered a significant portion of the sales \ndecline). \n \n6.  How does our product com pare to other Y' s? (Goal: determ ine whether others are \nbeating us on technological or other product features). \n \n  Response:  Our client' s product is regarded as one of the best in the m arket. \n \n7.  Is the m arket for X and Y growing, shrinking or flat?  (Goal: a shrinking m arket \ncould be a good explanation for declining com pany sales). \n \n  Response:  Both m arkets are flat. \n \n8.  Who uses X and Y?  (Goal: determ ine m arket segm ents). \n \n  Response:   There are two basic user groups: industry, prim arily sem iconductor \nmanufacturers, and academ ia (in research labs). W hat we' ve noticed lately is that the \nspecific users in each of these groups, who also happen to be the prim ary buyers, \nhave becom e relatively less sophisticated; that is, they are hired just to run the \ninstrum ents and know less about their technical qualities. These buyers have becom e \neven m ore dependent on the sales forces. W hat has happened is that our client \nalienated itself from  other m anufacturers of X at a tim e when a strong relationship \nwas becom ing even m ore im portant than it used to be. The buyers are relying m ore \nand m ore on the X sales force, who is typically called well in advance of the Y sales \n  \nPage 53 force. (The interviewer will not likely give you all of this inform ation at once.  \nQuestions about the buying process and changing decision m akers would have \nbrought it out) \n \n  This is the second part of the m ain reason for our clients declining sales:  in addition \nto \n  ruining our relationship with a m anufacturer of X by producing our own, we \nhappened to do so at a tim e when relationships becam e even m ore im portant.",

  "AGSM_CONSULTING FIRM STRATEGY": "CONSULTING FIRM STRATEGY  \n \nCase Overview  \n \nYou are the newest m ember on the m anagem ent com mittee of a well-known top-tier strategy \nmanagem ent consulting firm .  Eager to be accept ed by your m ore senior peers, you volunteer to \nstudy the industry and propose a firm  strategy for the 1990' s, which you will present to the \ncommittee at its next m eeting. As you leave the m eeting you begin to realize the enorm ous task to \nwhich you' ve com mitted yourself. \n \nl.  How do you evaluate the consulting environm ent and determ ine likely future \nscenarios? \n2.  What inform ation do you use in this process?  How is this inform ation obtained?  \n3.  What do you believe is m ost likely to happen in the consulting industry given your \npresent knowledge?  How did you arrive at this conclusion?  \n4.  What strategy do you propose to the m anagem ent com mittee? \n \nProposed Answer  \n  \nPage 58  \nThis is one of the m ost difficult types of cases  because the answers are com pletely unknown and will \nvary substantially depending upon the interviewee' s knowledge of the industry.  This is also an \nintresting case since the salience is likely to be high. As an interviewer you should feel free to add \ninform ation on an as-needed basis. W hen inform ation isn' t available, ask the Interviewee to develop \nhis or her own hypotheses. W hat matters here is the thinking process, not necessarily the answer. \n \n1.  A good place to begin is to evaluate the industry from  a com petitive analysis \nperspective, such as Porter' s five forces. The following is an abbreviated analysis. \n \n \n  Rivalry (low to m oderate):  managem ent consulting is fragm ented, with m any players \neach holding relatively sm all concentration of total m arket. Firm s act as com petitive \nmonopolists, and differentiate them selves by specialty, type of custom er (Fortune \n100 versus Fortune 1000 com panies), reputation (McKinsey versus accounting \nfirms), and the resources they em ploy (top MBAs versus all MBAs). Many \ncompanies are relationship-driven with their custom ers, which lim its com petition and \nkeeps prices high. Top tier firm s in particular are able to have high price points. \n \n  Potential Entry (moderate):  there are no great barriers to entry into consulting; \nhowever, few new consulting firm s truly com pete in the top tier. It' s possible new \nfirms would enter if the industry were earning positive econom ic profits and if they \nfaced certain im itability (e.g. the ability to recreate what the top tier firm s do). \n \n  Substitutes (moderate):  com panies can m ove the consulting process in-house by \nhiring exconsultants and bright MBAs. \n \n  Buyer Bargaining Power (m oderate-high):   In the last decade the consulting m arket \nhas boom ed, with supply generally following dem and, which lowers buyer power. \nHowever, it is appropriate to question effect recession m ight have on industry. It' s \npossible that dem and m ay decrease as com panies quit expanding, which would \nreduce dem and, give buyers m ore bargaining power, and push prices lower. \n \nSupplier Bargaining Power (low-m oderate):  Major suppliers are the intellectual capital em ployed \nby firm  (e.g. experienced consultants who bring in sales and new consultants who \nprovide analytics). Must pay m arket price or risk losing suppliers. \n \nOther interesting points m ight explore the key success factors in the consulting industry. W hat sets \ntop tier f irms from middle ones?  Do any f irms have specif ic sustainable com petitive advantages? \nHow does the m arketing m ix differ am ong firm s? Does your firm  have any specific core \ncompetencies or advantages that set it apart from  other com panies? \n \nDeterm ining likely future scenarios is m ore am biguous. There are at least several key point: what \neffect will a recession have on consulting firm s? W ill top tier firm s suffer differently from  others? \n  \nPage 59 How will the m ix of products dem anded change (e.g. cost-cutting studies rather than m arket \nexpansion studies)? W ill the consulting m arket continue to expand or suf fer a cutback?  Or, will \ncertain geographical areas expand (Pacific Rim , Eastern Europe) faster than others?   Again, the \nthought process is m ore im portant here than actual answers. \n \n2.  Inform ation gathering is a key reason com panies use consultants. An interviewee \nshould have a decent understanding of business inform ation sources and how \ninform ation is gathered. \n \n  Inform ation can be broken into two groups: secondary and prim ary. Usually one \nbegins with secondary m aterial, specifically, a com plete review of published \nliterature (a \"lit search\") pertaining to the study (e.g. journal and newspaper articles, \ninvestm ent bank research, specialized studi es, books, etc.). This often points towards \nother good sources (e.g. industry experts, associations, m ajor com petitors, \ngovernm ent sources, etc.).  Hypotheses are often created from  the secondary \ninform ation. Prim ary research is then used to focus in on the key issues.   This \nresearch includes telephone interviews, in-person interviews, m ailed questionnaires, \nfocus groups, laboratory experim ents, etc. \n \n3.  This answer will depend upon the m aterial covered in the first two. Ask the \nquestions: W hat trends are likely?  W hat is a positive scenario?  A negative one?  If  \nyou had any inform ation at your disposal, how could you get a better handle on this \nissue?  \n \n4.  There is no right answer here, so the interviewee m ay balk. However, you can \nprovide som e structure. W hat are the key success factors to succeeding in the \nindustry?  Is there any way to achieve sustainable advantage which cannot he \nduplicated by your com petitors?  Can you use non-traditional m ethods to achieve \ncompetitive advantage, such as leveraging through technology.  Given your firm 's \ncompetitive strengths and core com petencies, what is the best strategic route?",
  "AGSM_SELECTIVE BINDING CASE": "SELECTIVE BINDING CASE \n \nYour client is a m ajor fashion m agazine that has been offered by its printer a proprietary new \nprocess called selective binding which enables publishers to custom ize the pages included in readers'  \nmagazines based on dem ographic data known about the reader. For exam ple, an ad in Better Hom es \n& Gardens for lawn chem ical services could be placed only in those issues going to subscribers who \nlive in houses and not to those living in condom inium s or apartm ents. In this way, advertisers can \nfocus their com munications on the dem ographic segm ent they are targeting. W ould you advise your \nclient io take advantage of this new process and offer selective binding to its advertisers?  \n \nAnalysis  \n \nThis is a pretty straightf orward cost/benefit analysis.  The Magazine would want to consider offering \nthe service to its advertisers if it would be able to enhance its earnings by being able to charge its \nadvertisers a prem ium for being able to m ore exactly and efficiently target the dem ographic segm ent \nthey want to reach. Of course the increased revenue from  the any prem ium must be able to offset any \nrevenue lost as advertisers stopped targeting.  The interviewee could start the analysis by obtaining \nthe following inf ormation f orm the interviewer: \n \nQ: What dem ographic breakdowns can be m ade in the m agazine' s database?  \n \nA: The only breakdown possible on your database is between subscribers who m ake under \n$50,000 and those who m ake over $50,000. \n \nQ: What it total readership, the proportion of readers who are subscribers (as opposed to \nnewsstand buyers), and the proportion of subscribers in each dem ographic category?  \n \nA: There are l m illion readers, 80% of  who are subscribers. Twenty-f ive percent of  subscribers \nmake under $50×000, 75% m ake over $50,000.  The sam e mix applies to the newsstand \nbuyers according to readership audits. \n \nQ: What proportion of the client' s advertisers target each dem ographic category of readers?  \n \nA: Most advertisers are selling high-end fashion products, so 75% of them  are targeting the high \nincom e group. \n \n  \nPage 62 Q: What is the cost of the selective binding service and what does the m agazine charge for its \nads? \n \nA: The service is being offered to your client fr ee for 3 years since the printer wants to prom ote \nthe service' s use by getting a m ajor m agazine to start using it. The client charges $50 per \nthousand per full-page ad (selective binding can only be offered on full-page ads). Therefore \nrevenue associated with a single inserted page (front and back) in an issue is $100 per \nthousand. \n \nQ: What does the client' s closest direct com petitor f or advertisers charge f or ads and what is \ntheir readership like? \n \nA: The client' s closest direct com petitor has 500,000 readers, 100% of whom  are subscribers. \nEffectively, all of their readers m ake over $50,000. They charge $70 per thousand for their \nfull one page ads. \n \nSince the printing cost to the client of selective binding is zero, the client sim ply needs to evaluate \ncost on the basis of revenue per thousand gained or lost as their advertiser base uses the \nservice to better target their ads to their desired segm ent. Presum ably, instead of 100% of \nadvertisers paying the full $50/thousand per page, the 25% of advertisers targeting the lower \nincom e segm ent will choose to advertise only to the 25% of subscribers targeting the high \nincom e segm ent will choose to advertise only to the 25% of subscribers falling into that \nsegm ent and the 75% of  the advertisers targeting the high incom e segm ent will advertise \nonly to the high incom e subscribers (75% of subscribers). Assum e that all advertisers \ncontinue to advertise in 100% of the newsstand copies. The revenue effect of this change can \nbe calculated by looking at the im pact the change would have on average ad rate per \nthousand on subscription readership: \n \nNew ad revenue per page = Old ad revenue per page X [(% low incom e subscribers X % low \nincom e target advertisers) + (96 high incom e subscribers X % high Incom e advertisers)] \n \nThus \n \nNew ad revenue per page = $50 X [(25% X 25%) + (75% X 75%)] \nat old rate $31.25 < $50 \n \nNow the question is, can ad rates per thousand on the selective binding portion of ads sold be \nincreased sufficiently to increase average revenue per thousand over what it is today?   To answer \nthis question, your client' s ad rates m ust be looked at from  the perspective of their advertisers. If you \nconsider the advertisers targeting the high incom e group, their alternative to advertising in your \nclient' s magazine is to put their ad dollars toward the 100% high-incom e readership com petitor. The \ncost per thousand high-incom e readers with the com petitor m agazine is: \n \n  \nPage 63 (Page rate X total readership)/ (portion of  readers who are high incom e) = ($70 X 500,000)/500,000 \n= $70 \n \nThus $70 is the m aximum price per thousand the client can charge its advertisers for selectively \nbound ads before the advertisers would switch to their com petitor. Note that currently, the client is a \ncheaper buy for these high-incom e advertisers even though they are paying to reach readers they do \nnot want: \n \n($50 X 1 m illion)/750,000 = $66.67 \n \nIf the client charged $70/thousand for selectively bound ads, average revenue per thousand to the \nclient would be: \n \n$70 X [(255 X 25%) + (75% X 75%)) = $43.75 \n \nSince $43.75 is less than the $50 that advertisers are currently paying, the m agazine should not offer \nadvertisers the selective binding service. \n \nOf course, there are other issues which interviewees m ight want to m ention such as the possibility of  \nprice discrim inating between high and low incom e advertisers, the potential for and cost of \nexpanding the advertising base using selective binding as a selling tool, etc. However, it is im portant \nby the end of the interview to have reached a recom mendation regarding the initial question posed \nby the interviewer. To m ention these other possibilities and areas f or further investigation is \ncertainly worthwhile, but it is also im portant not to get too far off track or to com plicate the issue so \nmuch that a final recom mendation is never reached. \n \n \nVIDEO GAMES \n \nPurpose:  To determ ine whether the candidate is able to structure a basic industry analysis. \n \nBACKGROUND  \n \nThe CEO of a large diversified entertainm ent corporation has asked a McKinsey team  to exam ine \nthe operations of a subsidiary of his corporation that m anufactures video gam es. Specifically, he \nneed to know it. he should approve a $200 m illion capital request for tripling the division' s capacity. \n \nQUESTION  \n \nYou are a m ember of the McKinsey team  assigned to this project. Assum e you and I are at the first \ntearn m eeting.  W hat are the critical issues we should plan to exam ine to determ ine if the industry is \nan attractive one for continued investm ent and why?  \n \n  \nPage 64 The following inform ation m ay be given if requested by the candidates though you should focus on \nhaving the candidate identify issues, not obtain m ore inform ation. \n \nMarket share  \nDivision is third largest m anufacturer of hardware in the industry with 10 percent m arket share.  Top \ntwo producers have 40 and 35 percent m arket share. Rem ainder is divided by sm all producers. \nDivision sells to broad range of consum ers. \n \nSales  \n• Division sales have increased rapidly over last year from  a relatively sm all base. Current \nestim ate is \nannual sales of 500,000 units. \n   \n• Current estim ate of industry hardware sales is 5,000,000 units annually. Industry growth has \nbeen strong though over last few m onths, sales growth has slowed.   \n• Divisions current sales price for the basic unit is $45 per unit.  \n• Division rem ains less than 20 percent of parent com pany sales.   \n• Top two com petitors also develop, m anufacture and sell software/gam es though division sells \nonly licensed, software.   \n• Industry growth of software continues to increase. \n \nCosts  \n \n• Division estim ates current cost is $30 fully loaded. Requested expansion should reduce the cost \nby 5 to 7 percent and triple production of the hardware units.   \n• Top two com puters are estim ated to have a 10 to 15 percent cost advantage currently.   \n• Main costs are assem bly com ponents and labor. \n \nCustom ers \n \n• Division estim ates m uch of initial target m arket (young fam ilies) has now purchased the \nvideogam e \nhardware.   \n• No large new user segm ents have been identified. \n \nDistribution  \nPrim arily outlets of distribution are top end electronics stores. \n \nProfitabilitv  \nDivision currently exceeds corporate return requirem ents; however, m argins have recently been \nfalling. \n \nProduct  \n  \nPage 65 Hardware standards have been established by the industry leaders. \nProduct features constantly developed (e.g., new rem ote joy stick), to appeal to m arket segm ents. \n \nNote to the Interviewer  \n \nThe prim ary issue of the case is to determ ine if the industry is attractive and, especially, if our \nclient' s position in that industry is sustainable. The candidate should identifv issues which are \nnecessary for assessing both the industry and our c lient's position, but should not be expected to \nsolve the problem . \n \nIf the candidate begins to discuss too deeply a sp ecific issue, before having covered the key issues \noverall: bring them  back to discuss the Industry m ore broadly by asking \"what other issues m ust be \nexam ined?\" \n \nIf the candidate is discussing issues which seem  irrelevant to the attractiveness of the industry, ask \n\"how will that analysis help to assess the attractiveness of the industry or our client' s position”.   \nThen, ask the candidate to identify other issues which m ust be exam ined. \n \n \nMINIMUM REQUIREMENTS  \n \nThe following issues would need to be covered for the candidate to have done an acceptable job: \n \nl.  What is f uture m arket potential?  Candidate needs to question the continuation of \noverall industry growth.  She/he m ight ask about the saturation of m arkets, \ncompetitive products (hom e com puters), and declining \"per capita\" usage. \n \n2.  What is the com petitive outlook?  Should at least recognize the need to exam ine \ncompetitive dynam ics.  Issue areas m ight included: concentration of m arket shares; \ncontrol of retail channels; and R&D capabilities (rate of new product introductions, \netc.). \n \n3.       What will be the price/volum e relationship in the f uture?   Issues of prices need to be \n  considered. \n \n \nBETTER/OUTSTANDING ANSW ERS \n \nNo bounds on creativity, but better answers would address: \n \nMarket Potential  \n \n• Recognize that there is a relationship between m arket penetration and growth in new users \nwhich, \n  \nPage 66 when com bined, yields an industry volum e estim ate. \n \n• Address the shifting m ix of product purchases, in this case from  hardware (player unit) to \nsoftware \n(video cassettes). \n \n• Seek to look at buyer behavior in key buyer segm ents, i.e., \"fad\" potential of product. \n \nSoftware  \n \n• Recognize technology standards are set by industry leaders.  In this situation, the division as a \nsecondary player will have to follow these standards. \n \n• Recognize that different distribution needs m ay exist for different products (In this case, \nhardware \nversus software). \n \n• Discuss the effect capacity additions can have on overall industry price/volum e relationships and \non \nindustry price levels. \n \nCom pany’s Ability to Com pete \n \n• Should ask what the capacity expansion is designed to do. \n• Explore the cost position of  the client division relative to that of  other com petitors. \n• Seek to understand reason for poor profit perform ance of division \n \n \n \nCONSULTING FIRM (2) \n \nQ: Your client is the treasurer in a significantly privately held corporation. She is in charge of \nmanaging a portfolio of investm ents in addition to her treasury responsibilities. Recently, she has \nasked your advice about the purchase of a large position in com pany 456, whose stock is listed on \nthe NYSE. \n \n Com pany 456 is currently selling for $22 per share. The treasurer' s investm ent analyst \npredicts that the stock will pay a dividend of $1.25 for the foreseeable future.  Short-term  \ntreasury bills are yielding 7 percent, and long-term  t-bills are yielding 8 percent. The \ntreasurer is contem plating the purchase of 5000 shares of com pany 456 and wants your help \nin determ ining a fair m arket price. \n \n  \nPage 67   How would you go about determ ining a fair price for com pany 456?   \n \nAnswer.:  Consulting Firm  (2):   $22 per share",
  "AGSM_STEAM BOILER HOSES": "STEAM BOILER HOSES \n \nProfit Im provem ent \n \nPURPOSE   To determ ine whether the candidate is capable and com fortable with \nconstructing a logical fram ework which will expose opportunities for profit \nimprovem ent. \n \nBACKGROUND  \n \nMcKinsey was asked by a diversified m anufacturing client to help turn around the steam  boiler hose \ndivision.

Drop the product line (apparently not possible because hoses are necessary \nfor boiler sales). \n  2. Raw m aterial prices (they are the sam e as everyone else' s) \n  3. Allocation of  overhead (no cash savings and provides little potential) \n  4. SG&A (standard industry fee paid for independent installers). \n \nBETTER ANSW ERS \n \nBetter answers will m ove beyond the previous answers to consider: \n \n  l. Scale econom ies (client is big enough to achieve scale production). \n  2. Production technology (client has a m odern plant) \n  3. Labor costs (wages rates and productivity are average for the Industry) \n  4. Raw m aterial purchasing practices (m aterial are purchased through long term  \ncontracts with prices based on the spot m arket m inus a discount). \n \n \nOUTSTANDING ANSW ERS \nThe best answers, following a logical progre ssion, should stum ble upon the actual answer: the \nproduct has been over-designed, requiring excess raw m aterial.  The answer should the following \norganizational im plications: \n \n  l. How is our product engineering operation wired into the m arketplace?  (there \nis little contact between the engineering and m arketing/sales organizations) \n \n  2. What kind of feedback are we receivi ng form  our sales force?  (custom ers are \ndelighted with our hoses, but require all the product features) \n \n  3. Are there other areas in the com pany where sim ilar problem s exist? \n \n \n \nPOTS & PANS \n \nA manufacturing com pany based in Charleston, SC m akes high quality pots and pans which are sold \nthroughout the U.S.  in specialty and departm ent stores. You are called in because they feel that the $ \nl million that they spent on distribution last y ear was way too high. How can you show your client \nmoney that he can save m oney. \n \nApproach  \n \nDistribution is basically a trade-off between cost and service level. The higher the service level, the \nhigher the cost (m ore inventory pools, warehouses and shipm ents). So you need to ask where the \n  \nPage 69 inventory is being held. It turns out that stores, since they sell so few of these pots and pans, hold no \ninventory and thus require next-day replenishm ent after a sale. The next thing you need to know is \nwhere the warehouses are located, since the closer they are to the stores the cheaper the distribution \ncosts. Your client has three warehouses - one in Charleston, one in Philadelphia and one in LA - \nfrom  which they cover the whole country.  \n \nA quick way to solve this case is to realize that if stores require next day service from  these three \nwarehouses, the only way they can do this is by shipping overnight at a prem ium rate (UPS - no \nwonder they' re spending so m uch). You can save them  a bunch of m oney by closing down \nPhiladelphia and LA and shipping everything from  the plant In Charleston by UPS (negotiate a \nvolum e rate). This can be confirm ed by asking for the annual sales which turns out to be 10,000 \nunits. W hen you divide this into the $1 m illion distribution cost you discover that they are pay $100 \nto deliver a pan to the store. Beat this figure and you' ve earned your exorbitant fee.",

No \ncompetitor has m ore than 3 percent of  the total m arket \n \nCOST  \nEach product has a different cost to m anufacture dependent on m aterials used and the m anufacturing \nprocess. \n \nPRICE  \nEach product has a different price dependent on both the client' s cost to m anufacture as well as the \nmarket for the product. \n \n \nProducts  \n \n  \nPage 72 Our client' s machinery an produce hundreds of different products. Som e are unique to m eet specific \ncustom er requirem ents while others are used by a wide variety of custom er. \n \nCustom ers \n \nOur client' s custom ers are prim arily consum ers or industrial  product m anufacturers who use the \nsynthetic m aterials in  packaging their own products. \n \nSuppliers  \n \nOur client uses prim arily com modity products in the m anufacturing process.  All can be obtained \nfrom  a num ber of sources. \n \n \nNOTE TO THE INTERVIEW ER \n The prim ary issue of  the case is to determ ine that the prof it of the plant will be m inimized when the \nmost profitable product m ix is product m ix is produced and sold.  The candidate should cover \ndifferences for each product in the fixed and vari able m anufactrnrering and selling cost and prices, \nas those m ust be determ ined to understand each product' s profitability. The interviewee should also \naddress the m arket dem and for each product (to ensure what is produced can be sold at an acceptable \nprice). \n \n If the candidate is discussing issues which are not relevant to the profitability of each product line or \nto maximizing the prof itability of  the plant, repeat the question and ask how the issue being \ndiscussed will lead to a solution f or the client. \n \nMINIMUM REOUIREMENTS  \n \nCandidate should, at a m inimum, address the following issues: \n \nl. Are there m arket lim itations to the potential production of any one m aterial?  \n2. Is there com petition for these products? \n3. Are there differences in costs in the m anufacturing of these m aterials?  For exam ple, do som e \ncoatings cost m ore than others?   Do som e materials have inherent cost differences?  \n4.      Is there flexibility in pricing of these products? \n \n \nAdditional and observations should include: \n \n1. Are there differences in setup tim e and cost for various m aterials or coatings?  \n2. Do these m aterials m ove at different speeds through the m achines?  \n3. Are the m achines truly interchangeable or are som e better suited to one product oranother?  \n4. Is there unlim ited m arket dem and for these products?  \n5. Are there technological displacem ent or replacem ent products on the horizon?  \n  \nPage 73  \n OUTSTANDING ANSW ERS \n \n The best candidates will f ormulate a prof it maximization algorithm .  The best algorithm  is to \nmaximize the profit contribution per m achine hour. \n \n  1. Profit contribution is (unit volum e) tim es (unit price m inus variable cost). \n  2. Machine-hour capacity is a surrogate for fixed costs per unit of volum e. \nFixed costs take into account depreciation and standby costs as well \nas those costs that are independent of the variable costs per pound or \nton produced. \n  \n An outstanding answer m ust include recognition of the asset costs and capital im plied by \nthat, as well as the incom e or profit contribution. Also, the potential substantial differences in \nvolum e produced per m achine-hour and/or the price obtainable in the m arket dem and and \ncompetitive actions.",
  "AGSM_SUPER REGIONAL BANK": "SUPER REGIONAL BANK \n \nYou have a have recently been assigned to a project with one of the nation’s super regional \nbanks.  The bank is one of the top 10 largest retail banks in the country.  Like m ost banks in its \nclass it has branches in 8 geographically contiguous states. \n \nYour client has recently concluded that the old “local branch” way of business is no longer \nviable.  Typically, this bank has canvassed its territory with sm all free-standing branches; \nhowever, the new age of electronic banking and com merce is changing all of that. \n \nThey are considering replacing m any branches w ith Calling Centers.  Calling Centers offer both \nlive and phone autom ated services that m ay be accessed by phone.  The new Centers would offer \nvirtually all of the services currently offered through local branches plus som e additional things. \n \nThe question to you is:  how would you go about setting up the engagem ent to determ ine the \nviability of this new concept?   Specifically, what  kinds of things would you investigate?   and \nwhat hypothesis would you form ?  \n \n \n \nPossible Solution : \n  \nPage 74  \nThis is a very open broad-brushed case.  There certainly is no right answer; however this type of \ncase occurs frequently. The following is a guideline of som e things you should probably \nconsider: \n \nMarket analysis:  W hat kinds of custom ers would be attracted to this no service?   What kinds of \ncustom ers would be turned off?   (Hypothesis:  younger people would be heavier users and m ore \nattracted than older)  Of the people attracted to this new service, how profitable are they?   How \nprofitable are the people who are turned off by this service?   (Hypothesis:  older people have \nmore money and thus are m ore profitable)  \n \nRevenue:  W hat types of  new services could be added to increase revenues?  Autom atic bill \npaym ent, Fund transfer, etc. \n \nCost Savings:  How m uch would it cost to establish a Calling Center and what are the risks \ninvolved?   Do we have the expertise in-house to do this?   How m any branches could we close?   \nCan we cut down on traffic to existing branches - thus requiring less tellers?  \n \nSummary: It probably is best setup as a cost benefit analysis.  The num ber of new custom ers \ntimes the expected revenue from  them  plus the additional revenue generated by potential new \nservices plus the cost savings m ust outweigh the forgone revenue generated by the custom ers \nyou end up driving away. \n \n \nCIGAR BAR \n \nI was sitting in one of Chicago’s new specialty “Cigar Bars” around the end of August with a \nfriend.  It was a Saturday night and the weather wa s fair.  W hile enjoying one of the bar’s finest \nstogies and sipping a cognac, I asked m y friend how m uch he thought the bar was worth. \n \nOn the back of an envelope, how would you go about determ ining the value of this bar?  \n \n \nIssues to consider  \n \nWe arrived at the bar around 8:30pm .  There appeared to be 30 custom ers already there.  By \n11pm  the place had at least 70 custom ers.  I would estim ate the m aximum capacity to be close to \n100. \n \nThe bar sells two things:  liquor and cigars.  The average cost of a cigar is $8 and the average \ncost of a drink is $7. \n \nThere was one bar tender, a waiter and a waitresses.  All three were there the entire evening. \n  \nPage 75  \nThe bar is located on one of Chicago’s trendier streets with a lot of foot traffic. \n \nThe bar is open Tuesday thru Sunday from  5 pm  until 2 am . \n \n \n \nPossible Solution : \n \nThis is a straight forward valuation.  To perform  a valuation you m ust estim ate the cash flows \nfrom  the business and discount them  back using an appropriate weighted average cost of capital \n(WACC). \n \nRevenues:  One way to project revenues is to estim ate the num ber of custom ers per day or per \nweek and m ultiply that by the average expenditure of each custom er.  Keep in m ind that Friday’s \nand Saturday’s are typically busier than other days and that people tend to be out m ore during \nthe Sum mer than in the W inter. \n \nCosts:  There are two com ponents to costs:  fixe d costs and variable costs.  Under fixed costs \nyou m ight consider:  rent, general m aintenance, m anagem ent, insurance, liquor license, and \npossibly em ployees.  The only real variable cost is the cost of goods sold. \n \nValuation:  Subtract the costs from  the revenues and adjust for taxes.  You now have the annual \ncash flows generated from  the bar.  How long do you anticipate this bar being around?   Cigar \nbars are a trend.  In any case pick som e num ber for the expected life (4-5 years).  The discount \nrate should be a rate representative of W ACC’s of sim ilar businesses with the sam e risk.  \nPerhaps 20%.  This gives you a value of: \n \nValue = CF 1/1.2 + CF 2/(1.2)2 + ... + Cf n/(1.2)n",
  "AGSM_NEW MAGAZINE": "NEW MAGAZINE \n \nYour client is the CEO of a publishing com pany that produces a line of educational m agazines as \nwell as a line of wom en’s m agazines.

He has hired you to figure out whether this is possible. \n \nPossible Solution:  \n \nThis is an estim ation case.  The key here is to clearly define your assum ptions, the specific \nanwser is not im portant as long as you are m aking reasonable assum ptions.  For exam ple \n \n  \nPage 76 Target Custom ers \nThe total US population is approxim ately 240 m illion.

  "AGSM_CASTOR MANUFACTURER": "CASTOR MANUFACTURER \n \n \nQ:   Your client m anufactures castors (the wh eels found on the bottom  of office chairs) out of \na plant in W est Germ any and One in East Germ any.  Over the past two years the com pany’s \nprofits have declined by 20% while revenues have been relatively flat.  You have been asked to \nfind out what is happening and suggest a course of action to reverse these trends. \n \nInform ation to be divulged slowly:  \n \nThe com pany operates in three divisions: 50% of sales are to hospital bed m anufacturers, 25% \nare to m op bucket m anufacturers, and 25% are to chair m anufacturers.  The hospital bed and \nmop bucket divisions are located in the W est Germ an m anufacturing operation, the hospital bed \ndivision is located in the East Germ an m anufacturing operation.   \n \n  \nPage 77 Breaking out each division as a separate profit center shows that revenues are up 10% for both \nmop bucket and chair divisions but down 10% for the hospital bed division.  Sim ilarly, profits \nare down 10% for both the m op bucket and chair divisions but are down 30% for the hospital \nbed division.   \n \nFurther investigation shows that labor is the m ajor com ponent of cost in m anufacturing castors.  \nIn the past two years, wages in the form erly state regulated East Germ any have skyrocketed.  \nThis is what is driving m ost of the increased costs.

  "AGSM_LOGGING COMPANY": "LOGGING COMPANY  \n \n \nBackground: \nYou are hired by a Canadian logging com pany to analyze its current operations and provide \nadvice on future operations.  The logging industry in Canada is regulated by the governm ent.  \nLand is leased to individual com panies by the governm ent.  The com pany is m aking a lot of \nmoney and is unsure why.  You have been asked to  determ ine: (1) W hy they are m aking \nmoney?  (2) Is it sustainable?  (3) Is it replicable?   \n \nAdditional Details: \n• Products:  The com pany produces lum ber boards of two sizes 2”x4” and 2”x8”.  Lum ber is a \ncommodity product and as such the com pany is a price-taker in the m arket. \nLeases:  The governm ent leases tracts of land at a annual price that is set to allow for a 12% \nprofit m argin for the entire logging industry.  Thus, all tracts of land have the sam e lease \nprice per acre.  The leases last for 99 years and the original lessee has the right of first \nrenewal on the lease. \n• Profit Structure:  The profit equation for the lum ber industry can be written as:  Profit per \nft^3 = Revenue per ft^3 - Non-land cost per ft^3 - Lease Cost per ft^3 \n  \nPage 78 • Revenues:  There is a revenue advantage for the com pany due to its product m ix.  Margins \nare higher on 2”x8” boards than on 2”x4” boards.  The com pany’s product m ix is m ade up of \n a greater percentage of 2”x8” boards than the “typical” logging com pany percentage. \n• Non-land Costs:  The com pany has a 5% cost  advantage in its ”tree-to-dock” production \nprocess.  There is no significant difference be tween the distribution costs am ong the industry \nfirms. \n• Production Process: The cost advantage is not generated by a better logging process (i.e. \nbetter equipm ent, m ore skilled laborers) but instead exists because of the exceptional quality \nof the trees on the particular piece of land that the com pany leases.  The m ineral content of \nthe land leads to faster growth of healthier trees which im proves both yield and turnover.  \nHealthier trees are straighter and easier to cut, thus reducing costs in each phase of the \nlogging process.  These healthier, taller, straighter trees yield m ore 2”x8” board-feet than is \ntypical and leads to the advantaged product m ix.  There are no significant econom ies of scale \nto the process. \n \nKey Points \n• The com pany leases land with a signif icantly higher quality of  trees. This leads to a revenue \nadvantage because m ore 2”x8” board-feet can be produced per acre of land.  Additionally, \nthere is a cost advantage because the higher quality inputs m ake the logging process easier \nand increase yields and turnover. \n• Since the leases are for 99 years and renewable, the current situation seem s sustainable. \n• Since it is unlikely that another piece of land sim ilar to this one exists or that another firm  \nwill give up advantaged land, the situation is not replicable.",
  "AGSM_INFORMATION SERVICES COMPANY": "INFORMATION SERVICES COMPANY  \nBackground: \nYou are hired by a library inform ation services com pany that provides a com puterized article \nsearch product on CD-ROM.

The product has different versions that are upgraded each year.  Each version is \nmarketed to a specific library segm ent.  Libraries are interested in m atching the article search \nto hardboard volum es available within the library.  The client’s product is considered to have \nthe highest quality of  article search. \n• Pricing:  The client sells its product at a 25% discount to the m ajor com petitor and has the \nlowest prices in the industry.  The pricing and profit schedule for each version are shown \nbelow. \nLibrary Client Price Client Profit per \nUnit Major Com petitor \nPrice \nAcadem ic $2000 >$500 $2667 \nPublic $1500 $500 $2000 \nSecondary School $1000 $100 $1333 \n• Com petitive Features:  Com petition within the industry focuses on four dim ensions: (1) \nSearch Quality, (2) Content, (3) Ease of Use, and (4) Price.  The table above indicates the \nrelative preference for these features for each m arket segm ent.  There is a trade-off between \nease of  use and search quality.  A better search requires a m ore skilled approach to keyword \nusage and often m akes the search m ore difficult.  The client’s product is considered to have \nthe highest quality search am ong the com petitors. \n• Production:  the product is created by program mers who seek to m atch the product to library \nvolum es.  Since the principal input is labor, the type of CD-ROM created can be altered \nrelatively easily. \n \nKey Points \n• The client’s product does not m atch the needs of the large segm ents of the m arket (i.e. the \nclient’s high quality of search only appeals to a sm all segm ent of the total m arket) ==> weak \nmarket share \n• The client should reallocate its resources to create products in the larger m arket segm ents -- \nproducts that em phasize content and ease of use over search quality. \nThe m ost profitable segm ent can be identified by using current client prices which should allow \nit to gain m arket share (due to the 25% discount to the m ajor com petitor) and calculating the \nmaximum market profit.  Academ ic = 5000 x 500= $2.5M; Public = 10000 x 500 = $5.0M; \nSecondary = 20000 x 100 = $2.0M.  Therefore, if we realign our product to em phasize ease of \nuse and content, the potential profit is 4500 x 500 + 10000 x 500 = 7.25M ( m inimum since \nprofit in academ ic segm ent is > $500 per unit). \n \n  \nPage 80",
  "AGSM_PIPELINE COMPANY": "PIPELINE COMPANY \n \n \nCase Type:  Industry Analysis \n \nBackground: \nYou are hired by a large pipeline com pany to evaluate the current and future potential of the \npipeline industry.  The pipeline industry sprang up as transportation costs for m ineral extraction \ncompanies began to escalate.  There is currently 20,000 m iles of pipeline throughout the U.S.  \nWhat inform ation would you want to know about th e pipeline industry that could help you plot a \nstrategy for a pipeline com pany?  \n \nAdditional Details: \n• Industry Structure:  There are m any pipeline com petitors.  Pipeline can be characterized as \neither com mon carrier pipelines (~70% of all pipeline m iles) which are regulated by the \ngovernm ent and proprietary pipelines (~30% of all pipeline m iles) which are wholly located \non the private property of a firm  (e.g. a pipeline from  a port station to a near-shore refinery).  \nThere are m any suppliers of com mon carrier pipelines.  The second group (proprietary) is not \nregulated by the governm ent. \n• Products:  The pipelines carry liquid and gaseous m aterials -- crude oil, natural gas, m ethane \ngas, liquid nitrogen, refined oil products (gasoline), and chem icals. \n• Cost Structure:  There are exceptionally high fixe d costs involved in a pipeline.  The variable \ncosts are prim arily the electricity to power pum ping stations along the pipeline.  There are \ndifferent cost structures depending on the type  of product being m oved.  Pum ping crude oil \nalong the pipeline can cost as m uch as $2M/m onth in electricity for a station.  Gaseous \nproducts require considerably less energy to m ove. \n• Market Conditions:  U.S. proven reserves are dim inishing and foreign im ports are increasing. \n It is expected that for the next 5-10 years dem and will be steady. \n \nKey Points: (classic Porter analysis could be used -- This is rarely the case!!!) \n• Threat of Entry  is low because ... \n- there are high f ixed costs (high initial investm ent) \n- pipeline services are essentially a com modity product (com modity m arkets are slow growth and \nunattractive) \n• Industry Rivalry  is strong because ... \n- there are m any com petitors and switching costs are low \n- industry growth is expected to be slow (i.e. m arket share is im portant) \n- many com petitors use pipeline for in-house uses and only carry other products if capacity is \nunderutilized \n- there are very high exit barriers (i.e. there is a strategic relationship between refining and \npiping) \n• Substitute Products  are m any as witnessed ... \n- by proliferation of tanker cars and tractor trailer rigs for liquid and gaseous m aterials \n  \nPage 81 • Power of Suppliers  is not a significant factor. \nPower of Buyers  is not a significant factor because m any pipelines are regulated and there are \nmany buyers \n• Other considerations: \n- Product Mix:  The m argins on gaseous products is higher than heavy unrefined products. \n- Governm ent Regulation:  Margins are greatly affected by com mon carrier status.  Any future \nenvironm ental   regulations will cut even deeper into m argins. \n- Pipeline as a storage m edium :  For m any firm s the product in a pipeline can be a significant \nportion of its  inventory and the volum e in line m ust be considered in production.  The \nclassic question:  Is it better to  make product and sell it now at low prices or wait for \nprices to increase (e.g. crude oil prices)?   A large  pipeline could be a tem porary \nstorage f acility. \n- Operations:  Maxim izing profit m eans understanding the param eters of pum ping -- costs of \npumping at less  than full capacity; layout of pipeline and pum ping stations; products \nwhich can share the sam e pipeline;  construction of parallel pipelines. \n Market Differences:  The m arket for crude oil is very different than the m arket for specialty \nchem icals or  natural gas.  the pipeline m anager m ust aware of these rapidly changing \ncommodity m arkets to  maximize his profit \n",
  "AGSM_AUTO MANUFACTURER": "AUTO MANUFACTURER \n \nBackground: \nYour team  is hired by a large U.S. autom obile m anufacturer (GM).  They are interested in your \nevaluation of their $10B after-m arket parts business.  This business can be segm ented into two \nsets of buyers: dealers authorized to sell GM parts ($8B) and non-dealer m erchandisers ($2B).  \nThis second group can be subdivided into m ass merchandisers and “service” providers.  Mass \nmerchandisers are of two types -- those which specialize in auto parts (e.g. Auto Zone) and those \nwhich sell diverse products including auto parts (e.g. Sears).  “Service” providers include \nGoodyear or W estern Auto.  GM would like for you to answer two questions: (1) Is there an \nopportunity to expand this part of the business?  (2) How would they go about doing it if they \nchose to expand?  \n \nAdditional Details: \n• Com pany Econom ics:  There are trem endous fixed costs in the auto business (including \nlabor).  All of  GM’s parts m anufacturing f acilities are f ully depreciated and they currently \nhave excess capacity. \n• Com petitors:  W hile Ford and Chrysler m ake parts f or their own cars, they are not nearly as \nintegrated as GM and tend to focus in specific parts categories.  There are hundreds of sm all \nparts m anufacturers which tend to focus on com modity-like auto parts (e.g. oil filters). \n• Products:  GM produces a full spectrum  of parts classified as either platform-specific or \nuniversal .  \n  \nPage 82  Platform -specific Parts Universal Parts \nTypes of Parts Body panels , brakes , transm issions , Spark plugs, filters , hoses , engines batteries \nMarket \nCharacteristics Sold through dealers under \nwarranty; high m argins/low volum e Sold through m any outlets; \nhigh turnover; strong \ncompetition; slim  margins/very \nhigh volum e \nGM Sales $8B $2B \n• Growth Rates:  The table below provides the basic facts about each m arket segm ent’s growth \nrate. \nMarket Segm ent Overall Market Growth \nRate Total Market Size \nDealer-authorized -35% per annum  $40B \nNon-dealer   \n• Mass \nmerchandisers +65% per annum  $70B \n• Service \nproviders +15% per annum  $30B \n \nKey Points: (Porter Five Forces analysis) \n• Threat of Entry is m inimal for a broad category because the fixed costs are very high.  \nHowever, a m anufacturer could go after a niche play if it were to develop an advantaged cost \nstructure or superior product.  Switching costs am ong consum ers is very low. \n• Industry Rivalry is im portant for the m ass merchandiser category because m argins are slim  \n(meaning price wars are m ore prevalent).  Brand nam es (e.g. Fram , AC Delco, AutoLite) are \nimportant to m any consum ers. \n• Substitute Products are relevant only in the sense that there are m any com peting products and \nfuture technologies such as electric cars could elim inate the need for m any types of parts. \n• Power of Suppliers is not a significant factor because inputs are com modity raw m etal and \nrubber. \n• Power of Buyers is im portant since there are few m ass merchandisers such as Sears or Km art \nand they dem and  full range of products and trem endous volum e discounts. \nGM’s Position:  GM m ay have a cost advantage due to its fully depreciated plants and excess \ncapacity in a fixed-cost environm ent.  Thus its variable costs m ust be below sales revenue.  Also, \nits brand nam es are respected and are valuable to m erchandisers in m aintaining m argins.  GM’s \nability to produce a full-range of products is also an advantage.  These advantages com bined \nwith the high growth rates for the non-dealer m erchandisers should m otivate GM to expand it \nbusiness in this segm ent.. GM should use its cost advantage, brand nam es, and full range of \nproducts to go after the m ost lucrative m arket -- the m ass merchandisers.",
  "AGSM_DELI MEAT PRODUCER": "DELI MEAT PRODUCER \n \nBackground: \n  \nPage 83 You have been hired by a producer of deli m eats to investigate the cause of its recent decline in \nmarket share.

The m arket  share loss is prim arily in the prem ium \ncategory.  The deli m eats carry a well-known brand label. \n- Price:  Products in the prem ium category carry a higher price and have slightly higher m argins. \n Although  price decreases will garner m arket share, the com petitors have m aintained prices \nduring the recent loss  in market share. \n-Place (Distribution):  The product is sold in grocery stores and delis.  Com pany investigation \nhas shown that  grocers have m aintained the sam e amount of shelf facings and space for \nyour product (so the decrease  in share was not caused by changes in display or incentives \nprovided to the grocers by com petitors). \n- Prom otion:  Advertising and m arketing efforts have been steady during this period of decline \nand there has  been no noticeable change in the com petition’s efforts. \n• The Com petition:  There are three other com petitors in the deli m eat industry.  Each of these \ncompetitors has about 20% of the m arket share; the client has 40% of the m arket share.  \nOverall the m arket (generic, m idrange and prem ium) is growing.  The com petition uses the \nsame channels to sell its products. \n• The Custom er:  Although the custom er buying prem ium deli m eats has not changed, a survey \nof the custom ers indicated a variability in the quality of the product produced by the client.  \nSometimes the product was better than the com petition; som etimes not.  This was causing \ncustom ers to change to the com petition. \n \nSolution: \n• Production Process:  The client receives chunk m eat in bins which m eet a certain average \nquality m easurem ent.  Meat is rated on a scale of 1 to 100 (100 being best).  The client is in a \nlong-term  contract with a supplier for bins at three quality ratings: 40, 70, and 90.  Individual \nchunks within a bin m ay vary from  this average.  The prem ium deli m eats are m ade from  a \nmix of the three bins with the m ajority com ing from  the 90-rated bin.  Meat in the 90-rated \nbin ranges from  80-95 while m eat in the 70-rated bin ranges from  55-80.  The variability in \nthe quality of the prem ium product is being driven by the variability within a 90-rated bin. \n• To reduce the variability, the client could (1) negotiate with the supplier to narrow the range \nwithin a bin or (2) sort the m eat within the 90 -rated bin at his own f acility.  The im pact of  the \nfirst proposal will depend on the relationship with the supplier.  That is, is the client a m ajor \nbuyer; how m uch longer is the contract set to run.?   The second option will add cost to the \nproduction process and reduce m argins. \n \n  \nPage 84",

Their plot in Ohio is in need of refurbishing.  The com pany has four \npossible options: \n \n  I. Refurbish the existing plant \n  2. Build a larger plant at the current location \n  3. Build a sim ilar size plant at a new location \n  4. Build a larger plant at a new location \n \nWhich is the best option for this plant?  \n \nAnswer  \n \nThere are two issues to this decision. The plant size and the plant location should be considered \nseparately. \n \nl. Size of Plant \n \nFirst consideration is the demand for the product. Corn feed is a com modity product. Pricing on the \nproduct is dependent on current corn prices as opposed to the m anufacturing process.  There are four \nmain com petitors - our com pany is the second largest.  All four com petitors have sim ilar \nmanufacturing processes and sim ilar cost structure.  The purposed largest plant will not have \neconom ies of scales not currently present a the existing plant. The capacity utilization is 65% which \nis industry standard. The current custom ers buy from  all four m anufacturers in order to guarantee \nsupply. Currently dem and is being m et and there are no alternative use for corn feed. \n \n2. Location of Plant \n \nTransportation cost and perishability are the m ain issues with location. The transportation cost for \nthe corn stock (raw m aterial) is m uch higher than the cost of transporting the actual feed. The corn is \ngrown in the Ohio area and the feed is sold to the East Coast. The raw m aterial is perishable where \nas the corn feed can be stored for any length of tim e and easier to transport.  Cost analysis of the \ntransportation cost of feed versus raw m aterials should be com pleted. Included in this analysis would \nbe the % of spoilage for longer transportation of corn stock \n \nConclusion  \n  \nPage 61  \nThe current plant is located close to the corn fields and this is the best location for the plant from  the \ncost/benefit analysis.",

Why?\nExhibit & Question Guidance:\nAfter looking at exhibit 1, candidates should be able to identify and call out the following:\n• The most attractive markets have 1. high production overlap, 2. large market sizes, 3. high growth, and 4. higher number of competitors (fragmented market)\n• Call outs:\n- Most attractive: Bullet Proof Vests –Why? 1. High production overlap, 2. Second largest market size, 3. Double digit growth, 4. Fragmented market for\neasier penetration\n- Least Attractive: Police Badges –Why? 1. Low production overlap, 2. Smallest market 3. Low growth, 4. Highly concentrated market\n- Bonus call outs:\n• Uniforms look interesting because of its large size and overlap, but the high concentration of competitors makes for a difficult market entry\n• Body Cameras look interesting due to the high growth and market fragmentation, but this should be avoided because it is out of Fire Proof’s area of\nexpertise (as illustrated from the low overlap)\n• Riot Shields are a close second place to bullet proof vests because although it has a faster growth rate, it also has fewer competitors (more\nconcentrated market)\n• Once the candidate identifies that bullet proof vests is the most attractive market, move on to question 2.\n\n04 | CASE: F IRE PROOF\nQuestion 2:\nOur team has done some internal analysis and have identified that Fire Proof can realistically capture 30% of the bullet proof vest market in 3\nyears.

(No right or wrong answers). Expected answers: Yes, because it is\nvery close and the company needs to diversify (main priority); No, because there may be other markets we haven’t explored yet that can allow them to hit their goals.\n\n04 | CASE: F IRE PROOF\nBRAI NS TORM I NG\nBeyond just the police department, what are other markets and/or products that Fire Proof can consider to diversify their revenue\nstream?\nBrainstorming Guidance:\nNote: This is just one possible set of categories and answers.

This is where you insert question and the answers to the question\n• Good Response: Candidate should realize that there is a negative correlation – the more copiers in the contract, the\nlower per copier bid price (price wars for more contribution). A candidate should hypothesize why that may be so –\nperhaps the salespeople may be lowering bid price in effort to increase commission (due to higher sales from larger\nquantity contracts) or looking to increase overall profit while overall margins are smaller.\n• Great response: Candidate should point out that there are a few contracts with high bid prices.

Generic\nframeworks are inappropriate.\n\n12 | CASE: RUBBER BUMPER\nE X HI BI T 1\nRubber bands sold each year (millions of pounds of rubber)\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\nRubber Bumper 43 32.52.52.52\nMax Rubber 17 19 21 21 22 23 24\nOthers (8) 99 87.56.54.55\nTotal 30 31 32 31 31 30 31\nCondoms sold each year (millions of condoms)\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\nRubber Bumper 12 5 10 10 10 10\nSpartan 100 110 108 115 117 115 115\nDurable 150 155 152 158 159 165 170\nOthers (15) 99 93 105 107 119 130 155\nTotal 350 360 370 390 405 420 450\n\n12 | CASE: RUBBER BUMPER\nExhibit Guidance:\nThe interviewee should notice and verbally acknowledge the following in Exhibit 1. This is where you insert question and the answers to the question\nQuestion 1: The team decided to look at the product mix and their industry wide positions. The company only has two\nproducts: rubber bands and condoms. The analysts on our team compiled these two tables. (Display Ex. 1). What does this\ntell you?\nHow to Move Forward:\nExpected Insights:\n1.The rubber band market is flat whereas the condom market is showing strong growth in the United States\n2.The dominant player in the rubber band industry is gaining more and more market share\n3.While the condom industry is growing (30% from 2005 to 2011) the major competitors are not growing as fast (~15% each).\n4.The condom industry is more fragmented than the rubber band industry, and the smaller players are getting a larger proportion of the market\nCommentary:\nThe candidate should ultimately start to see that the rubber band industry is becoming less attractive and the condom\nindustry is showing growth and the major market players are not keeping up with the growth. A great response will\nautomatically want to see why Rubber Bumper’s condom growth has tapered off while the industry keeps expanding. If they\ndo not get to that issue, prod them until they do.\n\n12 | CASE: RUBBER BUMPER\nQuestion 2: Rubber Bumper Co has two factories, each producing one of their two products. They essentially do not share\nany fixed costs and for the most part are run as separate P&L’s. The team would like you to put together a quick summary\nand compare the financial profitability of each of the two factories for the most recent year.\nRubber Band Factory\n• They make boxes of 500 rubber bands that they sell to retailers for $20 a box\n• 1 pound of rubber makes approximately 125 rubber bands\n• They should already have the amount of rubber they used from the exhibit\n• The rubber band factory has an inclusive $4MM in annual overhead\n• [ONLY PROVIDE WHEN ASKED] It costs $1 to turn a pound of rubber into a pound of rubber bands (assume no\nwaste)\nCondom Factory\n• They sell 4 packs of condoms to retailers for $3 a pack\n• They factory is smaller than the rubber band factory and only costs $2 MM in annual overhead, inclusive of everything\n• [ONLY PROVIDE WHEN ASKED] Each condom costs $0.10 to make\n\n12 | CASE: RUBBER BUMPER\nExpected Calculations: (Question 2)\nStudents may get tripped up because one starts with the number of condoms, and the other starts with the amount of pure\nrubber and need to infer the number of bands sold. (rb = rubber band):\n• 2MM lbs of rubber x 125rb’s/lb = 250 MM rb’s\n• 250MM rb’s / 500 rbs/box = 500K boxes x $20 box = $10MM in Revenue\n• 2MM lbs of rubber x $1 = $2MM in variable costs\n• RB Profit = $10 - $2 - $4 = $4MM in profit\n• 10 MM condoms / 4 pack = 2.5 MM packs x $3 = $7.5MM in Revenue\n• 10MM condoms x $0.10 = $1MM in variable costs\n• Condom Profit = 7.5 – 1 – 2 = 4.5MM in profit\nCommentary: A good answer will arrive at the math and note that the two profits are fairly comparable. A great answer will\nalso note that the margin on the condoms is significantly higher (4.5 MM in profit for 3 MM in costs, rather than 4MM in\nprofit for 6 MM in costs). Also, a great answer will question why the overhead for the condom factory is small compared with\nthe rubber band.\n\n12 | CASE: RUBBER BUMPER\nQuestion 3: It turns out that the two overhead figures are significantly different because the capacity of the second factory\nis much smaller, about half as much. The President has asked us to evaluate whether we should switch production of the\nfirst plant to make more condoms since we have reached capacity at the smaller plant (assume a factory can only make 1\nthing).\nSupplementary Information\nGive out the following information ONLY WHEN REQUESTED.\n• It will cost $2MM dollars to refurbish the new plant and take 1 year to complete during which time the factory will be off\nline. (If asked, assume there are no tax benefits from depreciating the CapEx and no cost of capital)\n• Overhead would remain the same\n• During this time, we won’t be able to make any rubber bands\n• The bigger plant can produce twice the volume of condoms as the smaller plant.\n• Rubber Bumper Co’s payback period for such projects is 4 years.\n• Assume that Rubber Bumpers rubber band demand has stabilized at 2MM lbs per year.\n\n12 | CASE: RUBBER BUMPER\nExpected Calculations: (Question 3)\nA bad answer will simply look at 4.5MM in profit and 4.0MM and say that Rubber Bumper should make more condoms. A\ngreat answer will look into the costs, the opportunity costs, and the payback period to evaluate whether this should go\nforward. Also a great interviewee will recognize the timing of the payments, and while we don’t have a cost of capital there\nis a timeline such investments must prove profitable.\n• 1 year offline they are losing (10MM – 2MM ) = $8MM in contribution\n• Capital Expenditures = $2MM\n• Total Cost of Project = 8 + 2 = $10MM\nNote we assume that overhead will be paid while the factory is offline, but it should not count as an additional cost, since we would pay that\nanyways.\n• The benefit is the difference in profitability between the two products.\n• The bigger factory can produce twice as many condoms; 6.5MM x 2 = 13MM\n• The bigger factory is currently producing 8MM in contribution (because we are looking for the difference, the $4MM of overhead is a\nwash)\n• Switching will create an additional $13 – 8 = 5MM in profit.\n• The interviewee should draw a conclusion towards the end noting that under these assumptions the project will repay itself in year 3 (1\nyear offline + 2 years of operation) and that it is within the required time frame. Additional second level insights are encouraged.\n\n12 | CASE: RUBBER BUMPER\nBRAI NS TORM\nWhat are some of the risks involved with this project?\nBrainstorming Guidance\nThis is a “what else” section. Below are some basics but ideally you’re looking for the interviewee to be as creative as\npossible. As with most questions of this type, a bad answer will stop at one or two. A good answer will have a creative list. A\ngreat answer will have a structure that makes the answer MECE. A great answer should also prioritize the findings indicating\nwhich ones he thinks are the most important.\nKey Points to Consider\n• Assumes that Rubber Bumper can sell 3x the number of condoms it sells today, immediately.\n• Assumes that rubber band demand wont rebound. The bigger plant is equally profitable because it is being underutilized\n• Political parties could kill sex ed.\n• Less diversification in products exposes them to increased market risk\n• Condoms are not as generic of a product as rubber bands and may require a larger investment in advertising to compete on a higher level\n• Potentially more legal risk in selling contraception than rubber bands\n• Employees may not want to make condoms.\n\n12 | CASE: RUBBER BUMPER\nCONCLUS I ON\nThe President is walking in the board room and expects a summary. Please summarize your findings.\nExpected Analysis\nThe summary should start with a recommendation. “You should convert the plant” and then back track into the\nreasoning: industry trends and financial justification. Finally it should mention which of the risks are the most\nproblematic and how he would mitigate it. The interviewer should feel free to challenge any part of the\nconclusion and expect a well worded response.",

These are low cost,\nlow margin products with end-use in multiple industries.\n– Specialty products are highly customized products, processed in small batches. These are\nmade to order based on specific customization instructions of the clients and hence, they are\ntypically high cost, high margin products.\n• If asked, clarify that ChemCo sells its products through “direct sales” approach where\nsales representatives do site visits to all their clients to share information about\nChemCo’s products, understand the client’s requirements, and record orders.\nChemical Imbalance\nInterviewer Guidance:\n• The interviewee should recognize that at its core, this is profitability problem:\nRevenue-Costs framework and External Factors. They should detail each “bucket”.\nFor example, Sales: Volume x Price. Costs: Raw materials, Labor, Sales, etc.\nExternal Factors: Industry is declining, Poor economic conditions, Regulatory\nrestrictions/ fees increasing etc.\n• If asked, say that sales are growing in line with industry and ChemCo is the market\nleader in sales, but its margins are lagging the industry.\n• Provide Exhibit # 1 if asked about comparative analysis of cost vs. competitors.

Given the cost of servicing all the\ncustomers is similar, there is an opportunity\nto optimize sales cost here.\nChemical Imbalance\nPrompt #4:\n• Once the candidate delivers the key insight from Exhibit # 2, ask them to brainstorm\nsome potential ways to reduce the cost of serving consumer goods manufacturers.\nInterviewer Guidance:\n• Some of the potential ways to optimize the cost of serving the consumer goods\nmanufacturers:\n– Sales through distributors\n– Changing internal sales model (use indirect sales model)\n• E-commerce (sale through website/ app)\n• Sales through mailed paper catalogues\n• Sales through in-house call center (remote sales)\nPrompt #5:\nThe CEO of ChemCo is about to walk-in. What is your recommendation to him?\nChemical Imbalance\nRecommendation\n• Recommendation: I recommend that ChemCo should adopt indirect sales or sale\nthrough distributors to service consumer goods manufacturers (for Commodity\nproducts).\n• Result: This will result in optimization of salesforce headcount and associated Sales\ncost, which is currently much higher than competitors.\n• Justification: Direct sales approach is expensive and consumer goods manufacturers\ndo not yield enough revenue to justify the cost of direct sales approach.\n• Risks/ Challenges: Customer concerns for quality of service, Employee backlash due\nto headcount reduction, Building new capabilities/ relationships with dealers, etc.\n• Next step: Get more data on costs of direct and indirect sales approach, estimate\ncosts for introducing recommended mode to determine cost savings\nInterviewer Guidance:\n• There is room for optimizing the sales model for servicing the consumer goods\nmanufacturers. The recommendation is designed to be somewhat flexible as long as\nthe interviewee suggests selling through distributors or changing internal sales\nmodel for these customers backed by sound reasoning, that should be considered\nas a valid recommendation.\n• An exceptional candidate will note that specialty products require more customer inputs\nand hence, recommend distributor/ indirect sales approach for commodity products only.",

  "Duke_Fuqua_2018_2019_Going Green": "Going Green\nIndustry: Market Entry\nQuantitative Level: Medium\nQualitative Level: Medium\nCase 10: Going Green\nPrompt\nOver the last few years some states have legalized medical marijuana sales on a prescription basis, and some have even legalizedrecreational use.\nThe cultivation and sales of marijuana most often take place in small storefronts called dispensaries. In most states, limitshave been created on\nhow many dispensaries are allowed to exist at any one time.\nYour client, North Carolina Tobacco Company, made $8 Billion in revenue and $2 Billion in profits last year, but has seen declining use of cigarettes\nin the United States, which currently makes up 25% of its total revenue and profit. NC Tobacco is considering moving into therecreational\nmarijuana market. What should they do? Assume that federal regulations are not a concern in this case.\nInterviewer Guidance\nProvide if requested:\n• Global use of tobacco has not declined and is even increasing in some areas\n• NC Tobacco is interested in diversifying their portfolio of products\n• NC Tobacco is normally focused on long-term profitability, but because this is a very new market they aren’t completely sure what else they\nshould be thinking about.\n• NC Tobacco only interested in entering the recreational market, as medical marijuana is highly regulated and requires the dispensary to be a not\nfor profit organization. (Assume recreational dispensaries are for-profit)\nA good candidate will recognize that this is a market entry question. The framework can include:\n• Market Evaluation: Market Size, barriers to entry,\n• Entry: Buy, Build, Partner\n• Economics: Costs, Revenue, synergies with cigarette business, NPV\n• Risks: Political fallout in NC (tobacco centric state), Negative PR for getting in drug business, potential substitution of cigarettesales, consumer\ndistaste for ‘big corporate’, problems with financing (banks don’t want to finance due to risks associated with Marijuana). 149\nCase 10: Going Green\nPrompt\nNC Tobacco is interested in Washington and Colorado, which are two states that have legalized recreational use of marijuana. What is\nthe potential market size in Washington and Colorado?\nInterviewer Guidance\nGuide the candidate toward a top-down approach. Provide the following information if requested:\n• Colorado Population: 5 Million\n• Colorado Population that smokes: 15%\n• Washington Population: 7 Million\n• Washington Population that smokes: 10%\n• Number of grams consumed per week: 1\n• Price per gram (assume this is the equivalent of 1 marijuana cigarette): $15\nCandidate should lay out information requested on an organized chart or data table.\nAnalysis\nWashington Market size: $15/gram * 50 grams/yr * 7M people * 10% = $525 M\nColorado Market Size: $15/gram *50 grams/yr * 5M people * 15% = $562.5 M\nCandidate should note a fairly large market size relative to current NC Tobacco profits, and a relatively larger market size in Colorado.\nCase 10: Going Green\nPrompt\nNow that NC Tobacco understands the market size, how should they enter the market?\nInterviewer Guidance\nThe candidate should analyze the cost/benefits for buy, build or partner. Guide them to the primary analysis of buy or build,ifthey\ndon’t arrive there quickly. If candidate inquires about JV, assume NC Tobacco wants full control of the process. The candidate should\napproach this in a structured way that analyzes the positives and negatives of each. Utilizing a table is one way to facilitate this:\nAnalysis\nStrategy Buy Build\nBenefits • Quick toramp up and capitalize on first mover advantage • Easier to build culture\n• Utilize local expertise • Fewconsolidated competitors means less competition\n• Few states have marijuana cigarettes so easy to consolidate • Similar products may allow ease of entrance into market\n• Utilize local brand recognition\nDisadvantages • Integrationinto new company • Limitedlicenses distributed restrict ability to build from scratch\n• Scattered, independent operators may make consolidation • Timeto grow plants, establish brand name and sell may take too\nchallenging long –other competitors may enter\n• Financing may be challenging for marijuana dispensary\npurchases\nRecommendation\nCandidate should recall limited amount of licenses distributed and recognize that building would be more difficult. Client should buy\nrather than build.\nCase 10: Going Green\nPrompt\nNC Tobacco is interested in purchasing a portion of the dispensaries currently in the market. What do they need to know in orderto\ndetermine the worthiness of the investment, and which market they should enter, if any?\nInterviewer Guidance\nPotential avenues of pursuit could be an ROI, a Breakeven, or an NPV analysis. Guide the candidate towards an NPV analysis and a\ndetermination of the value of the purchases to NC Tobacco. Once they have asked for financial information, provide Exhibit 1.\nThe first step of this analysis is to determine the revenue for each individual dispensary. Candidate should recognize that theyrequire\nthe number of individual dispensaries in each state. See below for information –individual revenue numbers are on interviewer copy\nof Exhibit 1.\n• Total number of dispensaries in Colorado: 100\n• Total number of dispensaries in Washington: 200\nOne they calculate the individual revenue, the candidate should begin pursuing an NPV valuation with the data at hand.

An excellent candidate will realize that both are viable\noptions due to the positive NPV..\nCase 10: Going Green\nPrompt\nShould NC Tobacco move forward with purchasing dispensaries? What are some other factors that NC Tobacco might want to consider\nbefore moving forward with their decision?\nInterviewer Guidance\nCandidate should provide a conclusion slide clearly identifying the recommendation, along with the risks associated with the strategy.\nRecommended action would be to move forward with purchase of both Colorado and Washington dispensaries due to NPV, but the\ncandidate can make a case for either moving forward or for not purchasing as long as sufficient support is provided. This is a good\nopportunity to push the candidate with ‘what else’ questions, particularly during the risk assessment.\nCase 10: Going Green\nAnalysis\nPotential Rationale for moving forward with purchase:\n• Positive NPV\n• Higher profit margin than cigarettes\n• First mover advantage\n• Potential high-growth market as more states legalize\n• Synergistic opportunities in supply chain, marketing, etc.\n• New (and highly loyal) customer base\n• Cigarettes inviable for long term\nPotential Rationale for not continuing:\n• NPV small for company making $8 Billion/yr in revenue\n• Potential variability in projected vs. actual income statement estimates\n• Potentially low estimate of purchase price (given low NPV/store)\n• Potential first mover disadvantage\n• Negative PR for getting in ‘drug’ business\n• Potential substitution of cigarette sales\n• Potential consumer distaste for ‘big business’\n• Problems with financing (banks don’t want to finance due to risks associated with Marijuana)\n• Cigarette sales still strong abroad –focus on international opportunities\nCase 10: Going Green\nPerformance Evaluation\n• Thiscase tests the candidate’s ability to:\nWork through complicated math\no\nDevelop structured approaches to problems\no\nRecall key facts discussed earlier in the case\no\nUnderstand key factors that drive market entry and M&A cases\no\nMake a recommendation in the face of ambiguous information\no\nRemain professional in a business case that may otherwise encourage individuals to lose their professionalism\no\n• Good interviewees will:\nWill have an understanding where the case is going throughout\no\nHave 1-2 math errors but recovers appropriately\no\nDisplays good ability to utilize public math\no\nCreates basic MECE structure (bucketed approach, etc.) to analyze problems\no\nProvides conclusion with support\no\nProvides a recommendation after analysis with 3-4 potential risk factors\no\nMaintains professional composure throughout\no\n• Exceptional interviewees will\nDrive the case forward throughout with hypothesis based inquiry\no\nHave 0 math errors\no\nWill maintain composure throughout the math\no\nAdd creative ideas to qualitative analysis\no\nAddresses prompts with advanced matrices or analytical structures that show depth of thinking and organization\no\nIs engaging, displays interest in the subject and has appropriate body posture and presence\no\nProvides a strong, efficient, concise recommendation with at least 4-5 risk factors.\no",

To\nbolster their presence in the Pacific Northwest, they are in talks with Drug Corp to\npurchase retail assets in the region. Though the acquisition seems sound, the RX Co\nCEO wants to be sure that the transaction will help them achieve growth.\n- Can you help the company evaluate the deal?\nInterviewer Guidance:\n- Candidate should quickly try to specify and quantify the specific goal of the\nacquisition - growth. If asked (and only if asked), RX Co aims to grow annual\nrevenue by 20% from current levels. They want this to happen the first year after\nthe acquisition is complete. Assume the acquisition can be completed and the assets\noperational in one year.\n- When evaluating the framework, make sure the candidate understands this is a\nrevenue case - and steer them away from costs.\n- Try to push the candidate to explore the sources of revenue for pharmacy retailers,\nnamely RX and Front of House Merchandise.\nExhibit #1\nFront-of-House Overall\nPharmacy Total US\nMerchandise Revenue /\nRevenue % Stores\nRevenue % Day\nRX Co. $11,000 8,400\n70% 30%\nDrug Corp $7,800 2,400\nInterviewer guidance on Exhibits\nExhibit #1 Guidance:\n- The candidate may try to calculate the daily pharmaceutical revenue for RX Co by\nmultiplying 0.7*$11,000*8,400. If they do, remind them that we are only interested in\nstores in the NW Region. Rx Co has 5,000 in the region, and Drugs has 900.\n- If asked, the candidate can assume stores in the NW region have the same revenue makeup and\naverage overall revenue as stores nationwide\n- RX Co current pharma rev is 0.7*$11,000/day*365 days/year*5000 NW stores = ~$14B.\nGrowth target is $14B * 1.15 = ~$16.1B\n- Pharma rev to be added from acquisition is 0.7*$7,800/day*365 days/year*900 NW stores\n= ~$1.8B\n- Candidate should clearly conclude that the acquisition will not help RX Co achieve their\nrevenue growth targets the next year.\n- A strong candidate could calculate the exact number of Drug Corp stores that would need\nto be purchased to achieve the proper targets\n- It is OK to round to the nearest hundred million.\nDrugs “R” Us\nPrompt #2:\n- What else should else should be considered when evaluating / calculating the\nadditional revenue that RX Co can achieve through Drug Corp acquisitions?\nInterviewer Guidance:\n- Candidate could mention:\n- Sales cannibalization. Acquiring stores in the same region may drive customers\naway from certain stores and towards other stores\n- Sales retention. Customers develop relationships with brands and Drug Corp\nstores may lose customers/sales if they begin operating as RX stores\n- Increasing retail pricing of the RX items\nDrugs “R” Us\nRecommendation\n- The RX Co CEO is walking into the room in 30 seconds. What do you have to tell him\nabout the viability of this acquisition? Should they make it?\nInterviewer Guidance:\n- Assuming no sales cannibalization and 100% sales retention, it is already clear that\nRX cannot meet its pharma revenue targets through the acquisition. Additional risks\nbelow that could be mentioned compound this recommendation.\n- Risks\n- Sales Cannibalization\n- Sales Retention\n- Issues with transferring DEA licenses\n- Delays in acquisition and conversion through regulatory delay (DEA licenses, liquor licenses,\netc), brand conversions, IT/HR/Accounting/Back Office systems integration, etc.\n- Consumer backlash if pricing is increased",

Given the cost of servicing all the\ncustomers is similar, there is an opportunity\nto optimize sales cost here.\nChemical Imbalance\nPrompt #4:\n- Once the candidate delivers the key insight from Exhibit # 2, ask them to brainstorm\nsome potential ways to reduce the cost of serving consumer goods manufacturers.\nInterviewer Guidance:\n- Some of the potential ways to optimize the cost of serving the consumer goods\nmanufacturers:\n- Sales through distributors\n- Changing internal sales model (use indirect sales model)\n- E-commerce (sale through website/ app)\n- Sales through mailed paper catalogues\n- Sales through in-house call center (remote sales)\nPrompt #5:\nThe CEO of ChemCo is about to walk-in. What is your recommendation to him?\nChemical Imbalance\nRecommendation\n- Recommendation: I recommend that ChemCo should adopt indirect sales or sale\nthrough distributors to service consumer goods manufacturers (for Commodity\nproducts).\n- Result: This will result in optimization of salesforce headcount and associated Sales\ncost, which is currently much higher than competitors.\n- Justification: Direct sales approach is expensive and consumer goods manufacturers\ndo not yield enough revenue to justify the cost of direct sales approach.\n- Risks/ Challenges: Customer concerns for quality of service, Employee backlash due\nto headcount reduction, Building new capabilities/ relationships with dealers, etc.\n- Next step: Get more data on costs of direct and indirect sales approach, estimate\ncosts for introducing recommended mode to determine cost savings\nInterviewer Guidance:\n- There is room for optimizing the sales model for servicing the consumer goods\nmanufacturers. The recommendation is designed to be somewhat flexible as long as\nthe interviewee suggests selling through distributors or changing internal sales\nmodel for these customers backed by sound reasoning, that should be considered\nas a valid recommendation.\n- An exceptional candidate will note that specialty products require more customer inputs\nand hence, recommend distributor/ indirect sales approach for commodity products only.",

What did you do about it?\n- What three things would your previous supervisor identify as your areas of improvement?\nPrompt\nOver the last few years some states have legalized medical marijuana sales on a prescription basis, and some have even legalizedrecreational use.\nThe cultivation and sales of marijuana most often take place in small storefronts called dispensaries. In most states, limitshave been created on\nhow many dispensaries are allowed to exist at any one time.\nYour client, North Carolina Tobacco Company, made $8 Billion in revenue and $2 Billion in profits last year, but has seen declining use of cigarettes\nin the United States, which currently makes up 25% of its total revenue and profit. NC Tobacco is considering moving into therecreational\nmarijuana market. What should they do? Assume that federal regulations are not a concern in this case.\nInterviewer Guidance\nProvide if requested:\n- Global use of tobacco has not declined and is even increasing in some areas\n- NC Tobacco is interested in diversifying their portfolio of products\n- NC Tobacco is normally focused on long-term profitability, but because this is a very new market they aren’t completely sure what else they\nshould be thinking about.\n- NC Tobacco only interested in entering the recreational market, as medical marijuana is highly regulated and requires the dispensary to be a not\nfor profit organization. (Assume recreational dispensaries are for-profit)\nA good candidate will recognize that this is a market entry question. The framework can include:\n- Market Evaluation: Market Size, barriers to entry,\n- Entry: Buy, Build, Partner\n- Economics: Costs, Revenue, synergies with cigarette business, NPV\n- Risks: Political fallout in NC (tobacco centric state), Negative PR for getting in drug business, potential substitution of cigarettesales, consumer\ndistaste for ‘big corporate’, problems with financing (banks don’t want to finance due to risks associated with Marijuana). 149\nCase 10: Going Green\nPrompt\nNC Tobacco is interested in Washington and Colorado, which are two states that have legalized recreational use of marijuana. What is\nthe potential market size in Washington and Colorado?\nInterviewer Guidance\nGuide the candidate toward a top-down approach. Provide the following information if requested:\n- Colorado Population: 5 Million\n- Colorado Population that smokes: 15%\n- Washington Population: 7 Million\n- Washington Population that smokes: 10%\n- Number of grams consumed per week: 1\n- Price per gram (assume this is the equivalent of 1 marijuana cigarette): $15\nCandidate should lay out information requested on an organized chart or data table.\nAnalysis\nWashington Market size: $15/gram * 50 grams/yr * 7M people * 10% = $525 M\nColorado Market Size: $15/gram *50 grams/yr * 5M people * 15% = $562.5 M\nCandidate should note a fairly large market size relative to current NC Tobacco profits, and a relatively larger market size in Colorado.\nCase 10: Going Green\nPrompt\nNow that NC Tobacco understands the market size, how should they enter the market?\nInterviewer Guidance\nThe candidate should analyze the cost/benefits for buy, build or partner. Guide them to the primary analysis of buy or build,ifthey\ndon’t arrive there quickly. If candidate inquires about JV, assume NC Tobacco wants full control of the process. The candidate should\napproach this in a structured way that analyzes the positives and negatives of each. Utilizing a table is one way to facilitate this:\nAnalysis\nStrategy Buy Build\nBenefits - Quick toramp up and capitalize on first mover advantage - Easier to build culture\n- Utilize local expertise - Fewconsolidated competitors means less competition\n- Few states have marijuana cigarettes so easy to consolidate - Similar products may allow ease of entrance into market\n- Utilize local brand recognition\nDisadvantages - Integrationinto new company - Limitedlicenses distributed restrict ability to build from scratch\n- Scattered, independent operators may make consolidation - Timeto grow plants, establish brand name and sell may take too\nchallenging long -other competitors may enter\n- Financing may be challenging for marijuana dispensary\npurchases\nRecommendation\nCandidate should recall limited amount of licenses distributed and recognize that building would be more difficult. Client should buy\nrather than build.\nCase 10: Going Green\nPrompt\nNC Tobacco is interested in purchasing a portion of the dispensaries currently in the market. What do they need to know in orderto\ndetermine the worthiness of the investment, and which market they should enter, if any?\nInterviewer Guidance\nPotential avenues of pursuit could be an ROI, a Breakeven, or an NPV analysis. Guide the candidate towards an NPV analysis and a\ndetermination of the value of the purchases to NC Tobacco. Once they have asked for financial information, provide Exhibit 1.\nThe first step of this analysis is to determine the revenue for each individual dispensary.

An excellent candidate will realize that both are viable\noptions due to the positive NPV..\nCase 10: Going Green\nPrompt\nShould NC Tobacco move forward with purchasing dispensaries? What are some other factors that NC Tobacco might want to consider\nbefore moving forward with their decision?\nInterviewer Guidance\nCandidate should provide a conclusion slide clearly identifying the recommendation, along with the risks associated with the strategy.\nRecommended action would be to move forward with purchase of both Colorado and Washington dispensaries due to NPV, but the\ncandidate can make a case for either moving forward or for not purchasing as long as sufficient support is provided. This is a good\nopportunity to push the candidate with ‘what else’ questions, particularly during the risk assessment.\nCase 10: Going Green\nAnalysis\nPotential Rationale for moving forward with purchase:\n- Positive NPV\n- Higher profit margin than cigarettes\n- First mover advantage\n- Potential high-growth market as more states legalize\n- Synergistic opportunities in supply chain, marketing, etc.\n- New (and highly loyal) customer base\n- Cigarettes inviable for long term\nPotential Rationale for not continuing:\n- NPV small for company making $8 Billion/yr in revenue\n- Potential variability in projected vs. actual income statement estimates\n- Potentially low estimate of purchase price (given low NPV/store)\n- Potential first mover disadvantage\n- Negative PR for getting in ‘drug’ business\n- Potential substitution of cigarette sales\n- Potential consumer distaste for ‘big business’\n- Problems with financing (banks don’t want to finance due to risks associated with Marijuana)\n- Cigarette sales still strong abroad -focus on international opportunities\nCase 10: Going Green\nPerformance Evaluation\n- Thiscase tests the candidate’s ability to:\nWork through complicated math\no\nDevelop structured approaches to problems\no\nRecall key facts discussed earlier in the case\no\nUnderstand key factors that drive market entry and M&A cases\no\nMake a recommendation in the face of ambiguous information\no\nRemain professional in a business case that may otherwise encourage individuals to lose their professionalism\no\n- Good interviewees will:\nWill have an understanding where the case is going throughout\no\nHave 1-2 math errors but recovers appropriately\no\nDisplays good ability to utilize public math\no\nCreates basic MECE structure (bucketed approach, etc.) to analyze problems\no\nProvides conclusion with support\no\nProvides a recommendation after analysis with 3-4 potential risk factors\no\nMaintains professional composure throughout\no\n- Exceptional interviewees will\nDrive the case forward throughout with hypothesis based inquiry\no\nHave 0 math errors\no\nWill maintain composure throughout the math\no\nAdd creative ideas to qualitative analysis\no\nAddresses prompts with advanced matrices or analytical structures that show depth of thinking and organization\no\nIs engaging, displays interest in the subject and has appropriate body posture and presence\no\nProvides a strong, efficient, concise recommendation with at least 4-5 risk factors.\no",

Recently the\nlandlord for the firm’s headquarters in Oakland raised rent by $35M. Customer\nservice complaints have increased nearly 3,000%, which the company believes is\ndue to the new 12 inch seats that were installed in the entire fleet. This has caused\nSardine’s call center provider to increase billing by 520% from 2014’s $12.36M. What\ncan Sardine Airlines do to address these issues?\nInterviewer Guidance:\n- Neither the CEO or Board will take any recommendations on cutting the marketing\nexpenses\n- The firm does not have to be headquartered in Oakland, but does want to be in a\nlocation where it has major operations\n- The firm is not interested in increasing seat sizes. They are actually looking to pilot 8\ninch seats in a new class of service called, “steerage”\n- The call center vendor charges rates that are on average 60% higher because their\ncall center’s are based in the United States and staffed with native English speakers\n- Rent in Tulsa or Hartford would be 40% less than current 2015 rent (INTERVIEWER\nGUIDANCE this equates to $34.4M)\nSardine Airlines\nRecommendation\n- The CEO, Ms. McPincher is going to be joining us in just a few minutes to hear your\nrecommendations on how to improve profitability.\nInterviewer Guidance:\n- Candidate should have a recommendation that includes the following:\n- To increase profit margin to 20%, Sardine Airlines should focus on cutting SG&A\ncosts\n- There are two key ways to cut SG&A, customer service and rent\n- Recommend that the call center vendor should transition to an overseas based\nvendor, which would save approximately $38M\n- Move the headquarters to either Tulsa or Hartford, which will have less expensive\noffice real estate markets and thus find major cost savings\n- Given the relative low increase in revenue from installing 12” inch seats,\nrecommend against 8” seats\n- Risks should include: one-time expenses in moving the headquarters, unhappy\ncustomers from decreased customer service quality",

As the name suggests, it is a UK based bank and deals in retail services\nlike mortgages, savings, loans, and credit cards. The bank’s revenues are rising, but the profits\nare declining. The client has asked you to identify why the profits are declining and to suggest\nstrategies to stem the decline.\nCandidate\nProfits have two components – revenues and costs. I’d like to explore the following areas:\n- Revenues – what is driving them?\n- A new (more expensive) product mix being sold\n- Pricing (is the revenue growth due to low pricing)\n- Costs – are costs increasing disproportionately\n- The fixed costs like people, offices or advertising\n- The variable costs like transaction costs\n- Industry profitability trends\nDepending on what the cause for the profit decline is, we may want to consider one or more of:\n- Changing the product mix offered or promoted.\n- Changing the pricing.\n- Rationalizing operations.\n- Reviewing fixed costs.\nEtc.\nInterviewer\nOn doing your research, you find out that the lowering of profits is due to the high cost of\nfunding customer growth, including heavy advertising and introduction of high-cost products.\nSince the size of the bank is small, the CEO wants to grow by acquisition in order to achieve\neconomies of scale. The candidate European banks are:\n\nNumber of Average number of Average\nCustomers products/customer profit/customer\n‘000 £\nLuxembourg\n400 1.8 100\nBank\nBank\n1200 1.6 150\nBelgique\nBank\n4800 1.6 120\nFrance\nWhich bank would you select for acquisition and why?\nCandidate\nJust on the basis of this chart, it looks like Bank France has a large customer base, which may be\nan asset as we are looking to achieve economies of scale. The profits of Bank France are the\nhighest at 4.8 M x £120 = £576M. However, it seems like they are not the best target since even\nthough they are 4 times of Bank Belgique, their profits per customer are lower. This may signal\nthat they are not the best for helping attain economies of scale, although there may be other,\nrevenue-side reasons for lower per customer profits. I will go with Bank Belgique, which\ncertainly has the highest profits per customer, which will help Bank UK with the profitability\nproblem directly, as well as through economies of scale as being 4 times larger (number of\ncustomers) than Luxembourg Bank, it also has 50% higher per customer profits. Seems like they\ndo know a bit about managing their operations.\nInterviewer\nInteresting. Now I have a little math exercise for you. After the base figure of 400,000 customers,\nfor each additional100,000 customers, a further 4.125% operational cost is reduced from the cost.\nTotal costs are 60% of revenues. Assuming equal profit per customer for both banks at £100,\nhow much is the cost of Bank?\nCandidate\nLuxembourg Bank has 400,000 customers, while Bank Belgique has 1,200,000. Thus Bank\nBelgique has 800,000 more than Luxembourg Bank.\n8 x 4.125 = 32+1 = 33% less cost\nSince profit per customer = 100 = 40% of revenue per customer, therefore\nCosts/customer = 100 x 60 / 40 = 150\nTotal additional costs = 1.2 M x £150 x 67%\n= 1.2 M x £100\n= £120 M",

I did not get a case about international\nexpansion in my interviews.\nA major US beer company, Beer Brew, recently entered the UK market. Two years after entry,\nthe company is still losing money. Despite a high per capita consumption of beer in the UK\nmarket, sales have been very disappointing. What explains this phenomenon?\nRECOMMENDED SOLUTION\nHigh Level Plan of Attack\n- Evaluate the product mix of the company and compare it to what is selling well in the UK.\n- Analyze what type of marketing Beer Brew is using.\n- Understand the consumer behavior and tastes, and determine the effect on sales.\nLay Out Your Thoughts\n- Use the profitability framework. Understand which factor under revenue or costs is driving\nthe decline in profitability.\nDig Deeper: Gather Facts/Make Calculations\n- Let's begin with the product mix. What kind of beer has Beer Brew been trying to sell?\nCurrently, Beer Brew is selling two kinds of beer, a strong tasting and a light beer.\n- How have the sales of both been doing? The strong tasting beer is selling slightly below\naverage and the light beer is not selling at all.\n\n- What about marketing? The company has spent more on marketing than the industry average\nfor that region.\n- Is it a highly competitive industry? It's about average. The industry is fairly fragmented. There\nare no dominant players.\n- Any problems with distribution channels? No.\n- What about pricing and placement of the product? To be competitive, Beer Brew undercut its\nprice significantly to try to capture customers. Their beer is sold just about everywhere other\nbrands are sold.\n- What are the current best sellers of beers in the UK? Guinness, Toby, and a few others.\n- What kind common characteristics do they have? They are all moderate in alcohol level, dark,\nand strong tasting.\n- How does that compare to Beer Brew's products? Beer Brew's strong tasting brand is higher\nin alcohol, and market tests show that it tastes better. The light beer is low in alcohol and\ncalories, and again tastes great.\n- Are there any light beers on the market? Very few. Mostly local. Beer Brew saw this as an\nopportunity to cash in on the light beer industry that has taken the US market by storm.\n- Since most of the beer consumed in the UK is dark, and dark signifies strong beer, does the\nlight color of the beer signal to the consumer that somehow the beer is weak? Perhaps, but the\ncompany figured that once the consumer tried it, the color wouldn't make any difference.\nKey Findings\n- It seems that the consumer in the UK has unique drinking habits. After further inquiry, we\nfind that the average British drinker values dark beer over any other factor. It seems that the\ndark color has a psychological impact on the consumer, relating it to strength, masculinity,\ngetting their money's worth, etc.\n- The light beer industry is undeveloped in the UK because the health movement in the US has\nnot mobilized in Europe yet.\n- Also, because the price of Beer Brew's products is much cheaper than other brands on the\nmarket, it is portrayed as a low quality \"American beer.\"\n- There has been a dilution of the brand equity.\nRecommendations\n- Change the color of the stronger tasting beer. Make it darker and advertise it as the better\ntasting darker beer, with more alcohol.\n- Match the price to other premium beers that focus on the same market segment.\nDrop the light beer product line. The UK is not ready for it yet.",

I like this because it is different from\nmost usual problems. Your client is the president of an electronics group, which is essentially an\nR&D think-tank. It is a very innovative place which employs 100 engineers who buy\ncomponents and create prototype innovative products for cars. This place is bursting with energy,\nand they already have many great products to their credit.\nFor instance, they have already developed a prototype navigation system. Similarly, they\ndiscovered that many of the deaths due to road accidents are preventable. The problem is that\nmedical services don’t reach there in time either because they don’t get to know about the\naccident at all or they don’t know exactly where it happened. In most such accidents, the victims\neither lose consciousness or are decapacitated. So they have created this device which is a\ncombination of GPS, airbags and cell phones. The way it works is that on impact, the airbags\ninflate, and the cell phone calls 911, pinpointing the directions using the GPS.\n\nThese guys are full of ideas, and some of the projects under consideration are night-vision for\ncars (using F-14 technology), backing sensors and so on.\nHowever, their costs range is high. The fundamental issue is that the engineers are like kids in a\ncandy shop. They are doing very exciting work and love their jobs. However, there are random\nprojects going on all over the place. The president wants to streamline the operations and focus\non 10-20 projects rather than the more than 100 that are going on right now.\nHow will you prioritize the projects, deciding which ones to focus on and which ones to\nabandon? How will you convince the engineers, who are basically innovative brains and do not\nunderstand business, of your decision?\nCandidate\nTo prioritize the projects, I will probably so by the basic economics, focusing on the projects that\nare likely to bring in the most profits. Thus, some of the factors I will look at are:\n- Probability of successful completion\n- Probability of an automobile manufacturer buying it/ of commercialization\n- Demand and price elasticity in the market\n- Speed to market because money has a time value\n- Practicality of the idea in general\nTo convince the engineers of the decision, I would focus on the following issues:\n- Speed to market\n- Ease of selling\n- Practicality of mass-production\n- Share of royalty\n- Profits: Success of the company, and individual success\nInterviewer\nOkay, interesting. Let’s take these one by one. You said that you want to prioritized based on the\neconomics. How do you get a handle on the expected profits?\nCandidate\nI will proceed in a structured manner, starting off with Profits = Revenues – Costs (or expected\nprofits = expected revenues – expected costs). We can find these figures by subjectively\nassessing probabilities of success in different durations and to different levels and calculating the\nexpected monetary values.\nI am assuming that the costs aspect could be as follows:\nI would probably not want to break this down into fixed and variable costs as you said the\ncompany is engaged in creating prototypes. Thus, variable costs are wiped off the slate since\nquantity produced is equal to one. They only have R&D costs which can be split into human\nresources, material and overheads apportioned. The human resources costs would likely follow a\nsimilar pattern, and would depend on the time taken in completion.\nTo deal with the revenues, I will use the simple equation\nRevenues = Price x Volumes\n\nPlease understand that since we are dealing with prioritization, I am looking at revenues, costs\nand profits for individual projects rather than the company. I guess we can have some estimate of\nthe volume by looking at the product life cycle.\nAt launch we would have only the innovators and the early adopters and we’ll have to cross the\nchasm before being able to reach an early majority. Normally, I would think, the only role costs\nplay in pricing is to make sure that at the volume and pricing, costs including R&D and\nfixed+variable costs of mass production are covered. The pricing is typically based on what the\nconsumer is willing to pay for it. To be able to make a better analysis of the revenues, both from\nthe prices perspective and the volume perspective, I will need to understand how this firm earns\nits revenues. Can you help me with that?\nInterviewer\nSure. The company has good relations with an automobile manufacturing company to which it\nsells it’s ideas. The automobile company hands it a royalty check based on estimated revenues\ndepending on how they can price it. They also have the option of earning the royalties over 5-6\nyears based on actual revenues.\nCandidate\nSo that rules out cost-considerations, pretty much?\nInterviewer\nIt does.\nCandidate\nIs it fair to assume that volumes lose much of its relevance as the automobile company will fit\nthe product in all cars of a particular model.\nInterviewer\nThat is a fair assessment.\nCandidate\nSince pricing for end-consumer seems to be an important factor here, I’d want to explore what\nthe end-consumer is willing to pay for the product.\nInterviewer\nAnd how would you go about doing that?\n\nCandidate\nBy conducting some market research. Maybe even conducting a conjoint analysis on\nautomobiles with different products, and prioritizing on the basis of that?\nInterviewer\nWhat is conjoint analysis?\nCandidate\nConjoint analysis is a market research technique wherein the customers are presented with\nproducts with different attribute options, and their responses are analyzed to figure out which\nattribute options they prefer and how much they value each. Ummm…but yeah, there’s a\nproblem that to conduct this analysis we need prototypes, and here we want to do the analysis\nbefore the prototype is created. I guess that could be solved by paper prototyping or giving out\nthe product idea in some way.\nInterviewer\nHmmm….but this method assumes that consumers know about their preferences. The engineers\nwould argue that since these are very innovative products, consumers don’t have enough\ninformation to develop sensible preferences before they can actually use them.\nCandidate\nPerhaps we could try using an economic-value based pricing model then.\nInterviewer\nWhat does that mean?\nCandidate\nIt essentially means we find out how much economic benefit the consumer gains from using the\nproduct. That economic benefit is then split between the consumer and the manufacturer.\nInterviewer\nOkay, so how do you gauge the economic benefit a GPS has over a $5 map?\nCandidate\nI guess we could look at the average time saved, put it against the average worth of the\nconsumers’ time. Ummm….I guess we are not reaching anywhere with this approach. Could we\npossibly compare the products to similar products produced by competition?\nInterviewer\nFor normal products you can do reference pricing. But, as I said, these are highly innovative,\ncompletely new products. There is nothing you can compare any of these new products to.\nCandidate\nI guess the only way left is to look at the products sold in the past or selling at present. I suppose\nit should be possible to determine price-elasticities of demand for different categories of products.\nFor instance, demand would normally be less elastic for safety products. In other words, people\n\nwould be willing to pay more for products that they perceive as making them safer on the road,\njust like they are normally willing to pay more for kids’ pharmaceuticals.\nInterviewer\nRight! That’s exactly what we did. We are almost out of time here, but let me tell you what we\ndid in this case. Following the same logic as you did, we concluded that there are different\nattitudes that people have towards different types of products. We plotted all their products on\ntwo axes – value and frequency of use. We found that there was a pattern like this:\nSafety Convenience\nValue/ Use\nUtility\nFrequency\nThe products that are infrequently used but are perceived as having high value are safety\nproducts – in fact you wish you never have to use them. The GPS-Airbag-Cellphone\ncombination I mentioned earlier falls in this category. Then there are products that are useful, but\nare used relatively frequently. These are convenience products like GPS. Then there are items\nthat are less useful but are very frequently used….like power windows. These, we called utility\nitems.\nInvariably, products in the top-left corner were more successful. That’s where we took the leap\nof faith, and said that in general people are willing to pay more for safety products, and are more\nlikely to buy them. We recommended that the company prioritize their products on the basis of\nthis chart…based on where the proposed product falls on this chart. Which, of course, they did.\nCandidate\nWow! This was indeed a very different and interesting case. I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n(This was an extraordinary case in several ways. For one, the interviewer spoke more than I did,\nwhich is very uncommon for a case-interview. Then, the way the case is set up, applying\ntraditional frameworks to crack it takes up a lot of time, though at the end you do reach close to\nthe answer as I did. Lastly, this is the only McKinsey case without numbers that I have seen)",

In particular it manufactures\ncardiology devices called stunts. Do you know what a stunt is?\nCandidate\nI’m sorry, I don’t.\nInterviewer\nDon’t worry, not many people do. A stunt is a wire mesh tube that is installed in the body of the\npatient to clear up heart blockages.\nNow, Heart Corp has developed a new device, that we will call Device X, which is a\nfundamental improvement over traditional stunts.\nHeart Corp has decided to launch it first in Europe and then, 1 year later, in the USA. The\nmanagement is struggling with what price they should set for Device X in the Europe.\n\nSince it is a breakthrough product, they obviously wish to charge a price premium for it.\nWhat are the key inputs that will help you help them set a price?\nCandidate\n- I will be thinking about several factors, the first of which is differentiation – how much better\nis our product compared to the others in the market?\n- Is this difference relevant to the customer – though at first glance, it does look like it is – and\nhow relevant is it?\n- What are the substitutes available and how are they priced?\n- Does it have any side-effects?\n- What are the volumes we expect to sell at different price levels? In other words, what is the\ncustomer’s price-elasticity – though it is relatively low for medical products?\n- What are the fundamental economics in terms of sunk, fixed and variable costs?\n- What is the product’s economic value to the customer – how much money does it save?\nInterviewer\nInteresting. Let us follow-up a bit on the economic value to the consumer.\nCandidate\nWhat are the costs associated with a surgery with stunt, and how do these change when X is\nused?\nInterviewer\n- We know that for each surgery, there are hospitalization costs of 2500.\n- Then there is the cost of the device itself. Stunts costs $500 each, and two are used in each\noperation.\n- Once the operation is done, there is a 20% chance that the surgery will be 100% successful.\n- In 50% cases, follow-up surgery is required with costs identical to above.\n- For the purpose of this interview, we will assume that this is not a chain or a nested loop, and\nthe follow-up surgery is required only once. Follow-up to follow-ups are not required.\n- There is also a 30% chance that there will be complications, necessitating open-heart surgery,\nwhich costs $15000.\n- If device X is used, there is a 5% chance of complications, and no follow-up surgery is\nrequired.\nCandidate\n(Hmm…classical decision tree)\n\n20.0% 0\nSuccess\n0 -3500\nFALSE Chance\nUse Stunt\n-3500 -9750\n50.0% 0\nFollow Up\n-3500 -7000\n30.0% 0\nOpen Heart\n-15000 -18500\nDecision\nStunt vs X\n95.0% 0.95\nSuccess\n0 -3500\nTRUE Chance\nUse X\n-3500 -4250\n0.0% 0\nFollow Up\n-3500 -7000\n5.0% 0.05\nOpen Heart\n-15000 -18500\nAssumptions\nHospitalization Costs -2500\nStunt Cost -500\nX Cost -500\nNumber of Devices Used 2\nProb Success (Stunt) 20%\nProb Follow Up (Stunt) 50%\nProb Complication (Stunt) 30%\nProb Success (X) 95%\nProb Follow Up (X) 0%\nProb Complication (X) 5%\nCost of Open Heart Surgery -15000\nBranches of Node Decision vs. $B$23\n-5000 -4500 -4000 -3500 -3000 -2500 -2000 -1500 -1000\n$B$23\nnoisiceD\n1 : Use Stunt 2 : Use X\nPrecisionTre Student Version\nFor Academic Use Only\nAs is clear from the sensitivity chart above, the decision changes at $3250 per device.\nOf course, in the interview, you will not have the luxury of Excel or Palisade’s Decision Tools\nSuite. The above discussion has been given just to help direct your thinking. Here is how I did it\nin the interview:\n\nWith a stunt,\nAverage Costs = 2500 + 2 x 500 + ( 0.2 x 0 + 0.5 x (2500 + 2 x 500) + 0.3 x 15000)\nWith X (assuming variable A represents price of X),\nAverage Costs = 2500 + 2 x A + (0.95 x 0 + 0 x (2500 + 2 x A) + 0.05 x 15000)\nAt the tipping point, these costs should be equal, so\n2 x 500 + 0.5 x 3500 + 0.3 x 15000 = 2 x A + 0.05 x 15000\nA = ( (0.3 – 0.05) x 15000 + 1750 + 1000 ) / 2\nA = 6500/2\nA = 3250\nThus, purely on the basis of the financials, the maximum price that can be put on the device is\n$3250. However, it does not mean that we necessarily put the price of $3250 on the device for\nthere are other factors to be considered.\nFor one, 3250 is the price at which the customer will be ambivalent or indifferent to the two\noptions, were they to decide on purely financial criteria. Our objective is not to make them\nindifferent, but to make them favor X. Typically firms seek to increase the value proposition of\ntheir product by pricing it lower than the economic value realized by it, so that the customers\nbenefit from their product, and thus prefer it. In essence, this means that Heart Corp should price\nX less than 3250.\nIn this calculation, I have not included a portion of economic benefit that will accrue from fewer\ndays of hospitalization….things like loss of income. Also, non-monetary benefits like Health\nAdjusted Life Years (HALY) of the new device should be considered in any serious pricing\nexercise.\nAnyways, to place the lower limit, we need to look at costs and make sure they are sufficiently\nlower than such a lower limit. If we have sufficient production and distribution capacity, as well\nas low enough costs, we may want to price X at or slightly under 500 to make it a decisive\nadvantage, and practically replace the stunt market with market for X. Practically, though, my\nfeel is that Heart Corp would do well to realize 50% of the economic benefit and that such a\nposition will also provide it a good value proposition.\nInterviewer\nSo, what price would you recommend?\nCandidate\nI would recommend a price of about $2000.\nInterviewer\nAre there any other factors that you would consider?\nCandidate\nWe have to keep in mind that as for most medical devices, the price-elasticity would be low. We\nneed to weight that against the total size of the market and also include the sunk costs of R&D,\ntesting and approvals. We also need to consider whether we have patents, for how long we have\n\nthem, and how easily replicable the production is. Are there any adverse side-effects of the\ndevice? Are there any positive side-effects of the device? Those would probably be the main\nthings I would think about.\nInterviewer\nIf your customers are hospitals that perform 75 procedures per year and have a budget of $900\nthousand for these procedures, how would you price the device X?\nCandidate\n(Ouch! That hurts – I went through the whole calculation and pricing as if the customer was\nactually the patient….never once asking the interviewer the fundamental question: who is our\ncustomer?). OK. I performed the above calculations assuming that the patient is the customer.\nThe hospitals that are my customers…you said they perform 75 procedures per year. Does that\nrefer to original treatment or does it include follow-up surgery as well?\nInterviewer\n75 is the total number of surgeries they perform.\nCandidate\nOK. So this means they perform 50 operations and then have to perform 25 follow-up operations.\nThus they are currently spending:\n75 x 3500 + 15 x 15000 = 15 x (17500+15000) = 15 x 22500 = 337,500\nWe have to price the device so that they stay well within budget. Therefore (assuming P= price\nof X)\n50 x (2500 + 2 x P) + 2.5 x 15000 900,000\n100 x P 900,000 – 125,000 – 37,500\nP 737,500 / 100\nP 7,375\nThis upper limit is higher than the limit of 3,250 we had set according to the economic benefit\nearlier. Thus, the earlier answer holds. I will price the stunts at 2000. Thus the hospital will\nspend:\n50 x 6500 + 2.5 x 1500\n= 325,000 + 37,500\n= 362,500 which is well under its budget.\nThrough this price, it can also be demonstrated that just for the increase of 25,000 dollars, the\nhospital is able to provide better service, save its patients money, perform more operations\n(lesser hospitalization days increase availability of beds), and increase the HALY of its patients,\nall of which go to enhance its reputation and ultimately its revenues and profits. Umm….actually,\na better way could be to tell the hospital that they can realize these gains without spending\nexta…\n50 x (2500 + 2 x P) + 2.5 x 15000 = 337500\n100 x P = 337500 – 125000 – 37500\nP = 175000 / 100\nP = 1750\nThus, I will price X at 1750.\n\nInterviewer\n(Smiled through the last part – I guess this was the answer he was looking for). Good. Okay, let’s\nsay you price at $1750 per device. You have a bulk pricing system.\n- All customers get a discount of $250 per device. No further discount is given on the first 10\ndevices.\n- Devices 11-50 get an additional discount of $200 per device\n- Devices 51 onwards get another $300 off per device\n- There is also a loyalty discount, wherein if the customer spends over 50% of his budget on X,\nhe is given 10% discount, over and above other discounts, on the total bill.\nWhat is the average price if the average number of procedures your customers have every year is\n75 and their average budget is $900K?\nCandidate\nIs it fair to assume a normal distribution of the number of procedures? If so, what is the standard\ndeviation?\nInterviewer\nExcellent question. But we are running out of time. It won’t be necessary to use the distribution.\nJust use the average values.\nCandidate\n75 procedures translate into 150 devices.\nThe first 10 have a discount of $250 each…so sell for 1500 x 10 = 15000\nNext 40 have a discount of $450…so sell for 1300 x 40 = 52000\nNext 100 have a discount of $750…so sell for 1000 x 100 = 100000\nThis comes to a total of 167000\n150 devices sold at 167000\nAverage price per device = 167000/150 = 334000/300 = $1113.33\nInterviewer\nWe have talked about two possible customers for X: the patient and the hospital. Can you think\nof any other customers? What will be your pitch in selling to them?\nCandidate\nSure, I can think of the government and insurance companies as possible customers. As for\ninsurance companies, the premise will be the same as patient – they will have to pay less for the\nprocedure….in fact, this will be even more effective on them as an individual operation is a low-\nstakes game for them and they look at the average figures. Also, if HALY is increased, their\nfuture pay-outs are also decreased. So they should be pressing hospitals to use X instead of stunts.\nAs for governments, I guess I will appeal to the welfare state part in that the HALY of citizens is\nincreased…fewer days of hospitalization means less of productivity is taken away off the nation.\nYeah, I think those are the primary possible customers.",

In fact, I would be pretty disappointed if you didn’t take notes. Today, we will talk\nabout Designer Depot – a national retailer of luxury women’s clothing. It is a very profitable\nbusiness, and has a stable, dominant market position. The problem is that it is reaching the limits\nof geographical expansion. The company has retained McKinsey to help it maintain its growth.\nWhat are the avenues of growth available to Designer Depot?\nCandidate\nMay I take a couple of minutes to structure my thoughts?\nInterviewer\nSure. We’ll start when you are ready.\nCandidate\n(after about a minute). Okay, the major avenues of growth available to Designer Depot are:\n- Get more new customers\n\n- Sell more to existing customers\n- Create more occasions\n- Sell more on each occasion\n- Introduce new products\n- Increase distribution density\n- Expand internationally\n- Tie-up with other chains\n- Acquire other chains\nInterviewer\nGood. Let’s explore the acquisition path a little more. What are the things you will keep in mind\nwhile considering an acquisition target?\nCandidate\nI will look for:\n- Financial attractiveness\n- High number of synergies\n- Designers – are their opportunities for consolidation.\n- Brands – the brand should not be incompatible and should not dilute the brand of\nDesigner Depot\n- Market or location – location is important in retail, and while increase in distribution\ndensity may be good, having two stores in the same mall may not be such a great idea.\nA more uniformly dispersed distribution may be better.\n- Customers – if the new chain will bring in new customers, that should be good, as\nlong as it does not alienate the existing customers.\n- Management – is the management equipped to handle this.\n- Sourcing of materials etc – there should be opportunities for consolidation of supply\nchain.\n- Competition – will it give us a more dominant position.\nInterviewer\nDesigner Depot is looking to acquire a chain called Frivolous Fashion with the objective of\ngrowing – of getting access to new customers. The customer base for Designer Depot and\nFrivolous Fashion is the same. What will be the percent growth in Designer Depot’s customers\non acquisition of Frivolous Fashion, given that:\n200M purchasing adults in US\n5% of all women purchase designer\n50% of these purchase at DD\n20% of the 5% purchase at FF\n80% of women at FF also purchase at DD\nCandidate\nNew = 20% of 20% of 5% of 50% of 200 M\n20% 5M = 1 M\n20% 1M = 200K\n2.5 M\n\n200/2500 = 8% increase\nInterviewer\nThat’s not much good then. Designer Depot is certainly looking for a greater than 8% increase in\nnew customers. So what are the growth options now?\nCandidate\nAll the ones above that we haven’t tried. And, of course, looking at other acquisition candidates.\nInterviewer\nRight. What does this table tell you?\nShare of fashion spending by outlet (%)\nCustomers who Customers who Customers who\nhave purchased at have purchased at have never\nDesigner Depot in Designer Depot but purchased at\nthe past 12 months not in past 12 Designer Depot\nmonths\nDesigner Depot 35 0 0\nComp 1 3 1 1\nFrivolous Fashion 5 1 3\nComp 2 1 1 1\nComp 3 1 1 2\nComp 4 20 6 6\nBoutiques 20 45 55\nOther department 15 45 32\nstores\nCandidate\nThree very important things. One – Designer Depot’s customers seem to be quite loyal.\nSecondly, I’d probably examine Comp4 for acquisition. He can bring in more new customers\nthan any other individual competitor. Perhaps even more importantly, many of our current\ncustomers shop there. So acquiring Comp4 is likely to significantly increase out share of wallet.\nThirdly, I’d be very interested in finding out what the boutiques and other department stores are\ndoing, as they certainly seem to have a huge chunk of the market. I mean even if we assume that\ndue to market dominance of Designer Depot, the third column constitutes only 10% of the total\nmarket, these two categories share 87% of this 10% among them. Besides even Designer Depot’s\ncurrent customer go there in large numbers, which could be a big headache. Department stores\nmight be playing the price-card, which we may not want to do with our brand, but may want to\ncounter using the acquired brand. But I have no clue what the boutiques are doing and that is an\narea I would definitely want to explore.\nInterviewer\nGreat. We are right on time. Do you have any questions for me?",

It is only a sample practice case\nprovided by Vishy Padmanabhan, Goizueta MBA '04. A.T.Kearney uses a wide variety of cases\nin its interviews.\n- Your client is a manufacturer of bicycles\n- They have been in business for 25 years\n- They manufacturer and sell three categories of bicycles:\n- Racing bikes: High end, high performance bikes for sophisticated cyclists\n- Mainstream bikes: Durable, but not overly complicated bikes for everyday riders\n- Children’s bikes: Smaller, simpler versions of their mainstream bikes for children\n- Profits at your client have decreased over the past five years\nWhat is driving the decline in overall profits? What recommendations might correct the\nsituation?\nSuggested solutions:\nThe first question is to determine what has caused overall profits to decrease. To accomplish this\nthe candidate must first understand what has transpired in each of the three product categories\n\nover the past five years during which profitability has slipped. The following are questions and\nanswers that would be provided in an interview scenario:\n- What are the client’s margins for a bicycle in each of the three segments?\n- Racing: Cost = $600/unit, Profit=$300/unit\n- Mainstream: Cost = $250/unit, Profit = $75/unit\n- Children’s: Cost = $ 200/unit, Profit = $50/unit\n- What has happened to the market size of each of the three segments over the past five years?\n- Racing: Has remained constant at its present size of $300MM\n- Mainstream: Has increased at 2% growth rate per year to its present size of $1.0B\n- Children’s: Has increased at 3% growth rate per year to its present size of $400MM\n- What has happened to our client’s market share in each of these segments?\n- Racing: Market share has decreased from 60% to 30%\n- Mainstream: Market share has increased from 0% to 5%\n- Children’s: Market share has increased from 0% to 3%\n- Who are the client’s major competitor’s in each market segment? What has happened to their\nmarket share in each segment over the past five years?\n- Racing: There is one main competitor and a host of small firms. Your main\ncompetitor has increased market share from 30% to 50%\n- Mainstream: There exist many, large competitors, none of which holds more than\n10% of the market\n- Children’s: As in the mainstream segment, there are many competitors, none with\nmore than 10% of the market\nThe above information provides enough information to put together a picture of why profits have\ndecreased over the past five years: Your client, with a commanding position in a flat market\nsegment (racing), expanded into new segments (mainstream and children’s). As this occurred,\nmarket share decreased dramatically in the most lucrative segment (racing), creating an\nunfavorable mix.\nThe extent to which profits have decreased can be deduced from some quick math : profits have\nslipped from $60MM five years ago (=60% x $300MM x 33% racing margin) to $44MM today\n( = (30% x $300MM x 33% racing margin) + (5% x $1B x 23% mainstream margin) + (3% x\n$400MM x 20% children’s margin)).\nThe dramatic decrease in market share in the racing segment is at this point still unexplained.\nQuestions that would help formulate an explanation include:\n- Have there been any major changes in product quality in your client’s racing product? Or in\nits main competitor’s racing product?\n- No\n- Have there been any major price changes in your client’s racing product? Or in its main\ncompetitor’s racing product?\n- No\n- Have there been any major changes in distribution outlets for your client’s racing product? Or\nfor its main competitor’s racing product?\n- Yes. Previously your client and its main competitor in the racing segment sold\nexclusively through small, specialty dealers. This remains unchanged for the\n\ncompetition. Your client, however, began to sell its racing bikes through mass\ndistributors and discount stores (the distribution outlets for mainstream and children’s\nbikes) as it entered the mainstream and children’s segment.\n- How do the mass distributors and discount stores price the racing bikes relative to the\nspecialty stores?\n- Prices at these stores tend to be 15 to 20% less.\n- What percent of your client’s racing sales occur in mass distributors and discount stores?\n- Effectively none. This attempt to sell through these distributors has failed\n- How has the decision to sell through mass distributor’s and discount stores affected the image\nof the client’s racing product?\n- No studies have been done.\n- How has the decision to sell through mass distributor’s and discount stores affected your\nclient’s relationship with the specialty outlets?\n- Again, no formal analysis has been performed.\nAlthough some analysis and/or survey should be performed to answer more conclusively the last\ntwo questions, a possible story can be put together. There has been no appreciable change in\neither quality or price (or any other tangible factor) of your client’s racing product relative to its\ncompetition. It is not the product that is the problem, but rather its image. As your client came\nout with lower end, mainstream and children’s products and began to push their racing segment\nthrough mass distributors and discount outlets, their reputation was compromised. Additionally,\nthe presence of the racing products in the discount outlets has put your historic racing distributor\n(the specialty shops) in a precarious position. The specialty shops must now lower price to\ncompete, thereby cutting their own profits. Instead, they are likely to push the competition’s\nproduct. Remember, your client has no direct salesforce at the retail outlets. The specialty shops\nessentially serve as your client’s sales force.\nThe above analysis offers an explanation of what has affected the top side of the profitability\nproblem. Still to be examined is the cost, or bottom side, of the profitability issue. Questions to\nuncover cost issues would include:\n- How does the client account for its costs?\n- The client has a single manufacturing and assembly plant. They have separate lines in\nthis facility to produce racing, mainstream and children’s products. They divide their\ncosts into the following categories: labor, material and overhead. Overall costs have\nbeen increasing at a fairly hefty rate of 10% per year.\n- What is the current breakdown of costs along these categories for each product segment?\n- Racing: Labor = 30%, Material = 40%, Overhead = 30%\n- Mainstream: Labor = 25%, Material = 40%, Overhead = 35%\n- Children’s: Labor = 25%, Material = 40%, Overhead = 35%\n- How has this mix of expenses changed over the past five years?\n- In all segments, labor is an increasing percentage of the costs.\n- Does the basic approach to manufacturing (i.e. the mix of labor and technology) reflect that of\nits competition?\n- Your client tells you that there is a continuing movement to automate and utilize\ntechnology to improve efficiency throughout the industry, but it is his/her opinion that\n\ntheir approach, maintaining the “human touch”, is what differentiates them from the\ncompetition. (Unfortunately, he’s right!!)\n- Is the workforce unionized?\n- Yes\n- What is the average age of the workforce?\n- 52 and climbing. There is very little turnover in the workforce.\n- What is the present throughput rating? How has it changed over the past five years?\n- Presently the plant is producing at about 80% of capacity. This has been decreasing\nsteadily over the last several years.\n- What is the typical reason for equipment shutdown?\n- Emergency repair\n- Describe the preventive maintenance program in effect at the client’s facility?\n- Preventive maintenance is performed informally based on the knowledge of senior\ntechnicians.\n- How often has equipment been replaced? Is this consistent with the original equipment\nmanufacturer’s recommendations?\n- The client feels that most OEM recommendations are very conservative. They have\nfollowed a philosophy of maximizing the life of their equipment and have generally\ndoubled OEM recommendations.\nThe above information is sufficient to add some understanding to the cost side of the equation.\nYour client has an aging workforce and plant that is behind the times in terms of technology and\ninnovation. This has contributed to excessive breakdowns, decreased throughput, increased labor\nrates (wages increase with seniority) and greater labor hours (overtime to fix broken machines).\nIn proposing recommendations to improve the client’s situation, there is no single correct\napproach. There are a number of approaches that might be explored and recommended. The\nfollowing are some possibilities:\n- Abandon the mainstream and children’s segment to recover leadership in the racing segment.\nIssues to consider in this approach:\n- How much of the racing segment is “recoverable”?\n- What are the expected growth rates of each segment?\n- How badly damaged is the relationship with the specialty outlets?\n- Are there alternative outlets to the specialty shops such as internet sales?\n- How will this move affect overall utilization of the operating facilities?\n- Maintain the mainstream and children’s segment, but sell under a different name. Issues to\nconsider in this approach:\n- Is there demand among the mass and discount distributors for bicycles under their\nname?\n- What additional advertising and promotions costs might be incurred?\n- What are the expected growth rates of each segment?\n- What is driving the buying habits of the mainstream and children’s market?\n- Reduce costs through automation and innovation. Issues to be considered:\n- What technological improvements are to be made?\n- What are the required investments?\n- What are the expected returns on those investments?\n\n- How will these investments affect throughput?\n- To which lines are these investments appropriate?\n- Are the mainstream and children’s segments potentially “over-engineered”?\n- What impact will this have on the required workforce levels?\n- If layoffs are required to achieve the benefits, what impact will this have on labor\nrelations?\n- Reduce costs through establishing a formal preventive maintenance program. Issues to be\nconsidered:\n- What organizational changes will be required?\n- What analysis will be performed to determine the appropriate amount of PM?\n- What training is required of the workforce?\n- What technical or system changes are required?\n- How will the unionized workforce respond?\nKey takeaways:\nThis case can prove to be lengthy and very involved. It is not expected that a candidate would\ncover all of the above topics, but rather work through selected topics in a logical fashion. It is\nimportant that the candidate pursue a solution that considers both revenue and cost issues to\nimpact profit. Additionally, a conadidate’s ability to work comfortably with the quantitative side\nof this case is important. The above recommendations for improving profitability are just a few\namong many. The candidate may come with their own ideas.",
  "Goizueta_2006_A.T.Kearney - Cookie Cutter": "A.T.Kearney - Cookie Cutter\nThis is not an officially recommended case from A.T.Kearney. It is only a sample practice case\nprovided by Vishy Padmanabhan, Goizueta MBA ‘04. A.T.Kearney uses a wide variety of cases\nin its interviews.\n- Your client is a U.S. based manufacturer of branded cookies (cookies that carry the name of\nthe manufacturer)\n- Recently private label cookies (those carrying the name of the retailer) have emerged and\nthreatened branded cookies\n- Private label cookies emerged five years ago\n- Two and one-half years ago they made up 10% of the overall cookie market (brand\nbeing the other 90%)\n- Today they make up approximately 20% of the overall cookie market (i.e., there has\nbeen a steady, linear increase of private label portion of the overall cookie market\nduring the past five years)\n- The overall cookie market has been relatively flat over the past five years\n- Private label cookies are made by the same manufacturers who make branded cookies, they\nare just sold under the name of the retailer\n- There are essentially three major competitors to consider:\n- Your client, who makes only branded cookies\n- A second major player, that makes both branded cookies and supplies cookies for\nprivate labelers\n- A collection of small outfits, that make both branded cookies and supply private\nlabelers\n- Distribution occurs primarily through one of two types of outlets:\n- Grocery outlets: all grocers sell branded cookies, most also carry their own private\nlabel cookies. This represents approximately 90% of total cookie sales\n- Mass merchandisers (ex. Walmart, Sam’s, etc.): sell only branded cookies\nHow large would you estimate the overall U.S. cookie market to be in terms of $?\nHow large of a threat do you believe the trend in private label cookie sales to be to your client?\nBased on your assessment, what is an appropriate strategy for your client to follow?\nSuggested solutions:\nThe first question, estimating the size of the U.S. cookie market, has no right or wrong answer. It\nis a test of a candidate’s ability to make reasonable assumptions and work quickly with numbers\non an “order of magnitude” level. One acceptable response would be to estimate the number of\nU.S. households, estimate household consumption over some period of time, estimate the\naverage cost of a bag of cookies, and project out for one year. In this case, after an estimate has\nbeen made, the candidate would be told to assume the market size is $1Billion to simplify any\nfuture calculations. As stated in the upfront information, the market is assumed to have been flat\nfor the past five years.\n\nThe second question is more involved. It involves determining to what extent your client is\nthreatened by the increasing percent of the overall cookie market represented by private label\nsales. To better answer this question information should be gathered pertaining to what is driving\nthe demand for private label cookies, to what extent this has already affected your client’s sales,\nand what the likelihood is for the trend to continue. The following are questions and answers\nthat would be provided in an interview scenario:\n- What are the sales trends for the client over the past five years?\n- Your client’s sales have been flat at $600M for the time frame of five to two and one-\nhalf years ago. Over the past two and one-half years, sales have decreased steadily\ndown to a present level of $560MM.\n- How has market share of the private label segment been split over the past five years between\nyour client’s main competitor and the other smaller players?\n- The smaller players combined had 100% of the private label subsegment five years\nago. Two and one-half years ago your client’s main competitor began supplying\nprivate labelers. Today, this main competitor owns 40% of the private label\nsubsegment, the smaller players own the remaining 60%\n- How has market share of the branded segment been split over the past five years?\n- Your client held 60% of this segment five years ago, 67% two and one-half years ago\nand 70% today. Its main competitor held 30% five years ago, 25% two and one-half\nyears ago and 23% today. The combined smaller players owned 10% five years ago,\n8% two and one-half years ago and 7% today.\nAnalysis of the above information tells a very important story. The private label segment was\nlaunched five years ago by the smaller players. As private label first cut into the branded\nsegment, it came at the expense of your client’s main competitor and the smaller players, not\nyour client. In response to this, your client’s main competitor entered into the private label\nsegment two and one-half years ago. This further hurt their own sales and those of the smaller\nplayers, but also began to hurt your client’s sales. Additional information is required to\nunderstand what is driving the demand for private label cookies\n- How does the quality of a private label cookie compare to that of a branded cookie?\n- Consumer studies have shown that there is a noticeable difference in taste, texture and\nquality in favor of the branded cookies\n- At the manufacturing level, what is the difference in cost of production and price between\nbranded and private label products?\n- It costs approximately $1.50 to manufacture a bag of private label cookies which will\nsell for $2.00 to retailers. It costs approximately $2.00 to manufacture a bag of\nbranded cookies which will sell for $2.75.\n- How do the same numbers translate at the retail level?\n- A retailer, paying $2.00 for private label cookies can sell that product for $2.50. The\n$2.75 bag of branded cookies can be sold for $3.50.\nThe key finding is that from a cost-price-margin perspective it is advantageous for both the\nmanufacturers and the retailers, with all else equal, to sell a bag of branded cookies. Other\nfactors must be contributing to the demand for private label cookies. Think about the incentives\nat each level in the chain (manufacturer, retailer, consumer). The following questions can help\nfill in details\":\n\n- Have any of the manufacturers been able to gain additional shelf space for branded products\nby supplying grocers with private label products?\n- No\n- Has their been excess capacity at your client, its main competitor or the smaller competitors\nthat has been used up through the manufacturing of private label products?\n- There was some excess capacity at the smaller competitors and your client’s main\ncompetitor (your client is unsure as to how much).. There is little excess capacity\nanywhere in the industry today.\n- Has your client’s relationship with its retailers suffered as a result of it not supplying private\nlabel products?\n- Not noticeably\n- Are grocery stores using private labels in other food categories?\n- Yes, there has been a major push by grocery stores to populate shelves with private\nlabels\n- Is competition increasing or decreasing among grocers?\n- Generally increasing. Grocer chains are expanding and the number of grocers to be\nfound serving a given area has generally increased over the past five years\n- What general macroeconomic trends have occurred over the past five years?\n- The economy has been slowing over the past five years. There is concern about\nrecession\nThe above information begins to expose a clearer story. A number of factors have contributed to\nthe emergence of the private label segment: manufacturer’s interest in utilizing excess capacity,\ngrocer’s desire to sell products with their name on it (they may believe this creates return\ncustomers in an increasing competitive environment), consumers concerns about a troubled\neconomy (price vs. quality tradeoffs).\nAt this point the candidate would be encouraged to state what they believe the magniturde of the\nprivate label threat to be to the client. There is no right answer. One can argue either way.\nIf the threat is seen as high, the likely recommendation is for your client to begin supplying\nprivate label products. The candidate should recognize that in competing in the private label\nsegment, the basis of competition is primarily cost. At the same time, the client’s branded\nproduct should be protected. The following tactics might prove appropriate:\n- Seek to wring costs out of all phases of the operation\n- Utilize all existing excess capacity\n- Gain maximum product knowledge as quickly as possible\n- Understand low cost positions on product ingredients and mix\n- Review process improvement/ manufacturing efficiency opportunities\n- Undertake overhead reduction efforts\n(Any of these points could be discussed in great detail)\n- Ensure there is no customer confusion between private label offering and branded product\n- Seek partnering agreements with retailers\n- Joint advertising and promotions\n- Explore deals with mass merchandisers to enter private labels (remember, mass\nmerchandisers presently sell no private label)\n\nIf the threat is seen as low, the likely recommendation is for your client to stay with branded\ncookies only. The candidate should recognize that in competing in the branded segment the basis\nof competition is one of differentiation. Additionally, your client should do all it can to halt or\nreverse the momentum of the private label segment. The following tactics might prove useful:\n- Pursue a maximum differentiation strategy\n- Invest in brand image to support premium price\n- Make it difficult to copy product: innovate wisely through product advances, smart\nproduct line extensions, frequent changes to the product\n- Manage price gap: explore price increases where appropriate\n- ( Again, any of these points could be discussed in great detail)\n- Explore exclusive partnering with mass merchandisers\n- Consider alternative distribution channels\n- Seek partnering agreements with grocers regarding branded products\n- Educate grocers as available\n- Customers who buy private labels are the most price sensitive. They also tend to be\nthe least loyal customers and spend less per store visit.\n- Grocer's financial stake in private label products extends beyond the product margins.\nThere is lost profit from branded products that could occupy the same shelf space,\nadvertising costs of the private label products, etc.\nKey takeaways:\nThis case has no right or wrong answer. It forces the candidate to take a stand in a “grey”\nsituation and defend it. It also provides a large amount of data upfront which the candidate must\nquickly sort through and determine what is important and what is not. The key is to understand\nthe story behind the data. How did the private label segment emerge? What is driving it? How\nhas it affected manufacturers, retailers and consumers?",

A.T.Kearney uses a wide variety of cases\nin its interviews.\n- Your client is a U.S. based oil refinery\n- The refinery has a single location and is a small to medium-sized refinery\n- Your client, although profitable, believes it is lagging behind the competition and could\nimprove\n- You are brought in as part of a joint consultant-client team that will review overall operations\nand make recommendations on ways to improve the bottom line\n- You have been assigned to work with the maintenance division\n- The maintenance department’s primary objective is to prevent equipment failure and to repair\nequipment when it does fail\n- Understanding of its organization is important. It consists of three primary areas: nine assets\nareas, one central maintenance area and one group of contractors. The first two areas are\nemployees of the client, the third an external source of labor.\n- An asset is a physical area of the plant that contains various pieces of equipment\n(pumps, heat exchangers, etc.). There are nine assets. Each asset has a Maintenance\nSupervisor who is responsible for all maintenance to be performed in his/her asset.\nWorking for the Maintenance Supervisor in each asset is, on average, eleven\n“craftsmen”. The craftsmen are the actual workers that perform the maintenance. The\ncraftsmen are unionized and divide into twelve different craft designations (e.g.\nelectricians, pipefitters, welders, etc.). Each craft designation has a defined set of\nskills they are qualified to perform. They are not allowed to perform skills outside of\ntheir defined craft, or help in the performance of activities involving skills beyond\ntheir craft. Collectively the twelve different crafts can perform any maintenance job\nthat might arise at the refinery. The maintenance supervisor and his/her assigned\ncraftsmen are “hardwired” to their asset. That is, they work only on equipment in\ntheir given asset.\n- Central maintenance is a centralized pool of Maintenance Supervisors and Craftsmen,\nwho are dispatched to support the different assets during times of high workload.\nThey are employees of your client and fit the description contained in the above Asset\nexplanation. The only difference is that they may work in any of the different assets\nas determined by workload. There are a total of 11 Maintenance Supervisors and 100\nCraftsmen that comprise Central Maintenance\n- Contractors are a group of outside Supervisors and Craftsmen who support your\nclient during times of high workload. They also are capable of performing any\nmaintenance job that may arise, but differ from your client’s Craftsmen in that they\ndivide the collective skills required into five designations rather than twelve. Thus,\nthe craftsmen of the contractor are capable of performing a broader set of skills. They,\nlike your client’s craftsmen, don’t perform skills outside of their defined craft but do\nallow different craft designations to help each other. There are an average of 7\ncontractor Maintenance Supervisors and 140 contractor Craftsmen at the refinery on\nany given day.\n\nWhat opportunities exist to increase profits?\nWhat recommendations can you make to capture savings related to the identified opportunities?\nWhat are the cost savings associated with your recommendations?\nSuggested solutions:\nThe first question involves identifying opportunities to improve profits. The candidate must start\nwith either revenues or costs. Although one could make the argument that maintenance supports\nrevenue by maximizing the operating time of the refinery equipment, maintenance should be\nseen to be a support function. Thus, it is more appropriate to focus on costs and cost reduction.\nThe following questions will help the candidate gain insight into cost reduction opportunities.\n- How does the maintenance department track its costs?\n- If the candidate phrases the question about material or overhead costs, the interviewer\nwould inform the candidate that detailed reviewed showed no major opportunities. The\ncandidate would be steered toward labor costs and given the following tables regarding\nmaintenance labor costs for the past year.\n- To support understanding of the following tables, Turnaround work is long term preventive\nmaintenance (e.g. complete rebuilding of a boiler) that may be performed once every few\nyears. All other work (short term emergency repairs, small scale preventive maintenance,\nother routine work, etc.) fits into the category of Daily work\nCraftsmen Daily work Turnaround Total\nClient $ 8MM $ 2MM $ 10MM\nContractor $ 5MM $ 9MM $ 14MM\nTotal $ 13MM $ 11MM $ 24MM\nSupervisor Total\nClient $ 1MM\nContractor $ 0.5MM\nTotal $ 1.5MM\nSince the Craftsmen table represents a larger dollar amount than the Supervisor table, it is logical\nto pursue cost savings opportunities in this area first.\n- What is the utilization of Craftsmen in the assets? In central maintenance? And for\ncontractors?\n- Assume each area is utilized 100% of the time, 50 weeks per year, 40 hours per week.\n- How does the labor cost of craftsmen ($24MM) on a refinery-sized basis (i.e., $cost / per\nbarrel of crude oil processed) compare with industry averages?\n- Consulting your industry data base shows that costs appear to be about 20% above the\naverage of peer refineries.\n- This is an important question to determine if there is a problem with costs (don’t\nassume there is, the client may be performing better than industry average!)\n\n- Is there any particular reason why turnaround work is so heavily skewed toward contractors?\n- Turnaround work tends to be more cyclical. An external workforce is used to absorb\nsome of this additional work. Keep in mind that both client and contractor Craftsmen\nare capable of performing any maintenance job at the plant.\nAfter further analysis of the tables the key fact that should become appear odd is the large\ndifference in the cost per unit of labor between your client’s Craftsmen and the outside\ncontractor’s Craftsmen. Often candidates will ask for the hourly wage rates of these two groups.\nThere is sufficient data to calculate these numbers. The calculation is:\nAnnual cost of client craftsmen\n= $10MM/ ( 11 Craftsmen/asset x 9 assets + 100 Craftsmen in Central maintenance)\n= $50,000 / year\nAnnual cost of contractor craftsmen\n= $ 14 MM/ 140 contractor Craftsmen\n= $100,000 / year\nAgain, this difference should provoke a series of questions to understand the difference.\n- Is there any difference in the work performed by the client and contractor craftsmen?\n- No, other than the different levels of Turnaround work vs. Daily work performed as\nnoted in the previous table. Both groups are capable of doing any job with roughly\nequal levels of quality.\n- Is there any difference in efficiency between the two groups of Craftsmen?\n- The candidate would at this point be asked how they would measure this.\n- After reaching an understanding of the difficulty involved in measuring the efficiency\nof a workforce (especially a unionized workforce), the candidate would be told that\nthrough a series of interviews with maintenance supervisors, there is a consensus that\ncontractor Craftsmen are roughly twice as productive as client craftsmen.\nThis is a critical point in the case. The candidate must recognize that in the present environment\nthe client is largely indifferent about units of labor. You can have a client worker who is half as\nefficient or a contractor worker who is twice as expensive. The key now is to determine if there\nare ways to create an opportunity where the client would no longer be indifferent.\n- What is causing the inefficiencies associated with the client’s labor?\n- Again, the candidate would be encouraged to offer their own ideas.\n- After some discussion the candidate would be told that many of the Maintenance\nSupervisors complain endlessly about restrictions placed on them by the existing\nunion labor contract and the tightness of craft designations.\n- The interviewer would probe to ensure the candidate understands why the present\ncraft designation create the inefficiencies. Essentially work is too finely divided. It\nmakes planning and supervision extremely cumbersome. As an example, if one of six\ncrafts required to perform a job is absent or late, the entire job must shut down, as\ncraft designations are not allowed to support other craft designations.\n- Is it possible to change the existing union contract?\n\n- The present labor contract is a three year contract that is due to be\nrenegotiated/renewed in six months.\n- Will the union resist changes to the existing contract?\n- Indeed!!\nAt this point, the candidate should recognize a major (albeight difficult) opportunity to reduce\nlabor costs. The client would essentially like to have its own employees look and function like its\ncontractors, but continue to get paid at present rates. In reality, management will need to make\nwage concessions in order to change present work practices. However, through planned\nnegotiations a scenario can be created which presents a favorable opportunity for your client to\nbegin to replace outside contractors with its own Craftsmen.\nThere are several ways to address the third question of the case, the actual savings that might be\nachieved. One quick method is to assume that these changes would bring maintenance costs\nback in line with industry average. Utilizing the cost benchmark mentioned earlier, one could\nassume costs could be reduced to $24MM/1.20 = $20MM, a $4MM savings.\nA second, and more detailed, method would be to take the extreme scenario where the client’s\nCraftsmen is paid its present rate, but is made as efficient as the contractor’s Craftsmen. In this\ncase, you begin with the present level of 200 client craftsmen who are functioning as 100\nequivalent contractor Craftsmen (they’re one-half as efficient). By improving their efficiency,\nyou are effectively “creating” 100 equivalent contractors. Thus, you are immediately able to\nreplace 100 contractors and save $10MM. This could be taken one step further by assuming you\nwould want to replace all contractors. This would save an additional $2.5MM ($4MM existing\ncontractor expense - $2MM required to hire additional client craftsmen + $0.5MM in contractor\nsupervisors). As noted earlier, in reality, this approach would require wage concessions to the\nunion, so actual savings may be something significantly less.\nKey takeaways:\nThis case requires the candidate to quickly digest a large amount of organizational issues and\nthen quickly check some ratios to uncover the basic problem (the client workforce is inefficient).\nCreativity must then be used to structure a recommendation that would create a more favorable\nsituation for the client. As in other cases, acceptable solutions need not follow the exact method\nabove nor cover all of the above points.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Bain - Food services costs": "Bain - Food services costs\nQuestion 1\nThe client situation:\nA large fast food chain has hired Bain to improve the company’s profitability. You’re about to\nhave an initial brainstorming session with your team around your client’s options, and you want\nto collect your thoughts first.\nHow would you begin to tackle your client’s profitability problem?\nRecommended answer:\nYour interviewer wants to know that you have a structure in mind. An appropriate structure for\nthis case would be the profit equation. Be sure to state that to your interviewer.\nFor example:\n\"Profit is: total revenue – total cost.\nWhere Revenue = Price * Quantity and Costs = Fixed Costs + Quantity * (Variable Costs).\nIn order for the company to improve its profitability, management needs to increase revenues\nand/or decrease costs.\nSo to begin tackling my client’s profit problem I am going to look at these two sides of the\nequation:\n- Could the client increase prices? How would customers react?\n- Could the client sell more meals, either at existing branches or through opening new ones?\n- Are there other creative ways to grow revenue (enter into large-scale catering contracts, for\nexample)?\n- Could the client decrease our fixed costs by selling some of our branches or real estate?\n- Could the client reduce the quantity of products they buy, such as ingredients for their meals?\n- How else could they reduce their costs?\"\nQuestion 2\nAt your case team meeting, your manager informs the team the customer is price sensitive, the\nmarket is fairly saturated, and that the fixed costs are pretty stable. Thus Bain and the client\nagree that the team should focus on lowering variable costs. Specifically the client wants to\nreduce their spending on purchased items (items the client buys from others and then uses or\noffers to their customers, like the meat in the hamburgers or the ketchup packets).\nWithout knowing much more about the situation, what would you suggest are some ways to do\nso? Which ideas seem the most attractive and why?\n\nRecommended answer:\nPurchased goods in this business fall primarily into 2 categories: food and packaging. Variable\ncosts are a function of: price and volume. Therefore, the client needs to reduce volumes\npurchased or negotiate lower prices.\nFood:\n- We could negotiate lower food prices with our suppliers (consolidate our purchasing, etc.).\n- We could look for cheaper ingredients. This sounds risky because it could lower the quality of\nthe food that we sell.\n- We could reduce the volume used. For the same reason, this sounds risky because it would\nchange our recipes, one of our competitive advantages in producing winning recipes.\nPackaging:\n- We could negotiate lower prices with our suppliers or look for cheaper alternatives.\n- We could reduce the volume used.\nRecommendation:\n- Most attractive ideas are: negotiating lower food prices or packaging prices, looking for\ncheaper packaging materials, or reducing the volume used.\nQuestion 3\nAt this point in the brainstorming session, the VP adds that two years ago, the company launched\na program to centralize purchasing and successfully negotiated much lower prices. Therefore, it\nis critical to determine if you could reduce the volume of goods that the client purchases. How\ncould you reduce the volume of purchased goods?\nRecommended answer:\n- Some good creative answers here include (but are in no way limited to):\n- Can the client change the shape or size of food containers?\n- Can the client packaging for families be consolidated?\n- Can the client reduce the weight of the packaging while still protecting the food?\n- Can the client reduce other qualities of the packaging including degree of color or logo\nprevalence without sacrificing their brand?\n- Can the client lock bathrooms so that non-customers do not waste toilet paper and towels?\n- Can the client charge for extra condiments?\n- Can the client reduce the size or number of napkins they purchase?\nQuestion 4\nBain focuses on components that make up large portions of a company’s costs: reductions in\nthese areas will have the largest impact on a client’s overall costs. Bain’s philosophy is to always\nfocus on where the value is. At first glance, napkins would not appear to fall within this category\nbecause they are so low cost. But there is a new napkin dispensing technology on the market that\nyou have heard about and think could save the client some money. You decide to investigate.\n\nOne way to reduce volume is to reduce how many napkins a customer takes.\nCustomers in fast food chains often take many more napkins than are needed for the meal, or\nactively hoard them to take home. One action some chains have taken to combat this is to switch\ntheir napkin dispensers from small metal dispensers (from which you pull napkins out in\nbunches) to larger plastic dispensers (from which you pull napkins one at a time, like a reverse\nKleenex box). These dispensers are produced by major paper manufacturers.\nLet’s assume your chain came to you with the following question:\n- How much money could we save per year in the US from using the new type of napkin\ndispenser in all restaurants?\nWhat information would you like to know from the company? (Do not take into account the cost\nof the dispensers for now.)\nRecommended answer:\nKey information that would be necessary includes:\n- Number of restaurants\n- Number of customer visits per store per year\n- Number of napkins used per customer now\n- Number of napkins used per customer after the switch\n- Price per napkin\nQuestion 5\nAs you talk through the data points that you would need to gather with your colleagues, you\nlearn from a fellow AC who worked for a local restaurant that a case of 6000 napkins cost his\nclient $28. Thus, a reasonable price per napkin is about $0.005.\nConduct your estimates as if your client is similar to McDonald's in terms of the number of\noutlets.\nYour manager calls you for a quick estimation of the market size before getting the actual data\nfrom your client. Use creative approaches to hypothesize values for each of the above pieces of\ninformation and then calculate the estimated savings.\nRecommended answer:\nThe interviewer is not looking for you to know the values of each of these buckets, however it is\nimportant for you to make reasonable estimates and be able to defend your answer. Were your\nestimates near these, or did you at least take similar approaches?\nNumber of restaurants\nActual answer: ~12,000 McDonald's in the US.\nOne estimation approach:\n\nThink of your hometown: How many McDonald's are there for the number of people? Assume\nthere is a McDonald's for every 20-25,000 Americans, with a population of ~275 million people\nin the US, that would be 11-13,750 McDonald's.\nOther approaches:\n- Estimate the entire fast food market and then estimate McDonald's share\n- Estimate the area covered per McDonald's across the United States.\nNote: With this approach, be careful to account for population differences between 10 square\nmiles of NYC and 10 square miles of Utah.\nNumber of customers per restaurant per day\nActual answer: Fast food restaurants expect around 1,500 customers a day.\nOne estimation approach:\nAssume the 20,000 people per McDonald's visit an average of twice a month, that's 24 times a\nyear per customer or 480,000 visits / 365 days = 1,315 customers per day.\nOther approaches:\nOne might take this a step further during a case interview and attempt to segment these\ncustomers. For example, one might assume 50% of the restaurants customers are drive-through\nand 25% of the remaining take their food \"to go.\" Drive-through customers do not take, but are\ngiven napkins. \"To go\" customers may be more likely to \"hoard napkins\" as they can not go back\nto the counter for more.\nNote: This would influence potential answers to the next question - but for now, assume you did\nnot take this step and all customers are the same.\nNumber of napkins used per customer per visit\nActual answer: Five napkins with old dispensers and two napkins with prohibitive dispensers for\na savings of three napkins per customer.\nOne estimation approach:\nDuring a case interview you would most likely just use personal experience here - how many\nnapkins do you take or see others take when you're at a fast food restaurant?\nOther approaches:\nBain would send people to the chain to watch napkin taking behavior or call fast food restaurants\nwith both kinds of dispensers to find out how many napkins they go through a day.\nCalculations\n$0.005 per napkin x 3 napkins x 1500 customers x 365 days per year x 12,000 restaurants\n= $98.6M dollars saved in napkin purchases.\nQuestion 6\n\nDoes this estimate sound reasonable?\n- How would you go about feeling comfortable with this figure and pressure checking your\nassumptions?\n- What would you want to flag for your manager as factors that might significantly alter the\nanswer?\nRecommended answer:\nTo check the magnitude of the overall number some options include:\n- Looking at a comparable company’s operating income to see what percentage of the expense\nnapkins account for.\n- Find out what your client currently spends per restaurant per year on napkins.\nKeep in mind that with a company of this size any small changes in assumptions will\nsignificantly alter your answer. Some things to flag for your manager:\n- The chain you work for probably gets a significantly better deal on napkin pricing due to the\nmagnitude of their orders (in contrast to the single-location restaurant napkin price estimate\nyou received)\n- Up to 50% of customers are drive-through and their napkin behavior should not change. This\nwould reduce the savings by up to 50%\n- The three napkin reduction estimate needs refining. Perhaps a pilot program would need to be\ndone to see if the dispensers really have the desired effect\nQuestion 7\nAssume you would need 10 dispensers per store for a total of 120,000 dispensers. Also note that\nnapkins in these dispensers cost more at a price of $.01 per napkin (remember it is the paper\ncompanies that make the new dispensers).\nAt what price per dispenser would the investment not be worth doing?\nRecommended answer:\n120,000 x cost of dispenser + 2 napkins x .$01 per napkin x 1,500 customers x 365 days x\n12,000 stores\n= 5 napkins x .005 per napkin x 1,500 customers x 365 days x 12,000 stores\n120,000 x cost of dispenser = $32.85M\nThe most you would be willing to pay per dispenser would be $273.\nNote: In an actual case interview you can use round number estimates so that mental math is\neasier.\nQuestion 8\nThe actual cost of these dispensers is around $50.\n- Can you see any other factors your client should consider before making a decision?\n\n- What other advantages and disadvantages might there be to this switch? (Impact on costs and\ncustomers.)\n- How might you evaluate the impact of the extraneous factors?\nRecommended answer:\nSome potential ideas include:\nAdvantages:\nFewer napkins used per day leads to less restocking which may mean better customer service or\nlower labor cost. Better relationship with paper manufacturer (potential for better pricing).\nDisadvantages:\nWith the new dispenser locking you into a paper provider you may lose buyer power. There is\nthe potential for additional napkin price increases in the future.\nCustomer reaction: Will a customer find this to be poor service? What if he or she needs to grab\na handful of napkins after a spill?\nImplementation:\nManagement will need to negotiate a contract that includes limits on future pricing.\nBain will need to do customer research and pilot programs to evaluate customer reaction.\nAnd many, many more! As you can see, the keys to a good case interview are logical\nassumptions, creative thinking, and basic quantitative ability. Take time to think through\nproblems and share your thought process with your interviewer and you will do great.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Bain - Giant Bank": "Bain - Giant Bank\nOur client, Giant Bank is one of the \"big 4\" banks in Australia. These 4 banks account for about\n75% of the retail/commercial banking revenue in Australia and are roughly equal in size.Giant\nBank does not have a good understanding of the profitability of its retail customer base, and\nmore specifically individual segments.One segment that has been of particular concern to them is\nthe \"youth\" customer segment. This group encompasses all customers under the age of 22.\nGiant Bank wants Bain to help answer two questions:\nQuestion 1: What is the average annual profit of a Youth customer?\nQuestion 2: What should Giant Bank's strategy be to maximize long term profits for this\ncustomer segment?\nTo answer these questions, you'll first need to collect data and conduct analysis. Please rate the\nfollowing facts/issues based on their importance in helping you answer the two questions.\nImportance\nVery Somewhat Not\nSize and growth- Australian retail banking industry\nNet interest margin across Giant's products\nCustomer purchase criteria (youth segment)\nProducts purchased and avg. balances (youth segment)\nFee structure for Giant's products\nMonthly Transaction log history (all segments)\nBranch infrastructure and location\nNumber of customers across each segment for Giant\nNumber of products for an avg. customer (all segments)\nDefection rates (across customer segments)\nDefection rate by age (youth segment)\nCost structure for Giant Bank\n\nImportance\nVery Somewhat Not\nSize and growth- Australian retail banking industry\nNet interest margin across Giant's products\nCustomer purchase criteria (youth segment)\nProducts purchased and avg. balances (youth segment)\nFee structure for Giant's products\nMonthly Transaction log history (all segments)\nBranch infrastructure and location\nNumber of customers across each segment for Giant\nNumber of products for an avg. customer (all segments)\nDefection rates (across customer segments)\nDefection rate by age (youth segment)\nCost structure for Giant Bank\nThus the loss per customer is $64\n\nQuestion 2: What should Giant Bank's strategy be to maximize long term profits for this\ncustomer segment?\nTo respond to Question 2, please rate the following actions/initiatives for their potential to\nimprove the profitability of this segment.\nRating\nGood Potential Bad\nRaise/Introduce Fees\nRedirect customers to cheaper channels\nShut down unprofitable branches\nAttract more youth customers through marketing\nEstablish partnerships with elementary/middle schools\nAggressively cross sell other products into customer\nbase\nRemove ATM charges to attract more customers\nAsk the customer to leave\nAcquire another bank to increase economies of scale\nGood Idea\n- Raise/Introduce fees\n- Raising/introducing fees accomplishes two objectives a) increase revenue from this\ncustomer segment and b) if done correctly, can influence behavior positively e.g.\nreduce branch visits by charging for transactions.\n- Giant Bank needs to be careful about how to do this however, to ensure that it doesn’t\nlose too many customers. While these customers are negative profit, they are likely\npositive contribution given the bulk of the costs are fixed. Thus, Giant Bank should\nraise/introduce fees that either are in line with the market, or is likely something the\nother 3 banks will follow.\n- Redirect customers to cheaper channels\n- Channel costs vary significantly. Branch costs (the most expensive) can be 10x-100x\nmore expensive than cheaper channels (e.g. internet transactions can be < $0.01 fully\ncosted).\n- Many customers will migrate to cheaper channels if the appropriate mix of positive\nand negative reinforcement are applied. Positive reinforcement includes education\nand making the channel easy to use (e.g. secure and easy login for internet access).\nNegative reinforcement usually comes in the form of fees.\nHas Potential\n- Shut down unprofitable branches\n- At the end of the day, this is where the bulk of cost reduction is going to come from.\nHowever, it is unlikely that Giant Bank has branches which are predominately\n“Youth” customers. Thus, analysis across all segments need to be conducted before\nan identification of specific branches to shut down can be made.\n\n- This analysis will likely be an overall “footprint” analysis of branches quantifying\nprofitability, contribution, and customer segments served.\n- Aggressively cross sell other products\n- It is clear from the data that the number of products that this customer segment owns\nis significantly less than other segments (except for Community). One high potential\nis credit cards.\n- However, it is highly likely that this customer segment doesn’t need any of the other\nproducts that Giant Bank has to offer. Thus aggressively cross selling may be futile.\nFurther analysis will be required before this action can be recommended. While cross\nselling has been a hot topic for financial institutions, the results to date have been\ndisappointing.\n- Attract more youth customers through marketing\n- Giant Bank should not want any more of these customers, and certainly shouldn’t\nspend marketing dollars to acquire more of these customers. However, there is an\nexception to selectively target older, educated customers in this segment (e.g. 21/22\nyear old college graduates) who will likely be profitable future customers for the bank.\n- Timing is critical here however…too soon and Giant bank stands to lose money for\nmany years before being able to recoup its investment, and there is no guarantee that\nthe customer will not defect once he becomes profitable.\nBad Idea\n- Establish partnerships with elementary/middle schools\n- While this may be a laudable activity (I.e. teach children the fundamentals about\nbanking and saving), it is sure to be a money losing proposition. It certainly doesn’t\nhelp improve the profitability of the segment. In fact, this will likely drag the\nprofitability of the segment down as the average age of the group falls and financial\nservices needs dwindle.\n- Remove ATM charges to attract more customers\n- This will likely attract even more money losing customers to Giant bank as well as\nremove revenues necessary to pay other banks for network usage. This\nrecommendation would be a huge mistake.\n- Ask customer to leave\n- Besides the negative impression this is likely to make on your customers, this action\nis difficult to implement. It is far easier to increase fees/pricing to influence a bad\ncustomer to leave, rather than trying to do this through direct communications.\n- Acquire another bank to increase economies of scale\n- Given the situation in Australia, acquisition of any of the other 3 banks will be\ndifficult due to anti-trust considerations. However, there may be opportunities with\nsome of the smaller regional banks.\n- Realistically though, there may not be a lot of synergies due to the integration\nchallenges likely to be faced, and the fact that the remaining players are so small.\n- Also, while this recommendation has potential to improve the overall profitability of\nthe bank, it doesn’t address the question of improving the profitability of this\nparticular segment.",
  "Goizueta_2006_BCG - Trevor's Toys": "BCG - Trevor's Toys\nYou have been assigned to work on a product-offering strategy case for Trevor's Toys, Inc. Your\nteam has been asked to deliver a recommendation quickly: you have only 12 weeks (or 60\nworking days) to complete the project. You must use your time wisely if you’re to deliver\nmaximum value for Trevor's Toys.\nTrevor's Toys is a regional toy retailer focused on the high-tech toy market in the United States.\nIt generated $600 million in revenue last year from 30 stores located primarily in urban areas\nthroughout the Northeast and the Midwest. Management has considered expanding its product\noffering to include low-tech toys a number of times, but has never been convinced that it was\nmaking a fully informed decision. Revenue growth for the company has historically been strong,\nalthough it has slowed in the last few years.\nTrevor's Toys' competitors include traditional toy stores and online Web sites that sell both high-\ntech and low-tech toys, some of which are quite large and utilize both sales channels.\nManagement is concerned that the continued growth of the large traditional stores and online\ntoys sites will erode its customer base over time unless Trevor's offers a full selection of toys.\nYour task is to analyze the decision facing management at Trevor's Toys. Your first step is to\nframe your analysis, decide which aspects of it are most important, and then ask questions about\nthe most relevant topics.

Given their wider selection\nof toys, larger size, and lower prices, those stores will continue to be a major draw for many of\nTrevor's customers.\nWhat do customers like about shopping at Trevor's?\nMost customers surveyed cited the knowledgeable and friendly sales staff, good selection of\nhigh-tech toys, ease of store navigation and relatively short lines, and lack of any \"feeding\nfrenzy\" atmosphere as their primary reasons for shopping at Trevor's. Also, Trevor's recently put\nin a rating system for its toys and games to help parents better understand the violence level of\nthe toys they are buying. Interestingly, many customers said they had a relatively clear idea of\nwhat they hoped to buy when they came to the store.\nWhy do customers shop at larger toy stores? What do they like/dislike?\nThe most common response to why customers shop at the large stores was that these stores had\nthe widest selection of high- and low-tech toys. In addition, many people said they often went to\nthe larger stores with less idea about what they were going to purchase and would go with their\nkids and spend more time browsing the aisles to make their selection. However, a number of\nrespondents mentioned that they disliked these stores because of the large crowds and long lines\nthat are almost always present.\nHow loyal are Trevor's customers? Are many sales repeat sales to the same customers?\n\nMost of Trevor's customers are fairly loyal to the company and visit the store, on average, three\ntimes a year.\nDo customers shop online for toys? Why? For what kinds of toys?\nYes, a number of customers shop online. For the most part, people purchase online for the\nconvenience of not having to visit the store. The amounts of high-tech and low-tech toys sold\nonline are roughly equal and are expected to remain so for the next few years. An exit survey at a\nnumber of Trevor's stores revealed that only 20 percent of Trevor's current customers shop\nonline.\nWho are Trevor's Toys' traditional competitors?\nThe biggest traditional store competitors are Toys R Us and the large discount stores, like Wal-\nMart, J.C. Penney, and Target. They each have hundreds of stores nationwide. Each of these\nstores sells a small selection of very competitively priced SKUs, which Trevor's Toys also\ncarries. Trevor's Toys differs by offering a wider product range and narrower geographic\ncoverage. Trevor's Toys is located only in the U.S. Northeast and Midwest. No one else offers\nthe same variety and depth of product.\nWhat do competitors offer that we can't?\nThe large competitors offer a great variety of toys in all product categories. The competitors also\nhave national coverage. Currently, Trevor's Toys does not serve customers outside its store\nregions.\nWhat are the competitors' growth rates?\nThe large stores (Toys R Us and Wal-Mart) have been seeing 3 percent and 7 percent growth in\nthis category over the past few years. The pure-play online toy retailers have been growing at\nvery high rates of between 75 percent and 150 percent per year since they began operation in\n1996. BrainSmart and SmartKids are both private companies (revenue numbers aren't publicly\navailable), but growth estimates for both are in the range of 50 percent to 100 percent since\nstartup, though from a much smaller starting base.\nWhat are the competitors' pricing policies?\nToys R Us and Wal-Mart have been in a prolonged battle for low prices, particularly for low-\ntech toys. Historically, both have been known to make certain popular toys loss leaders to drive\ntraffic into the store and encourage people to buy higher-margin products. The online sites such\nas Amazon.com and eToys price their product in a similar way.\nWho are the market share leaders in the total toy market?\nToys R Us, the historical market share leader, has 25% of the total toy market, but has recently\nbeen surpassed by Wal-Mart, which has 30%. None of the other retailers have more than 8%.\nTrevor's Toys currently has 3% of the market overall and 10% of the high tech toy market.\nWhat is the additional revenue per customer projected if Trevor's expands its product offering?\nThis can be broken down into two components: 1) The 1.6 million existing Trevor's customers\nare projected to spend approximately $135 per visit (up from $125 now). These customers\ngenerally visit the store three times per year, on average, and will continue to do so. 2) In\n\naddition, Trevor's hopes to attract about 500,000 new customers who will visit the twice a year\nand spend $40 per visit.\nHow much additional retail space would be needed? Is it available? How much would it cost?\nEach store is approximately 3,000 square feet and would need to be tripled to accommodate the\nincreased inventory. The current store base is mainly in traditional and strip malls, where space\nis relatively limited, and rent averages approximately $50 per square foot.\nWould additional staff be needed?\nYes. Though the warehouses might need to add a few people, the majority of additional staff\nwould be needed in retail operations. Trevor's estimates that each of its 30 stores would probably\nrequire five new staff. The standard cost for a retail employee, including training and health care,\nis $40,000 per year.\nWould the company need additional warehouse space? If so, how much would this space cost?\nThe company currently leases four warehouses (two each in the Northeast and the Midwest).\nEach warehouse is approximately 75,000 square feet, and management estimates that it would\nneed to triple the size of each one to make room for the low-tech toys. The current warehouses\nare in relatively cheap locations; additional space is available at $2 per square foot.\nOn average, what are the margins on low and high-tech toys?\nOn average, low-tech toys have a gross margin per item of about 15 percent and high-tech toys\nabout 20 percent. Both of these numbers vary widely from item to item, however, given the\npricing policies of most retailers.\nWhat is the overall size of the toy market?\nApproximately $30 billion is spent annually in all toy categories in the U.S.\nWhat is the size of the high tech toy market?\nApproximately $10 billion is spent annually on high tech toys (including video games) in the U.S.\nHow fast has the toy market grown over the past five years?\nThe overall toy category has been growing at 6 percent annually over the last five years.\nHow fast has the high tech toy market grown over the past five years?\nThe high tech toy market has been growing at 20% annually over the past five years. Projections\nare that the number of high tech toys bought online will grow faster than the number of\ntraditional toys.\nWhy is the toy market growing so fast?\nThe likely reason is that the amount of disposable income for parents and teenagers has been\nincreasing consistently in recent years. There is no conclusive proof of this rationale.\nWhere would Trevor's Toys source the low-tech toys?\nThe new venture into low-tech toys would require Trevor's to form relationships with a large\nnumber of toy manufacturers from which it does not now receive inventory. There are a number\n\nof large low-tech toy companies such as Mattel and Hasbro that Trevor's does not deal with now,\nbut would need to purchase from, if it moved into the low-tech toy market.\nAre the suppliers of low- and high-tech toys different?\nYes, many of the high-tech toy companies are large firms that produce video games as well as a\nhost of other products. This is in contrast to the low-tech toy companies, which are typically\nfocused mainly on the toy market.\nCan the current facilities be used for the sale of low-tech toys?\nYes, but only with additional space. The current inventory system could be expanded with little\neffort or expenditure to include the new toys to be stocked, but the warehouse and retail spaces\nwould need significant additions.\nHow does management at Trevor's Toys view the low-tech business as a competitive threat?\nMost of the senior managers view the low-tech business as something that could be an additional\nrevenue stream in the future. They realize that most of their key competitors currently sell both\nlow- and high-tech toys, but don't see the low-tech market as a threat to the high-tech market.\nThey believe that this is reflected in the different growth rates of the sectors.\nWould the current internal culture fit the venture into low-tech toys?\nMost of the front-line personnel are young, tech-savvy individuals. And although there is no\ndoubt that Trevor's will need to hire a number of front-line people to deal with the increased\nnumber of products, there is some concern that this will dilute the overall quality of the sales\nforce.\nDays Spent = 50\nShould Trevor's Toys go ahead with plans to offer low-tech toys?\nNo, avoid expanding into low-tech toys.\nRecommending that Trevor's Toys avoid expanding into low-tech toys is correct.\nA recommendation that Trevor's Toys avoid an entry into the low-tech toy market is likely to\nmeet with strong agreement and support from Trevor's Toys' senior management. An expansion\nof the current offering to include low-tech toys is unlikely to generate enough revenue to offset\nthe additional costs associated with the change. In addition, Trevor's may lose some customers\nwho no longer feel that Trevor's offers the same benefits as before, such as knowledgeable and\nfriendly customer service and a less hectic shopping experience than in the large stores.\nYour overall direction against an increased toy offering seems sound, but it is important to assure\nsenior management that the decision is defensible and the rationale is robust. There are five areas\nthat senior management and the directors would like to understand before they present the\nfindings to the board. Now you must develop recommendations for each of those areas based on\nthe information and data you gathered. Good luck.\n- What value would be created or destroyed for customers with a full toy offering at Trevor's?\n\n- How would competitors respond?\n- How attractive is the low-tech toy market?\n- Would Trevor's Toys make money?\n- What are the implementation issues?\nNow that you've performed your analysis, you need to integrate your information into a cohesive\nwhole. Often overlooked, this is a key aspect of every assignment. It's important to highlight the\nmain findings and show how they relate to each other. The way to begin is to decide whether\nTrevor's Toys should offer low-tech toys. To make this recommendation, you should revisit the\nquestions you asked and the analysis you performed to help you support your conclusions.\nWhat value will the customers get from an online offering?\nTrevor's Toys is unlikely to meet customers' needs by expanding its offering. First and foremost,\ndoing so might detract from the traditional shopping experience at Trevor's. Trevor's Toys is\nwidely recognized for its knowledgeable and friendly sales staff. If it increases the product\noffering, the company will have to hire more retail staff and may have problems finding the same\nquality of people. In addition, the increased customer traffic is likely to result in heavier crowds,\nlonger lines, and more stockouts. Management should be very wary of alienating its core\ncustomers given their loyalty to the stores, illustrated by their frequent visits (three times a year).\nFrom the questions you asked, it appears that you have a good grasp of the Trevor's Toys\ncustomer and how an expansion to low-tech toys might or might not appeal to them. You have\nanswered enough of the questions to sit with the senior management team and convince them\nthat they have enough informaiton to make a decision on whether or not to offer the low-tech\ntoys. You delved into the important customer needs and desires to better understand how a low-\ntech toys offering would address those needs.\nHow are the competitors positioned?\nBy expanding its offering, Trevor's would be going head-to-head with the two largest players,\nToys R Us and Wal-Mart. One or both of them might engage in a pricing war if they felt\nthreatened by the change. In addition, Trevor's would be competing with the online retailers that\nsell both low- and high-tech toys. Although online product selection is a key to success,\ncustomer service remains a significant differentiator, so there is less risk for the company in that\narea. The customer service levels at the big competitors range from low to medium and Trevor's\nwould have to be extremely careful not to let this area drop.\nThe two additional areas where Trevor's Toys is able to distinguish itself from the competitors\nare in offering a toy rating system and employing a knowledgeable sales staff. These factors are\nless relevant for low-tech toys and would not provide an edge over the competition\nYou have a reasonable understanding of the competition in the low-tech toy retailing industry.\nThere are a number of key competitive points you discovered that will help Trevor's Toys decide\nwhether or not to expand into low-tech toys. When asked by Trevor's Toys, you will be able to\nput together a compelling story of the competitive landscape and justify the move to go online.\n\nHow attractive is the market?\nThe low-tech toy market is somewhat attractive from a revenue standpoint, but it is lower margin\nand growing significantly slower than the high-tech side of the market. And although the market\nsize for low-tech toys is very large at $20 billion, Trevor's forecasts estimate that the company\nwould pick up less than 1 percent of this segment, a substantial risk given the potential alienation\nof some of its core customers.\nMarket size is one of the most important questions senior management must answer when\nconsidering any venture into low-tech toys. From the questions you asked, you appear to have an\nexcellent understanding of the size of the overall toy market and how the high and low-tech\nmarkets are different. Before senior management is willing to put time and resources against\nsuch a significant venture, it wants to be sure that the market potential is substantial. During the\nfinal presentation to the board of directors, you will be able to solidly back up the estimations of\nthe total retail toy market and convince everyone that it may not be the best strategy for Trevor's\nto follow.\nHow will Trevor's Toys make money?\nIn short, it is difficult to see how Trevor's Toys would make money if it began offering low-tech\ntoys. To come to this conclusion we need to look at the basic revenue and cost streams associated\nwith the proposed endeavor\nFirstly, looking at the projected revenue stream we can see that Trevor's would expect to receive\nan incremental $88 million from selling low-tech toys. This has two components:\n1) $48 million from existing customers: (three visits per year) * ($10 more per visit) * (1.6\nmillion customers)\n2) $40 million from new customers: ($40 per visit) * (two visits per year) * (500,000\ncustomers)\nHowever, this does not take into account any loss of existing customers that might occur if\nservice levels change.\nSecond, the costs associated with the increased product line should be examined. The three\nlargest components of this are cost of goods sold, additional rent for new space, and the costs of\nhiring additional staff.\n(A) Cost of goods sold (cost of purchasing the toys from the manufacturers) is about 85 percent\nof revenue and amounts to about $75 million: ($88 million revenue) ($88 million revenue) *\n(15 percent margin)\n(B) Trevor's will have an additional $10 million of rent per year, which, roughly speaking, can\nbe broken down into the following:\n1) $1.2 million for warehouse space: (four warehouses) * (150,000 sq.ft. needed per\nwarehouse) * ($2 per sq.ft.)\n\n2) $9 million for retail space: (30 stores) * (6,000 sq.ft. needed per store) * ($50 per sft)\n(C) Finally, the additional cost of retail personnel is approximately $6 million per year, based\non the following: (30 stores) * (5 new staff per store) * ($40,000 cost per person)\nThe sum of these costs is $91 million, more than $3 million more than the aggressive revenue\nforecast. Therefore, it is clear that the venture into low-tech toys is unlikely to be profitable for\nTrevor's in the near term.\nThe question looming on every executive's mind during a new business venture is, \"Can we\nmake money?\" To answer this question, it is important to investigate and develop a set of\nassumptions about the potential of the business. From the questions you asked, the revenue\npotential and predicted costs are clear. When determining the viability of ecommerce ventures, it\nis imperative that you gather as much data as possible to solidify your estimates of future growth\nand profit potential. The board of directors should feel assured othat your decision is the right\none based on the data you collected and your estimations. However, you may have gathered too\nmuch data in this area and risked missing information on other important topics. Take care to use\nyour time wisely, balancing the need to gather enough data to support solid conclusions against\nthe danger of spending time reconfirming established facts.\nWhat are the implementation issues?\nThe key to implementation lies in Trevor's ability to source new toys. This could present a\nproblem, as the company does not currently have strong relationships with many of the major\nlow-tech toy makers and will probably have to exert significant effort to build them. In addition,\nbecause Trevor's is so small (30 stores) in comparison with the large toy retailers, it probably\nwill not be able to source the products at the same low prices as the bigger companies.\nMany companies fall short on implementation when investigating a new business venture. To\nensure success, it is very important to investigate all of the implementation issues and potential\nbarriers. It appears that you asked enough questions to adequately understand whether there were\nany serious challenges to expandig Trevor's product offering. You uncovered the key points that\nmay be bottlenecks or hurdles during implementation stages. Trevor's Toys executives will be\nquick to drill into the implementation issues, and you will be able to show them that the company\ncan execute the changes required to go into low-tech toys.\nThe management team from Trevor's Toys will now review your work and decide what to do.\nThe team is grateful for your help in understanding the issues and challenges it faces in pursuing\na low-tech toy strategy, as well as for the solutions you've proposed.",
  "Goizueta_2006_BCG - GenCo": "BCG - GenCo\nInterviewer\nYour client is GenCo, a large, international, diversified company with a health care division that\nproduces a wide variety of medical instruments and related services. Five years ago, it expanded\ninto the health care software industry by purchasing MedCount, which markets administrative\nsystems to large U.S. hospitals. These systems are designed primarily for back-office functions;\nthey are not designed for managing patients or providing other physician and technical support.\nSince it was purchased, the software division has failed to deliver the growth needed to justify\nthe multiple GenCo paid for it. GenCo feels it has already squeezed margins as much as possible,\nand now is looking for new sales opportunities. MedCount turned to BCG to help identify\npotential ways to increase revenues. How would you approach this problem?\nCandidate\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem. The parent company produces medical devices\nand services, but before the acquisition was not involved in health care software. The company it\npurchased, MedCount, sells only administrative systems software to large hospitals. It is now\nlooking for opportunities to increase revenues.\nInterviewer\nThat is correct.\nCandidate\nCould I take a moment to jot down a few thoughts?\nInterviewer\nSure, that would be fine.\nCandidate\nI would suggest using the following framework: First, I'd want to understand the market size and\ngrowth rates for MedCount's market and related software markets. Next, I would like to explore\nthe competition and their market shares. Third, I would like to examine customer requirements\nand then, given those external conditions, look at the division's capabilities to understand how\nwell prepared it is to meet the needs of the marketplace.\nInterviewer\nThat sounds fine. So what do you want to know about the market?\nCandidate\nWell, the first hurdle would be to identify the markets the company would be interested in.\nBesides administration systems, what other types of medical software systems do large hospitals\npurchase?\nInterviewer\nThere are many software systems, but for the sake of time, the team focused on three primary\nmarkets: administration systems, patient administration, and physician support systems.\n\nCandidate\nWhat do those systems do?\nInterviewer\nPatient administration includes systems like admissions and tracking. Physician support systems\nare more specialized, for individual physician procedures.\nCandidate\nI would like to know how large each market is and how fast each is growing. I would use\nsecondary sources such as press releases, analyst reports, and published market studies, to obtain\nthis information.\nInterviewer\nGreat! That is what we did during the market study. Our information revealed the following\nmarket sizes and growth rates.\nAdministration Patient administration Physician support\nMarket size ($M) 1,500 1,000 1,200\nGrowth rate 5% 5% 12%\nCandidate\nFrom a size and growth perspective, physician support systems looks like a very attractive\nmarket. I'd like to know a little about the customers themselves. The client is currently targeting\nlarge hospitals. Approximately what percentage of the market do they represent?\nInterviewer\nWe were unable to get an exact breakdown, but we know that these hospitals make up the vast\nmajority of the total medical software market.\nCandidate\nThat would make sense, since the more sophisticated procedures at a hospital might necessitate\nmore advanced software solutions. I know that there have been a lot of changes in the industry as\na result of managed care. I don't know much about the industry, so I would want to look at\nmarket studies and press clippings to get a better sense of the hospital market in general and any\ntechnology or software trends more specifically.\nInterviewer\nOkay. Let's say that you did that and were presented with this summary of market trends:\n- Consolidation in the industry, with three to four large hospital networks dominating 45\npercent of the market\n- Cost controls instituted, particularly as these large hospital networks acquire smaller hospitals\n(centralization of functions being a key cost issue)\n- Many hospitals seeking to consolidate their vendor base\n- With regard to technology, many hospitals upgrading their older systems\nCandidate\n\nIf hospitals are consolidating vendors, perhaps our client has an advantage in being part of a\nlarger medical company. Maybe the client could also gain some advantages by expanding into\nother software segments. Are the people responsible for purchasing software at the hospital the\nsame for all three segments?\nInterviewer\nLike all things, it differs by hospital, but the larger hospital networks, have tried to consolidate\ntheir purchasing not only within but also across hospitals.\nCandidate\nIs the decision maker for medical software the same as for medical instrumentation and devices?\nInterviewer\nIn some cases, the head of purchasing influences both decisions, but the person who makes the\nfinal choice is different. Software decisions are usually made by the hospital IT function, and\nthose for instrumentation by the medical staff.\nCandidate\nI think I have a pretty good understanding of the market for now. Let's look at competition next.\nWe could identify all the competitors and build up the market shares using a combination of\npublic data and estimates.\nInterviewer\nWell, let's assume that you don't have an infinite amount of time to look at all the competitors.\nYou can only look at the top five competitors in each market. You are given the following data:\nAdministration Systems Sales ($M) Growth (%)\nMedCount 700 4%\nHCS Software Systems 100 7%\nMorningside Software 80 3%\nAdmin Systems Solutions 70 2%\nHTI Software 50 15%\nPatient Administration Sales ($M) Growth (%)\nHTI 300 5%\nRegistration Software Solutions 240 4%\nSignup Software 60 3%\nHCS Software Systems 30 16%\nPatient Software 20 -1%\nPhysician Support Sales ($M) Growth (%)\nHCS Software Systems 150 16%\nPhysician Support Systems 100 11%\nMedical Technology Inc 25 18%\nHTI 20 32%\nMedSys 5 15%\nCandidate\nVery interesting. The first thing I would note from the data is that the market concentrations are\nvery different. In administrative systems, the top five competitors control 66 percent of the\nmarket and in patient administration, they control 65 percent. But in the physician support\nmarket, they control only 25 percent.\n\nI would want to know what gross margins look like in each of these markets as well. I might turn\nto analyst reports and look at competitors' financial statements to deduce whether they are\nmaking money in each market.\nInterviewer\nGross margins vary, of course, but the analyst reports have margins of 25 to 30 percent for\nadministrative systems and for patient administration. For physician support, the margins tend to\nbe higher, more like 45 to 50 percent.\nCandidate\nI see that two competitors, HTI and HCS Software Systems, have very large revenue growth in\nall three sectors, although they each dominate one. I would want to look at their financials,\nannual reports, and press releases to find out a bit more about their strategy in each of these areas.\nInterviewer\nYou'd find that they recently entered these noncore markets. Why might they have done that?\nCandidate\nPerhaps, like our client, each had a strong position in its own segment, HTI in patient\nadministration and HCS Software Systems in physician support. Maybe they too decided to\nbranch out into the other segments to find additional growth.\nInterviewer\nThat is a very good hypothesis. Let's say there is evidence in the sources you consult that\nsupports your assertion.\nCandidate\nWell, if that were true, these two companies could be a threat not only in the other two segments,\nbut also in our client's segment, administrative systems. It looks as if the client is slowly losing\nmarket share in its segment, since it is growing more slowly than its market.\nInterviewer\nGood observation.\nCandidate\nThe market and competitor trends could also suggest that the client may want to enter these other\nmarkets. In particular, the physician support market looks attractive, given it has high growth and\nlack of a dominant competitor. The higher gross margins may provide attractive returns on the\nnecessary investment in software development. However, the patient administration market may\nalso be attractive. Although it is more concentrated and offers lower margins than physician\nsupport, the client may be able to enter this segment with a smaller up-front investment. Given\nthe trend toward upgrading existing computer systems, it may be important for MedCount to\nhave a product offering in each of the three market segments. That should not be too difficult,\nsince the company is already in the software industry.\nInterviewer\n\nPerhaps, but you should think a little more closely about these types of software. Are all software\nsystems alike?\nCandidate\nWell, let me think about that for a moment. I suspect patient administration would have\nrelatively low entry barriers. From your earlier description, these systems appear to be pretty\nbasic, dealing primarily with admissions and patient tracking However, the entry barriers in\nphysician support might be higher, since these systems are more complex and there are probably\nmultiple systems for the various physician procedures. I guess it would be harder to get into\nthose types of systems.\nInterviewer\nThat would make sense.\nCandidate\nSince the company might want to go into only some of the segments, I would want to know how\nimportant it is to have products in all three segments. Do we know if the competitors are\nmarketing their products as a bundle?\nInterviewer\nHow might you find that out?\nCandidate\nSince it would be difficult to talk to a competitor directly, I would probably target a competitor's\ncustomer, particularly one that just converted from our client's software.\nInterviewer\nLet's say you get an interview with a customer that recently switched to HTI. You discover that\nthe competitor was offering it a better pricing deal and service for software products in all three\nsegments.\nCandidate\nHow were MedCount's software and service perceived in relation to those of competitors?\nInterviewer\nThe customer thought that its administrative systems were adequate, \"the old standby,\" but not\nstellar.\nCandidate\nWere there any other key reasons it switched from MedCount's system?\nInterviewer\nWhen it decided to upgrade its systems, it tried to contact MedCount, but could never get a\nrepresentative to describe its options.\nCandidate\n\nInteresting. How did HTI perform?\nInterviewer\nThe HTI representative had heard that the company was considering switching software vendors\nand provided a sales representative to pitch HTI's administrative product the next day.\nCandidate\nIt definitely sounds as if there was a problem with the sales function and that customer relations\nneed to be improved, particularly for the larger hospital chains. There also seems to be an\nadvantage from both a marketing and sales perspective in having multiple software products. I\nwould want to confirm those views by doing further interviews.\nInterviewer\nLet's say further interviews support those assumptions.\nCandidate\nSince we have already looked at the external conditions, I would like to move on to the client\nitself. I'd like to know more about its marketing and selling organization as well as its software\ndevelopment skills.\nSo far, we know that our client offers administrative software and that there may be a problem\nwith sales and marketing. Could you tell me a little about the marketing department?\nInterviewer\nThe marketing department is organized regionally. Teams are assigned to hospitals within each\nstate or geographic region, such as New England.\nCandidate\nThat could explain some of the problems with MedCount's marketing and sales. If hospital\npurchasing is centralized, the marketing organization may be outdated. Does the company have\nany teams dedicated to the four or five biggest hospital networks?\nInterviewer\nNo, there are no dedicated teams. They talked about doing that for a while, but it conflicted with\nthe regional structure it had in place.\nCandidate\nWith regard to software, does the company feel it has any strengths or weaknesses?\nInterviewer\nIt feels that their administrative product is very strong (\"best of breed\") and is the dominant\ntechnology. Also, the product is modular in design, which allows for easier upgrades. Although\nthe company has never branched out into other market segments, the software developers believe\nthat certain modules could be used to build the foundation for other administrative software\nprograms. The company feels customer support is also an area in which it excels.\n\nCandidate\nLet's start with our client's market. The client dominates the administrative software market,\nwhich is fairly large but growing slowly, and the company appears to be slowly losing market\nshare. Patient administration is also growing relatively slowly. Both markets are relatively\nconcentrated and appear to offer lower margins than physician support. The physician support\nmarket is large and less concentrated, and could potentially provide higher margins, but would\nrequire a larger investment. The hospital market itself is becoming more concentrated and is\npushing to consolidate vendors. The purchasing agent is often the same for the three types of\nsoftware.\nLooking at our client's competitors, two, HTI and HCS Software Systems, appear to be\nparticularly threatening. Each has a dominant position in one segment and is branching out into\nother areas. They appear to be marketing their products and services as a bundle and are using\nservice as a key point of differentiation.\nThe client offers only one type of system and appears to have some weaknesses in its marketing\norganization, particularly in marketing to the larger hospital networks, which offer the most\npromising market opportunities.\nInterviewer\nHow would you recommend proceeding?\nCandidate\nThe first priority should be to fix the marketing organization, particularly for the large hospital\nnetworks. MedCount will have trouble expanding into new markets if it can't defend its current\nposition and shore up its existing customer relationships. There should be a team dedicated to\neach of the major chains. The client should also look at improving customer tracking so that it is\nclear when its customers are going to upgrade. There should also be clear contacts so that the\ncustomer can easily keep in touch with MedCount.\nNext, I would recommend that the client explore entering the other market segments by\nleveraging its dominant position in administrative systems. At first glance, patient administration\ndoes not appear to be very attractive, with slow growth, low margins, and large, dominant\ncompetitors. There appears to be some advantage, however, in having products across the\nproduct range. I would recommend that we interview some of MedCount's existing customers to\nbetter understand their needs and future IT requirements. If the customer base is interested in one\nsoftware provider for both back-office administration and patient administration functions, this\nsegment looks promising.\nIf the client does decide to enter this market, it should look at the lowest-cost method of entry,\neither developing a product internally or acquiring a competitor. The modular design of its\nexisting administrative software suggests internal development of the patient administration\nproduct may be the way to go, but we would need a more thorough comparison of the internal\ndevelopment and acquisition options, including both cost and time to market. I think that\nphysician support offers our client an exciting growth opportunity, given its high margins, high\ngrowth, and fragmented competition. I would definitely think about an acquisition strategy, since\n\nthe client may lack the technical capabilities to enter this specialized market. I would recommend\ngoing for one of the larger companies, as that would give the client a stronger position. Smaller\ncompanies would probably not offer an important enough position in the market. More research\nwould be needed, however, for us to better understand the intricacies of the market and each\npotential acquisition.\nInterviewer\nThose are very interesting conclusions. Thank you.",
  "Goizueta_2006_BCG - Fighter Jet": "BCG - Fighter Jet\nInterviewer\nYour client is a U.S. defense contractor that manufactures the Mohawk Light Fighter Jet for the\nBritish Royal Air Force. The company has produced the $20 million fighter jet for the past 12\nyears. The British government has decided to put the contract out to bid, however, and to win the\nprogram, the client's purchasing agents have estimated, the company will need to cut its costs by\n5 percent. It has asked BCG to help it reduce costs.\nCandidate\nLet me first clarify the question. The client manufactures a $20 million jet and, because of\ncompetitive forces, has to reduce its cost by 5 percent. Is BCG's role also to verify the purchasing\ndepartment's estimate?\nInterviewer\nNo, you can assume that the purchasing estimate is correct. BCG's role is to find the cost savings\nto meet that estimate.\nCandidate\nCould I take a few minutes to think about the case?\nInterviewer\nSure, please do so.\nCandidate\nFirst, I would like to understand the cost structure of the jet to see what we should look at first.\nNext, I would like to look at major factors driving the costs we are targeting. Finally, I would\nlike to explore potential ideas to reduce cost.\nInterviewer\nThat sounds like a very logical approach. Let's proceed.\nCandidate\nBecause the time for the interview is limited, I think we should try to identify those areas most\nresponsible for the cost of the jet.\nInterviewer\nTime is limited on real projects as well, so I think that would be a good idea! You have the\nfollowing cost information for the jet. How would you interpret it?\n\nCandidate\nThe major cost driver for the jet appears to be purchased materials. Within manufacturing, direct\nlabor is a fairly large component of cost, as are program management and corporate overhead\nwithin overhead. I think we would want to concentrate most on materials, however, since that's\nwhere most of the costs can be found.\nInterviewer\nThat sounds like a good place to start. Where would you look within materials?\nCandidate\nI see that materials are broken down into purchased subassemblies, components, and raw\nmaterials. I understand what raw materials would be, but what would be the difference between\ncomponents and subassemblies?\nInterviewer\nA subassembly functions on its own. An example is the pilot night vision system. A component\nis a smaller part, such as a part of the engine.\nCandidate\nI know that governmental agencies often have very strict guidelines about purchasing that could\naffect the cost of materials.\nInterviewer\nFor the sake of this case, you can assume that the British Ministry of Defense, MOD, allows\n\"commercial off-the-shelf\" purchases, which means that the client is free to purchase from\nwhomever it wants, as long as it can ensure that the parts meet MOD quality guidelines.\n\nCandidate\nI see that purchased subassemblies comprise more than 70 percent of materials. How many\nsuppliers are there for these subassemblies?\nInterviewer\nThere are seven suppliers of major subassemblies that go into the fighter jet.\nCandidate\nThat seems like a relatively small number. Are there more suppliers that are qualified to do this\ntype of work?\nInterviewer\nThe manufacture of these parts requires a substantial investment in R&D, engineering, and\ninfrastructure. It would be very costly for new suppliers to make the required investment,\nparticularly if the client is trying to reduce the price it pays to the subassembly manufacturers.\nCandidate\nSince there are only a few subassembly suppliers, and the investment hurdle would preclude\nbringing in competing manufacturers, it would be difficult to reduce the price paid. Perhaps we\nshould look elsewhere for savings.\nInterviewer\nBut remember, if your client loses the contract, it will lose its customer unless it is teamed with\nthe competing bidder. Even then, if the competitor is underbidding your client, there will be even\nless room for it to profit.\nCandidate\nPerhaps it would have an incentive to reduce its costs in order to maintain the contract. Are the\nmajority of its costs in materials as well?\nInterviewer\nHow could you find that out?\nCandidate\nI would want to interview the purchasing and engineering personnel of the different\nsubcontractors in order to understand their cost structures. If we had a better understanding of\ntheir economics, our client might be able to reduce cost across the board, allowing it to compete\nmore effectively for the contract without killing everyone's margins.\nInterviewer\nLet's say that purchased materials average approximately 70 percent of the price paid to most of\nthe manufacturers.\nCandidate\nIf the cost of subassemblies represents 40 percent of the jet cost and 70 percent of that is\npurchased materials, total purchased materials would be approximately 28 percent of the cost for\n\nsubassemblies. Purchases of raw materials and components represent another 15 percent, for a\ntotal of around 43 percent of the cost of the jet. If our client could reduce the cost of raw\nmaterials by 20 percent, it could reduce the cost of the jet by more than 8 percent, more than\nenough to offset the 5 percent reduction it would need to win the contract.\nInterviewer\nThat sounds reasonable, but 20 percent is a very lofty goal. How would you go about doing that?\nCandidate\nFirst, I would look at the number of suppliers. Are there a large number of suppliers to the\nsubassembly manufacturers?\nInterviewer\nThe client estimates that there are approximately 125 suppliers of raw materials and components\namong the manufacturers of the subassemblies and itself.\nCandidate\nWell, that sounds like a large number of suppliers. Of course, they could be providing very\nspecialized materials to the subassembly manufacturers. Are these suppliers providing\ncustomized or more commodity products?\nInterviewer\nAbout 80 percent of these products are commodities, such as sheet metal and wire harnesses.\nEven some of the electronics, such as printed wire boards and circuitry, are fairly generic.\nCandidate\nThat sounds promising, but I would need to know whether these commodities are\ninterchangeable, so that our client could concentrate spending with fewer suppliers. Are there\nmany commonalities among the parts used by the different subassembly manufacturers? We\ncould talk to their engineers and look at the designs and bills of material to determine how much\noverlap there is.\nInterviewer\nLet's say that you did this and discovered that approximately 30 percent of the cost of raw\nmaterials is from similar materials used across the subassembly manufacturers.\nCandidate\nIt seems safe to assume that the client would need more commonality to be successful in\nconcentrating its purchasing and reducing costs. Do the engineers believe that the percentage of\noverlap could be increased if the designs were modified?\nInterviewer\nThey believe they could increase that percentage substantially, particularly with basic materials\nsuch as screws and sheet metal, but also in other more customized areas.\nCandidate\n\nThat's great news, but we would still need to know whether the subcontractors are using the same\nsuppliers. We could analyze the number of suppliers for each of the areas of overlap.\nInterviewer\nGood suggestion. Although there are some common suppliers, the analysis indicates that the\nsubassembly manufacturers tend to use different suppliers.\nCandidate\nOur client needs to reduce costs by 5 percent. The largest area of opportunity appears to be in\npurchased materials, the majority of which comprise subassemblies manufactured by seven\nsubcontractors. By looking at its purchases in total, the client can target approximately 40\npercent of costs. To achieve the 5 percent cost reduction, it would need to reduce costs by 15 to\n20 percent. It could try to do that by increasing commonality in the design of the subassemblies\nand components and by shifting volume to a smaller number of suppliers.\nInterviewer\nConsidering that the majority of the raw materials and components are purchased commodities,\ndo you think the 15-20 percent cost reduction is achievable?\nCandidate\nWell, I know that typically have lower margins than more customized products. I suspect it may\nbe challenging to hit the client's savings target by focusing only on these purchases. But since\nraw materials and components represent about 40 percent of costs and there is an opportunity to\nconcentrate purchasing, I think we should start here.\nInterviewer\nWhere else could you look for savings?\nCandidate\nIf I look back at the cost data on the jet, direct labor is another large cost component. As a\ncontingency, we could look into that area as well. I've read that other companies use outsourcing\nto lower their manufacturing costs-perhaps our client could do the same. For example, it might\nwant to increase its use of purchased subassemblies and reduce the amount of direct\nmanufacturing it does. Of course this would work only if it could drive direct labor costs below\nthe offsetting cost of these subassemblies. The client will be working closely with the\nsubassembly suppliers to implement its purchasing initiative. This may give it an opportunity to\nexplore the suppliers' capabilities at the same time.\nInterviewer\nThat's an interesting suggestion. How would you recommend the company pursue both of the\ninitiatives you have discussed?\nCandidate\nI would look first to combine purchases across the subassembly suppliers with our client's\npurchases. I suspect that the client and the subassembly suppliers will need to share a great deal\nof information, including engineering drawings and specifications, with potential suppliers of the\n\nraw materials and components. The Internet could prove to be a very effective medium for\nforming a single \"virtual\" purchasing department to consolidate both the flow of information and\npurchase orders across the companies. Our client might also want to use a bidding system for\nthose materials that are true commodities.\nNext, I would turn to the engineering departments and form cross-company teams to look for\nareas in which to increase commonality of design. At the same time, those teams could explore\nopportunities to use more purchased subassemblies and decrease the client's direct labor costs.\nInterviewer\nThat sounds great, and is very similar to a project we did. I would caution you, however, to\nexamine the upfront costs involved in your recommendations, both for the redesign and for the\nimplementation of the purchasing system, before going ahead.",
  "Goizueta_2006_BCG - Foods, Inc": "BCG - Foods, Inc.\nInterviewer\nYour client is the sugar cereal division of Foods Inc., a U.S.-based distributor and manufacturer\nof packaged foods. According to the division president, Foods Inc.'s traditional strength has been\nwith grocery stores, which still account for the majority of its $1.1 billion in sugar cereal sales.\nBut Big M Mart, a discount chain, has been growing at a healthy rate of almost 15 percent per\nyear and has now become Food Inc's largest customer. Your client is not sure how to react, and\nhas asked BCG for assistance with its distribution strategy.\nCandidate\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem. Our client specializes in sugar cereals, and has\ntraditionally distributed through grocery stores. Sales to Big M Mart, a discount chain, have been\ngrowing at 15 percent per year, and the chain has recently become the largest distributor of the\nclient's product nationwide. We are here to help evaluate the distribution strategy in light of Big\nM Mart's growth.\nInterviewer\nThat is correct.\nCandidate\nCould you explain to me how grocery stores differ from discount stores?\nInterviewer\nSure. Grocery stores generally specialize in food, as well as selling some household goods and\nover-the-counter pharmaceuticals. Discount stores, on the other hand, offer food alongside a\nwide variety of merchandise, including clothing, home electronics, and housewares.\nCandidate\nDoes Big M Mart market its food products differently than do grocery stores?\nInterviewer\nDiscount stores advertise lower prices for a wide variety of foods, particularly staple,\nnonperishable foods.\nCandidate\nCould I take a moment to write a few notes to myself?\nInterviewer\nPlease feel free.\nCandidate\nBefore making recommendations, I think we would need to evaluate whether sales growth at Big\nM Mart is good or bad for Foods, Inc. To do that, I would first look at how its sugar cereal\nperformance at Big M Mart compares with that in other distribution channels. Second, I would\n\nlook at its performance at Big M Mart in relation to competitors' performance. Next, I would\ndetermine what drives customer purchases. Finally, I would want to understand the supply chain.\nInterviewer\nThat certainly sounds like a reasonable approach. Let's proceed.\nCandidate\nFirst, I would like to get a better sense of where Big M Mart stands relative to our client's other\ndistribution channels by examining the client's sales data and margins, by distributor.\nInterviewer\nThe marketing department does not have margins by channel, but tracks the sales and volume for\nits top five distributors.\nSales ($M) 1997 1999 2001 5-Yr CAGR\nBig M Mart 142 162 246 14.7%\nR.J.'s 157 185 200 6.2%\nBozo Mart 143 175 189 7.3%\nAce Grocery 101 109 153 11.0%\nShoppers Mart 57 62 67 4.0%\nTotal Top 5 600 693 856 9.3%\nTotal All Distributors 1,000 1,079 1,150 3.6%\nVolume (M boxes) 1997 1999 2001 5-Yr CAGR\nBig M Mart 65 74 113 14.7%\nR.J.'s 72 81 85 4.2%\nBozo Mart 65 77 80 5.2%\nAce Grocery 46 47 64 8.8%\nShoppers Mart 26 27 28 2.0%\nTotal Top 5 274 307 370 7.8%\nTotal All Distributors 450 468 487 2.0%\nWhat does this imply about Big M Mart as a distribution outlet?\nCandidate\nIt looks as if the top distributors have been growing more important, but particularly Big M Mart,\nwhich is growing faster than all the others. This is particularly true when we look at volume,\nwhere Big M Mart's growth is much higher than that of the other four channels.\nInterviewer\nAnd how could you interpret what this data says about margins?\nCandidate\nWhile the client's sales through other distribution channels are growing faster than volume, Big\nM Mart volume and sales growth are the same, so the average price paid by Big M Mart has\n\nremained constant. That implies that sales growth at Big M Mart could have negative\nimplications for our client's margins. Next, I would like to look at how our client is doing in\nrelation to the competition within Big M Mart. Have they been gaining or losing market share?\nInterviewer\nHow might you find that out?\nCandidate\nI would try to interview Big M Mart's purchasing personnel, since they would probably track\nthose data for their own purposes.\nInterviewer\nWhy would they want to talk to you? How might you approach such an interview?\nCandidate\nI would approach the purchasing personnel and suggest that our client and Big M Mart work\ntogether to identify best practices to reduce costs and increase sales of sugar cereals at Big M\nMart.\nInterviewer\nLet's say in a perfect world you could get a breakdown of Big M Mart sales for the four largest\ncompetitors (see market shares below).\nInterviewer\nWhat can we infer about our client's competitors within this channel? Who should they be\nworried about?\nCandidate\nIt looks like our client is losing market share, as is Tasty Breakfast, while Cereal Co. and Private\nLabel are gaining share. Private label, however, looks to be growing from a very small base.\nI would like to explore why our client is losing market share to Cereal Co. at Big M Marts. Are\ntheir prices better than those of our client's?\nInterviewer\n\nAfter a period of price wars six to seven years ago that lowered industry margins, the cereal\ncompanies have refrained from price competition within the same channel.\nCandidate\nIf prices are not driving the difference, I would look at other factors such as brand selection,\npercentage of shelf space, product placement, and in-store promotions.\nInterviewer\nVisits to Big M Marts indicate that each name brand company holds 30 percent of the shelf space,\nwhile private label has ten percent. However, Cereal Co. brands tend to be placed lower on the\nshelf than your client's products.\nCandidate\nWell, I suspect that children are a large target market for the sugar cereal manufacturers. The\nlower shelf placement could be especially important to children who are looking at the different\ntypes of cereals. Are there any other promotions?\nInterviewer\nSome Cereal Co. brands have sales promotion tags, and the team notes that store flyers advertise\nspecials on Cereal Co. brands for Big M Mart customer cardholders.\nCandidate\nSo, even if all the companies are maintaining product prices, maybe Cereal Co. is strategically\ndiscounting prices in order to gain market share.\nIt seems like there is evidence of cooperation between Cereal Co. and Big M Mart. Do we know\nanything about the relationship between Big M Mart and Cereal Co.?\nInterviewer\nDuring earlier discussions with Big M Mart, you discovered that your client's competitors have\n50 sales representatives dedicated to the Big M Mart account. Your client has seven.\nCandidate\nCereal Co. appears to be dedicating more resources to its relationship with Big M Mart than is\nour client. I think I have a good sense of distribution and competition. I would like to look at the\ncustomers and why they choose to select the products that they do.\nI think I have a good sense of distribution and competition. I would now like to look at the\ncustomers and understand why they select the products they do. One hypothesis I have is that\nshifting brand loyalties are hurting our client's market share at Big M Mart.\nInterviewer\nThat's interesting. What do you think might motivate purchases of sugar cereals?\nCandidate\n\nThere are lots of factors, such as the games in the boxes, the price of the cereal itself, how it\ntastes. To better understand consumer behavior, we should conduct market research, possibly\nthrough focus groups, customer observation, and price sensitivity studies.\nInterviewer\nBCG teams often do such research. Let's assume your team conducts some analysis. Your\nresearch concludes that most buyers tend to fall into two categories. Approximately 60 percent of\nbuyers go straight to one cereal and grab it. We can call this group the \"brand-loyal\" shoppers.\nAnother 40 percent of shoppers look at all the cereals and then select one that interests them.\nLet's call this group the \"impulse\" buyers.\nCandidate\nFor the brand-loyal shopper, the priority would be product availability, while product placement\nwould be important for consumers who like to shop around.\nInterviewer\nIn general, your research indicates that consumers are not price sensitive and are extremely loyal\nto their preferred brand. But when the preferred cereal is unavailable, the brand-loyal customers\nwill purchase discounted cereals approximately 35 percent of the time.\nCandidate\nWell, from that information, it appears that price is not a major driver of purchases unless the\npreferred cereal is out of stock. In these stock-out situations, you said, brand-loyal customers will\npurchase discounted cereals 35 percent of the time. What happens when the customer does not\npurchase a discounted cereal?\nInterviewer\nIn approximately 25 percent of cases, the customer walks away without purchasing any cereal at\nall. In the remaining 40 percent of cases, the brand-loyal customer will act like an impulse\nshopper and select another brand.\nCandidate\nInteresting. It seems as if product availability could be a major driver of total cereal volume for\nBig M Mart. Of course, we would need to know how often stock-outs that cause consumers to\nwalk away without purchasing cereal occur.\nSince I have a pretty good understanding of customer motivation, I'd now like to ask a few\nquestions about the client's supply chain. I would want to talk to our client's distribution\npersonnel to understand the distribution process and to determine how often stock-outs occur.\nCan you describe how our client's cereal is distributed at Big M Mart?\nInterviewer\nCereals are distributed from the factory to the distributor's warehouse twice monthly. The retailer\nthen stocks the shelves itself.\nCandidate\n\nDo we have any knowledge about when the individual stores are out of stock?\nInterviewer\nNo, we do not, since our client delivers only to the warehouses and has no direct access to in-\nstore inventory information.\nCandidate\nSince we identified product availability as a key success factor earlier on, I would want to make\nsure that the stores were stocking the product correctly.\nInterviewer\nLet's say that in your earlier in-store investigations, you found out that Big M Mart stores\naveraged 15 percent of sugar cereal brands out-of-stock, across all brands.\nCandidate\nStock-outs would be a major problem for our client, since 60 percent of customers look for a\nspecific brand of cereal and 35 percent of them would buy a discounted brand in a stock-out\nsituation. Big M Mart would also have an incentive to reduce out-of-stock incidents, since 25\npercent of the time, a brand-loyal customer will walk away without buying anything.\nAt this point, I would like to summarize what I know.\nBig M Mart is our client's leading customer, accounting for more than 20 percent of our client's\nsugar cereal revenue. Although sales to Big M Mart are increasing on an absolute basis, our\nclient's margins there are lower than in its other channels and its competitive position is eroding\nin that channel.\nAt Big M Mart, our client faces competition from both private label and Cereal Co., although the\nlatter appears to be the greater threat. There appears to be a relationship between Big M Mart and\nCereal Co. as evidenced by their joint promotions, the superior placement of the Cereal Co.\nproduct, and the substantial resources that Cereal Co. has dedicated to the Big M Mart account.\nWe learned that 60 percent of customers are brand-loyal, implying product availability is most\nimportant. However, 40 percent like to try different kinds of cereal, indicating product placement\nis also important. Purchasers do not appear to be price conscious, unless the type of cereal they\nare looking for is out of stock, in which case there is a stronger tendency to base purchases on\nprice promotions.\nIn terms of distribution, our client is making deliveries twice a month to Big M Mart's\nwarehouses. Big M Mart, in turn, is responsible for stocking the shelves. We currently have no\ndirect knowledge of when our client's items are out of stock at the individual stores, but there is\nevidence that stock-outs do occur with some frequency.\nInterviewer\nWell, it sounds as if you understand the situation. What would you recommend the client do?\n\nCandidate\nThe sales through Big M Mart appear to have a negative impact on the bottom line, as they have\nlower margins than sales through grocery stores. The client could work with grocery stores to\nensure that they are able to compete effectively with Big M Mart in the sugar cereal market. This\nstrategy could be risky, however, since Big M Mart is a large and important customer. Therefore,\nI would recommend that our client work more collaboratively with Big M Mart.\nTo defend its current position at Big M Mart stores, the client should move toward a partnership\nwith Big M Mart and dedicate more resources to the relationship. The customer and competitor\ndata indicate that our client's first priority should be to improve distribution to ensure better\nproduct availability. In addition, it should push for product placement equal to, if not better than,\nthat of its competitors.\nInterviewer\nWhy would Big M Mart be willing to enter into a partnership with Foods Inc?\nCandidate\nFoods Inc could offer to share its information about customer behavior to help increase revenues\nfor both itself and Big M Mart. Stock-outs hurt Big M Mart in two ways. First, some brand-loyal\ncustomers simply walk away without purchasing cereal whenever their preferred brand is\nunavailable. Second, we know that other brand-loyal customers purchase lower-priced cereal\nwhenever they encounter a stock-out of their preferred brand. Both of these instances lower Big\nM Mart's revenue.\nBy eliminating stock-outs, Big M Mart could increase its sales by simply ensuring that customers\ndon't walk away without making a purchase. Converting these purchase occasions to sales would\nincrease Big M Mart's sales of sugar cereals by more than 2 percent1.\nBetter availability also helps Big M Mart and our client increase their revenue by deterring the\nbrand-loyal shoppers from trading down to lower-priced cereals. Recall that 35 percent of the\nbrand-loyal shoppers purchase a discounted cereal if their preferred brand is not available. If\nimproved distribution now makes the preferred brands more consistently available, the customers\nwill pay a higher price for these products.\nFinally, we could use the information about consumer purchase behavior to help persuade Big M\nMart to share information about product availability in its individual stores. We could work with\nour client and Big M Mart to improve the current distribution system to allow for more\neconomical deliveries, while at the same time ensuring that our client's product is consistently\navailable in the store.\nInterviewer\nThank you. Those sound like solid recommendations, but I would suggest that you fully\nunderstand the root cause of the stock-out situations and the cost to eliminate them before\nmoving ahead.",
  "Goizueta_2006_BCG - Canada Co": "BCG - Canada Co.\nInterviewer\nYour client is the largest discount retailer in Canada, with 500 stores spread throughout the\ncountry. Let's call it CanadaCo. For several years running, CanadaCo has surpassed the second-\nlargest Canadian retailer (300 stores) in both relative market share and profitability. However,\nthe largest discount retailer in the United States, USCo, has just bought out CanadaCo's\ncompetition and is planning to convert all 300 stores to USCo stores. The CEO of CanadaCo is\nquite perturbed by this turn of events, and asks you the following questions: Should I be\nworried? How should I react? How would you advise the CEO?\nCandidate\nSo, the client, CanadaCo, is facing competition in Canada from a U.S. competitor. Our task is to\nevaluate the extent of the threat and advise the client on a strategy. Before I can advise the CEO I\nneed some more information about the situation. First of all, I'm not sure I understand what a\ndiscount retailer is!\nInterviewer\nA discount retailer sells a large variety of consumer goods at discounted prices, generally\ncarrying everything from housewares and appliances to clothing. Kmart, Woolworth, and Wal-\nMart are prime examples in the U.S.\nCandidate\nOh, I see. Then I think it makes sense to structure the problem this way: First, let's understand\nthe competition in the Canadian market and how CanadaCo has become the market leader. Then\nlet's look at the U.S. to understand how USCo has achieved its position. At the end, we can\nmerge the two discussions to understand whether USCo's strength in the U.S. is transferable to\nthe Canadian market.\nInterviewer\nThat sounds fine. Let's start, then, with the Canadian discount retail market. What would you like\nto know?\nCandidate\nAre CanadaCo's 500 stores close to the competition's 300 stores, or do they serve different\ngeographic areas?\nInterviewer\nThe stores are located in similar geographic regions. In fact, you might even see a CanadaCo\nstore on one corner, and the competition on the very next corner.\nCandidate\nDo CanadaCo and the competition sell a similar product mix?\nInterviewer\n\nYes. CanadaCo's stores tend to have a wider variety of brand names, but by and large, the\nproduct mix is similar.\nCandidate\nAre CanadaCo's prices significantly lower than the competition's?\nInterviewer\nNo. For certain items CanadaCo is less expensive, and for others the competition is less\nexpensive, but the average price level is similar.\nCandidate\nIs CanadaCo more profitable just because it has more stores, or does it have higher profits per\nstore?\nInterviewer\nIt actually has higher profits than the competition on a per-store basis.\nCandidate\nWell, higher profits could be the result of lower costs or higher revenues. Are the higher per-\nstore profits due to lower costs than the competition's or the result of higher per-store sales?\nInterviewer\nCanadaCo's cost structure isn't any lower than the competition's. Its higher per-store profits are\ndue to higher per-store sales.\nCandidate\nIs that because it has bigger stores?\nInterviewer\nNo. CanadaCo's average store size is approximately the same as that of the competition.\nCandidate\nIf they're selling similar products at similar prices in similarly-sized stores in similar locations,\nwhy are CanadaCo's per-store sales higher than the competition's?\nInterviewer\nIt's your job to figure that out!\nCandidate\nIs CanadaCo better managed than the competition?\nInterviewer\nI don't know that CanadaCo as a company is necessarily better managed, but I can tell you that\nits management model for individual stores is significantly different.\nCandidate\n\nHow so?\nInterviewer\nThe competitor's stores are centrally owned by the company, while CanadaCo uses a franchise\nmodel in which each individual store is owned and managed by a franchisee who has invested in\nthe store and retains part of the profit.\nCandidate\nIn that case, I would guess that the CanadaCo stores are probably better managed, since the\nindividual storeowners have a greater incentive to maximize profit.\nInterviewer\nYou are exactly right. It turns out that CanadaCo's higher sales are due primarily to a\nsignificantly higher level of customer service. The stores are cleaner, more attractive, better\nstocked, and so on. The company discovered this through a series of customer surveys last year. I\nthink you've sufficiently covered the Canadian market-let's move now to a discussion of the U.S.\nmarket.\nCandidate\nHow many stores does USCo own in the U.S., and how many does the second-largest discount\nretailer own?\nInterviewer\nUSCo owns 4,000 stores and the second-largest competitor owns approximately 1,000 stores.\nCandidate\nAre USCo stores bigger than those of the typical discount retailer in the U.S.?\nInterviewer\nYes. USCo stores average 200,000 square feet, whereas the typical discount retail store is\napproximately 100,000 square feet.\nCandidate\nThose numbers suggest that USCo should be selling roughly eight times the volume of the\nnearest U.S. competitor!\nInterviewer\nClose. USCo's sales are approximately $5 billion, whereas the nearest competitor sells about $1\nbillion worth of merchandise.\nCandidate\nI would think that sales of that size give USCo significant clout with suppliers. Does it have a\nlower cost of goods than the competition?\nInterviewer\nIn fact, its cost of goods is approximately 15 percent less than that of the competition.\n\nCandidate\nSo it probably has lower prices.\nInterviewer\nRight again. Its prices are on average about ten percent lower than those of the competition.\nCandidate\nSo it seems that USCo has been so successful primarily because it has lower prices than its\ncompetitors.\nInterviewer\nThat's partly right. Its success probably also has something to do with a larger selection of\nproducts, given the larger average store size.\nCandidate\nHow did USCo get so much bigger than the competition?\nInterviewer\nIt started by building superstores in rural markets served mainly by mom-and-pop stores and\nsmall discount retailers. USCo bet that people would be willing to buy from it, and it was right.\nAs it grew and developed more clout with suppliers, it began to buy out other discount retailers\nand convert their stores to the USCo format.\nCandidate\nSo whenever USCo buys out a competing store, it also physically expands it?\nInterviewer\nNot necessarily. Sometimes it does, but when I said it converts it to the USCo format, I meant\nthat it carries the same brands at prices that are on average ten percent lower than the\ncompetition's.\nCandidate\nWhat criteria does USCo use in deciding whether it should physically expand a store it's just\nbought out?\nInterviewer\nIt depends on a lot of factors, such as the size of the existing store, local market competition,\nlocal real estate costs, and so on, but I don't think we need to go into that here.\nCandidate\nWell, I thought it might be relevant in terms of predicting what it will do with the 300 stores that\nit bought in Canada.\nInterviewer\nLet's just assume that it doesn't plan to expand the Canadian stores beyond their current size.\n\nCandidate\nOK. I think I've learned enough about USCo. I'd like to ask a few questions about USCo's ability\nto succeed in the Canadian market. Does USCo have a strong brand name in Canada?\nInterviewer\nNo. Although members of the Canadian business community are certainly familiar with the\ncompany because of its U.S. success, the Canadian consumer is basically unaware of USCo's\nexistence.\nCandidate\nDoes CanadaCo carry products similar to USCo's, or does the Canadian consumer expect\ndifferent products and brands than the U.S. discount retail consumer?\nInterviewer\nThe two companies carry similar products, although the CanadaCo stores lean more heavily\ntoward Canadian suppliers.\nCandidate\nHow much volume does CanadaCo actually sell?\nInterviewer\nAbout $750 million worth of goods annually.\nCandidate\nIs there any reason to think that the costs of doing business for USCo will be higher in the\nCanadian market?\nInterviewer\nCan you be more specific?\nCandidate\nI mean, for example, are labor or leasing costs higher in Canada than in the U.S.?\nInterviewer\nCanada does have significantly higher labor costs, and I'm not sure about the costs of leasing\nspace. What are you driving at?\nCandidate\nI was thinking that if there were a higher cost of doing business in Canada, perhaps USCo would\nhave to charge higher prices than it does in the U.S. to cover its costs.\nInterviewer\nThat's probably true, but remember, CanadaCo must also cope with the same high labor costs.\nCan you think of additional costs incurred by USCo's Canadian operations that would not be\nincurred by CanadaCo?\n\nCandidate\nUSCo might incur higher distribution costs than CanadaCo because it will have to ship product\nfrom its U.S. warehouses up to Canada.\nInterviewer\nYou are partially right. CanadaCo has the advantage in distribution costs, since its network spans\nless geographic area and it gets more products from Canadian suppliers. However, since\nCanadaCo continues to get a good deal of product from the U.S., the actual advantage to\nCanadaCo is not great-only about two percent of overall costs.\nCandidate\nAll this suggests that USCo will be able to retain a significant price advantage over CanadaCo's\nstores: if not ten percent, then at least seven to eight percent.\nInterviewer\nI would agree with that conclusion.\nCandidate\nI would tell the CEO the following: In the near term, you might be safe. Your stores have a much\nstronger brand name in Canada than USCo's, and they seem to be well managed. However, as\nconsumers get used to seeing prices that are consistently seven to eight percent less at USCo,\nthey will realize that shopping at USCo means significant savings over the course of the year.\nAlthough some consumers will remain loyal out of habit or because of your high level of service,\nit is reasonable to expect the discount shopper to shop where prices are lowest. Moreover, over\ntime your brand-name advantage will erode as USCo becomes more familiar to Canadian\nconsumers. You certainly have to worry about losing significant share to USCo stores in the long\nterm. You should probably do something about it now, before it's too late.\nInterviewer\nCan you suggest possible strategies for CanadaCo?\nCandidate\nMaybe it can find ways to cut costs and make the organization more efficient, so it can keep\nprices low even if its cost of goods is higher.\nInterviewer\nAnything else?\nCandidate\nIt might consider instituting something like a frequent shopper program, where consumers\naccumulate points that entitle them to future discounts on merchandise.\nInterviewer\nWhat might be a potential problem with that?\n\nCandidate\nWell, it might not be that cost-effective, since it would be rewarding a significant number of\nshoppers who would have continued to shop there anyway.\nInterviewer\nAny other suggestions?\nCandidate\nCanadaCo might want to prepare a marketing or advertising campaign that highlights its high\nlevel of service. It might even institute a CanadaCo Service Guarantee that surpasses any\nguarantees offered by USCo.\nInterviewer\nAssuming the only way to keep customers is through competitive pricing, is there anything\nCanadaCo can do to appear competitive to the consumer?\nCandidate\nIt might want to consider offering fewer product lines, so that it can consolidate its buying power\nand negotiate prices with suppliers that are competitive with USCo's. It might lose some\ncustomers who want the variety of products that USCo has, but it may be able to retain the\ncustomer who is buying a limited array of items and is just looking for the best price.\nInterviewer\nAll of your suggestions are interesting, and you would want to analyze the advantages and\ndisadvantages of each in more detail before making any recommendations to the CEO.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Mercer - Hammer Jack": "Mercer - Hammer Jack\nThe case is longer and more comprehensive than any one interview you are likely to have, but\nthe individual exercises are common interview questions.\nThe case is organized in five sections: Introduction, Fact Gathering, Analysis, Recommendations,\nand Conclusion. The tab of the section you are in will always be highlighted for clarity. You can\nclick on the tabs to skip directly to a new section. We have also included tips and commentary to\nmaximize your learning. Completing the entire case will likely take you 1 - 1.5 hours.\nHammer Jack is the third-largest retailer of hardware products in the U.S. home improvement\nmarket, with annual sales of $5 billion.\nHammer Jack has experienced a steady decrease in profits over the past five years, and the CEO\nforesees another shortfall in earnings this year. He is concerned about not meeting the earnings\nexpectations of Wall Street analysts. Your team has been hired to identify and recommend ways\nto generate a minimum of $25 million in additional operating profit within the next year.\nYou and your case team will arrive at Hammer Jack’s headquarters next Monday for a brief\nproject kick-off meeting with the CEO and his direct reports, Lorraine Smith (Chief Operating\nOfficer), Henry Lee (Executive Vice President of Business Development), and Jacques Laporte\n(Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales).\nYou will need to prepare for this initial client meeting by gathering some background\ninformation and thinking through the questions you would want to ask during the meeting to\nfocus your efforts going forward.\nIn preparation for the kick-off meeting with the client, your case manager asks you to estimate\nthe market size and recent growth of the home improvement retail market in the U.S.\nWhat is your best estimate, within an order of magnitude, of the size of the U.S. home\nimprovement industry? Think through the assumptions you need to make and be ready to explain\nthem.\nOptions\n$1-2 billion\n$10-20 billion\n$100-200 billion\n$1-2 trillion\nThe size of the home improvement industry in the U.S. is $100-200 billion. Specifically, it was\n$160 billion in 2000.\nOne approach for estimating the size of the home improvement industry in the U.S. is:\n\nMarket revenues = (Number of households) X (Average home improvement\nspending per household per year)\nNumber of Households: According to the 2000 U.S. census, there are approximately 100 million\nhouseholds in the U.S. (or 300 million people in the U.S. and an average of 3 people per\nhousehold).\nAverage Home Improvement Spending: Each household spends an average of $1,600 per year on\nhome improvement products and projects - think about spending that ranges from minor\nmaintenance (several hundred dollars/year) to major upgrades and remodeling (several thousands\nor tens of thousands of dollars/year).\n100 million x $1,600 = $160 billion\nMarket sizing is a common way for interviewers to test your creativity, analytical abilities, and\nlogic. Interviewers will look for reasonable assumptions and a clear structure to your answer, not\nfor a \"right\" answer.\nYou now turn to the industry growth question. Has the home improvement industry been\ngrowing or shrinking in recent years, and how fast?\nYou find an industry report that says that in 1996, the home improvement industry generated\n$125 billion in revenues. You already know that the industry’s revenues were $160 billion in\n2000. What has the industry’s annual growth rate been during this period?\nOptions\n28.0% =($160/$125)-1\n7.0% =($160/$125-1)/4\n5.6% =($160/$125-1)/5\n6.4% =($160/$125)^(1/4)-1\nThe industry grew at an annual rate of 6.4% between 1996 and 2000.\nThe three key elements in this analysis are:\nEstimate annual (not total) growth over the period\nDetermine the correct number of annual periods over which growth occurred (there are only 4\nfull years between 1996 and 2000)\nRecognize that growth compounds (e.g., $100 growing at 20% for two years is not $100 x (1 +\n40%) = $140, but $100 x 1.20 = $120 in year 1 and $120 x 1.20 = $144 in year 2)\nInterviewers do not expect you to perform calculations that are better done with a calculator!\nThey are looking for your reasoning and your logic – these are more important than the numbers.\nThe first choice, 28%, is the total, not the annual growth of the industry during this period.\nThe second choice, 7.0%, is the straight average growth rate over 4 years. This is too high,\nbecause it does not recognize that growth rates compound, i.e., that the growth of each\n\nsubsequent year applies to both the base and the growth amount of the previous year. (In fact, the\nstraight average growth rate of 7.0% will over-estimate the 2000 revenues at $164 billion).\nThe third choice, 5.6%, would be the straight average growth rate over 5 years. It does not\nrecognize the impact of compounding, but more importantly, it uses the wrong number of growth\nperiods – there are only 4 annual growth periods between 1996 and 2000 (96-97, 97-98, 98-99,\nand 99-00). Therefore, it is too low. (In fact, a rate of 5.6% will under-estimate 2000 revenues at\n$155 billion).\nSince the straight average 4-year growth rate of 7% is always an overestimate of the actual\ngrowth, then the fourth choice, 6.4%, which is slightly lower, is the correct answer. The formula\nreflects the compounding of growth that occurs over four years, and is known as the \"compound\nannual growth rate.\"\nYou must now think through questions you would want to ask the client during the initial\nmeetings. What information would be most useful to you in helping you come up with initial\nhypotheses and work toward a solution?\nDuring both interviews and actual client cases, time is limited. You need to focus your questions\non key issues that will help you generate and rule out hypotheses. Remember, you will have a\nchance to dig into details later.\nWe have limited the number of questions you can ask to four:\nWhat are Hammer Jack's latest financial results?\n1 What is Hammer Jack's source of differentiation?\n2 Who are Hammer Jack's customers?\n3 What is Hammer Jack's scope of products and services?\n4 Has Hammer Jack made any changes to its products or prices?\n5 How have Hammer Jack's costs changed in recent years?\n6 What store formats does Hammer Jack use? Have they changed?\n7 Does profitability vary across Hammer Jack's different locations?\n8 Have there been changes in how Hammer Jack supplies its products?\n9 Who are Hammer Jack's main competitors and what is their market share?\n10 How does Hammer Jack's performance compare to competitors'?\n11 How do competitors in this market differentiate themselves?\n12 What are the major trends affecting the home improvement industry?\nWho are Hammer Jack’s customers?\nHammer Jack's Key Customer Segments\nDo-It-Yourself\nFixer-uppers who are always working on some home improvement\nMaintenance\nTypical homeowners who buy an occasional one-off item for minor repairs\nProfessionals\n\nExperienced workers and contractors who buy supplies for jobs in bulk\nA recent study helped Hammer Jack identify these three segments and their purchasing needs. It\nfound that they buy a different mix of products with different frequencies, and therefore,\ngenerate different levels of revenues and profits for the company. However, Hammer Jack has\nnot served customers in a differentiated way, or targeted them with unique offerings.\nGreat question! A company’s ability to generate profits largely depends on how well its products\nand services meet its customers’ needs. Understanding who the customers are and what their\npriorities are (and how these are changing) can often give you insight into why a company is able\nor unable to make money.\nHas Hammer Jack made any changes to its products or prices?\nHammer Jack maintains a competitively wide array of products. While the company has made\nadjustments to the volumes of products carried in response to demand changes, its basic\nproduct/service offering has been the same. Prices on average have also held steady over the past\nfive years.\nGreat question! Understanding how products and prices have changed can provide insight into\nwhy revenues and/or profits have changed.\nIf the product mix has shifted toward lower margin products, this would lower Hammer Jack’s\nprofitability. Alternatively, if the product mix hasn’t changed, but the market and competitors\nhave, Hammer Jack could be behind the times and losing customers and revenues as a result\nIf pricing pressures have been driving prices down, Hammer Jack would have seen a decline in\nprofitability, assuming all else has remained the same\nHow have Hammer Jack’s costs changed in recent years?\nThree years ago, Hammer Jack went through a major reengineering initiative which helped it\nstreamline operations and cut costs. As a result, costs initially declined rapidly as a percentage of\nrevenues. In the most recent year, the benefits of the initiative have begun to flatten out, but costs\nas a share of revenues have continued to decline.\nGreat question! Understanding whether costs have increased or decreased over time provides you\nwith direct insight into the causes of a profitability decline.\nHow does Hammer Jack’s performance compare to competitors’?\nHammer Jack’s market share has been declining. Its top three competitors appear to have been\nkeeping up with or leading the industry in terms of revenue and earnings growth. Hammer Jack’s\nfinancial performance has been lagging that of these key competitors.\n\nGreat question! When a client’s financial performance has declined, it is important to investigate\nhow its competitors have fared. Industry-wide issues may require different strategic approaches\nthan issues that are specific to the company.\nAt this point in your interview, it is useful to review the information you have gathered so\nfar, and draw any implications from what you have learned.\nPull back and summarize your findings at regular intervals during an interview.

It will help you\nstay on track. It also shows your ability to process information and draw relevant implications.\nKey findings about Hammer Jack:\n Hammer Jack is the third largest retailer in the home improvement market, with $5 billion in\nrevenues and declining profits.\n The industry is growing (6.4% annually). Hammer Jacks’ top competitors have performed as\nwell as, or better than, the industry in revenue growth and earnings performance. Hammer\nJack has been losing market share to its competitors.\n Hammer Jack has identified three customer segments, each with different buying behavior\nand needs, generating different levels of revenues and profits. However, it has not served\nthese segments in a differentiated way.\n The company’s product mix and prices are competitive, and have not changed significantly\nin recent years.\n Hammer Jack streamlined its operations recently and costs as a percent of revenues have\nbeen declining, albeit slower in the last year.\nWhat conclusions can you draw about the causes of Hammer Jack’s declining profits? What\nhypotheses do you have for possible solutions?\nBased on your initial fact gathering, you should have some hypotheses for how the client could\ngenerate $25 million in additional profits. You must now test and analyze these hypotheses\nbefore making your recommendations.\n\nHave a clear structure or framework to organize your thoughts while solving a case. You can\napply a well-known framework, or you can use your own. The key is to show that you can\nlogically think through and solve a problem.\nMercer’s approach to analyzing strategic business issues often involves examining all elements\nof a company’s business design. A company’s \"business design\" encompasses how it:\n Selects its customers and creates utility for them\n Differentiates itself and protects its market position\n Defines the tasks it will perform itself and those it will outsource\n Configures its internal systems and organization\n Captures profit\nFor more on business design, see Mercer’s book The Profit Zone and the business design issue of\nMercer Management Journal (# 10).\nYou can now explore various aspects of Hammer Jack's business design in more depth. Click on\nthe business design element you would like to investigate. You should base your selection on\nyour hypotheses for how Hammer Jack can improve its profitability. You will be able to return to\nthis page to make additional choices at any time.\nCustomer Selection and Value Proposition\nCustomers determine where a company is allowed to make a profit. \"Customer selection\" defines\nthe set of customers a company chooses to serve (as well as those it chooses not to serve). To\nsucceed, companies need to identify the most valuable customer segments and offer them\nproducts and services that address their current and emerging top priorities.\n\nTo understand who Hammer Jack’s customers are, how well the company is serving them, and\nwhat profitable opportunities exist, you contact Jacques Laporte, the Executive Vice President of\nMarketing and Sales. His group has conducted a customer survey, which identified three main\ncustomer segments:\n Professionals: Experienced workers and contractors. They spend an average of $50,000 per\nyear. However, this segment has been shrinking in size industry-wide.\n Do-It-Yourself: Fixer-uppers, doing work and home improvement projects around the house.\nThey spend an average of $5,000 per year on home improvement. This has been the fastest\ngrowing customer segment in the industry.\n Maintenance: Homeowners, buying small repair and maintenance items as needed. They\ntypically spend $500 per year. This segment has been growing at about the same rate as\npopulation growth.\nTo study differences in the product mix purchased by each segment, the survey divided Hammer\nJack’s products into two main categories – Raw materials and Finished products:\n Raw materials: Commodity goods such as wood, steel, or concrete (profit margin: 2%)\n Finished products: Manufactured and high-end items such as sinks, fixtures, lighting,\ndecorative items, and tools (profit margin: 6%)\nThe results of the survey showed that Professionals purchase primarily raw materials, whereas\nMaintenance customers buy almost exclusively finished products. Do-It-Yourselfers split their\npurchases between these two product categories.\nUsing the customer survey data, Jacques’ group has calculated the profit margin associated with\neach segment. This profit margin is determined by the mix of products that each segment buys,\nand the profitability of each product type. The results are summarized below:\n2000 Hammer Jack Revenue Breakdown by Customer Segment\nBased on this information, which segment generates the most operating profit for Hammer Jack?\nDIY is the correct answer. Based on the chart data, the customer segment that generates the most\noperating profit is the Do-It-Yourself segment ($80 million).\n\nSegment profits = Segment revenues X Segment profit margin\nSegment profits are shown in the last row of the graph below.\nThe Maintenance segment has the highest margin but it generates the least revenue. As a result,\nits contribution to operating profits in absolute $ is lower than the other segments.\nYou may notice that Professionals generate the highest profit per customer because of the high\nvolume per individual. However, there are few customers in this segment, and because they buy\nmostly raw materials, their profit margin is actually the lowest of the three segments. Overall,\nthey generate fewer profits than the Do-It-Yourself segment.\nFrom a strategic point of view, Hammer Jack should target its most valuable customers – the Do-\nIt-Yourself segment. However, it should not do so exclusively. Segment attractiveness does not\ndepend solely on current profit generation. Other important factors to consider include: Are the\nsegments growing or shrinking? Are customer priorities changing? What is the potential to sell\nadditional products and services to each segment? etc. Taking such factors into consideration\nsuggests that the Maintenance segment may also present attractive profit-generating\nopportunities – the Maintenance segment is highly profitable, still growing, and with customer\nservice needs that have some similarities with the Do-It-Yourself segment.\nConsideration of `other', often qualitative, factors demonstrates your ability to think holistically\nabout an issue. Draw upon your personal, real-life experiences to sanity-check your conclusions.\nFor example, when defining Hammer Jack’s target customers, \"other\" important factors to\nconsider include:\n Segment growth. Even though Professionals’ current operating profits exceed those of the\nMaintenance segment, the size of the Professional segment is shrinking. The Maintenance\nsegment is small, but growing (modestly) and highly profitable, and its profits will surpass\nthose from Professionals within three years!\n Add-on sales potential. The Maintenance segment is small, but growing, profitable, and\npotentially more open to the marketing of new, high-margin products and service packages\nthan the Professionals segment.\n Cost to serve. Service costs vary between customer segments. Customers who generate a lot\nof revenues, but demand high service levels may be less profitable than lower revenue/lower\n\ncost-to-serve customers. In Hammer Jack’s case, you can assume that these costs are factored\ninto the segment profit margins.\n Actionability. If target customers cannot be reached with the client’s current business design,\nany major changes that are required will take time to implement. Hammer Jack’s current\nretail network appears well equipped to reach all of the potential target customer segment(s).\nIn summary, given current segment profits and the \"other\" factors discussed above, Hammer\nJack should target the DIY segment, with some continued focus on the Maintenance segment.\nNow that you have identified Hammer Jack’s most valuable customer segments, you need to\nexamine the value proposition that the company offers to capture their business.\nA company's \"value proposition\" is the utility it creates for customers. This includes the price\nand functionality of the product or service as well as the convenience, speediness and reliability\nof delivery, customer service, and prestige and image associated with the product or service. The\nfirst step in creating a good (and profitable!) value proposition is understanding the customer's\nneeds.\nJacques Laporte’s Marketing and Sales team researched customer needs and preferences. Quotes\nfrom the survey of Do-It-Yourself customers include:\n \"It takes me so long to put together everything I need for a project. I mean, the store layout is\nfine, but I always forget the brushes, or the screws, or something, and end up having to make\nseveral trips.\"\n \"It sometimes takes me several months to get a project going, because I just can’t seem to fit\nthe shopping and planning into my normal work schedule. I work all day, 6 days a week, so\nthat leaves me with Saturday afternoon for all the errands...\"\n \"I put projects on hold, because it always ends up costing me more than I thought it would.\nI’d love to know how much it’s going to cost me without having to walk around with a\ncalculator. Tell me, \"Here’s the total\", and I’ll be fine.\"\n \"I love doing work around the house. For example, I’d much rather change the kitchen\nwallpaper myself, but I’ve never done it and it seems daunting. I am not sure where to start.\"\n \"Home improvement is expensive. It’s tough to pay all at once for some of the big projects I\nwant to do. It seems easier to buy furniture or a car, even though they cost more.\"\n \"I enjoy the work, but I hate the logistics. The whole experience – wandering around the isles,\nbreaking my back hauling stuff to my car, unloading it all at home – is miserable.\"\nA separate team also benchmarked Hammer Jack’s store format and its current product portfolio.\nThe team found that the range and mix of products offered is competitive, and that while store\nformats vary slightly among competitors, there are no clear \"winners\", and Hammer Jack’s stores\nare at least as appealing and functional as the rest of the industry.\nWhat does this information tell you? What are the strategic implications for Hammer Jack?\nBased on this information, it is clear that while its product selection and store formats are\ncompetitive in the market, Hammer Jack's value proposition does not address the full scope of\nneeds of its most valuable customers, the Do-It-Yourselfers.\n\nDIY customers want to be able to do more things themselves, but need training, more support,\nand a simpler shopping and project execution experience. In the unmet needs of Hammer Jack's\nmost profitable customers lies a clear opportunity for the company to improve its profitability.\nThink about the type of new products and services Hammer Jack could offer to better meet its\ncustomers' needs and generate additional earnings in the process.\nHere are some ideas you might have come up with to help Hammer Jack address the unmet\nneeds of its target customers and increase operating profits:\n Longer store hours. Do-It-Yourselfers have other jobs. Extending store hours gives them\nthe convenience to shop after work and during more hours on the weekend.\n Project packages. Putting all materials needed for a project together into one package\nsimplifies the shopping experience for non-professionals and helps simplify project planning.\nIt also allows Hammer Jack to capture all purchases related to a customer’s project.\n \"How-to\" classes. Training classes (e.g., every Sunday, or on a pre-scheduled basis) would\nenable customers to do more complex home projects themselves, driving demand for a\nbroader range of products. Class fees would also contribute to Hammer Jack’s bottom line.\n Financing. Making payment easier by enabling customers to receive financing for large\nhome improvement projects could both spur demand and add a high-margin revenue stream\n(financing fees) to Hammer Jack’s financials.\n Delivery services. Offering home delivery of large/heavy materials and products (for a fee)\ncould address customers’ inconvenience concerns and increase their preference for shopping\nat Hammer Jack’s.\nBefore presenting your recommendations to Hammer Jack, you should prioritize the options and\nensure that they can help the client achieve its earnings goal. You work with Jacques Laporte’s\ngroup to size the potential market and estimate the expected operating profit margin from each of\nthese initiatives.\nFocusing primarily on the Do-It-Yourself segment, but assuming some adoption by the\nMaintenance and Professional segments as well, you and Jacques’ team estimate the potential\nrevenue and operating profit margin of each initiative as follows:\n\nBased on these data, how should Hammer Jack prioritize these initiatives?\nConsider the following questions:\n How much revenue does each initiative generate?\n Based on their profit margins, how much operating profit does each initiative generate?\nBased on the profit data provided, we would prioritize the five initiatives as follows:\n1. Longer hours (Expected profits: $14 million)\n2. Financing (Expected profits: $12 million)\n3. Delivery (Expected profits: $8 million)\n4. Project packages (Expected profits: $7 million)\n5. \"How-to\" classes (Expected profits: $2 million)\nNo single initiative will enable Hammer Jack to reach its $25 million in additional operating\nprofits. Therefore, two or more initiatives in combination must be implemented in order to meet\nthe company’s goal. For example, longer hours and financing, or financing and project packages\nand delivery will enable Hammer Jack to reach its operating profit goal.\nWhat other factors would you consider when prioritizing the initiatives and making\nrecommendations to the client?\nFrom a strategic standpoint, several other factors should be considered when prioritizing the\ninitiatives before making the final recommendation:\n Time to implementation and ramp-up time: How long will it take to roll out an initiative?\nHow long will it take before the benefits can be felt?\n– None of the initiatives here require significant development or roll out time; while there\nwill be some ramp-up time before each initiative can reach its maximum potential, they are\ncomparable in this respect. Ramp-up time considerations, however, would argue for pursuing\nmore than two initiatives right away to achieve the target of $25 million within a year.\n Cost of implementation: Do initiatives require significant initial investment?\n– All of the proposed initiatives appear to be relatively ‘quick hits’, requiring low\ninvestment; \"Delivery\" is the only one that may require some additional equipment and\ncapability.\n Impact of initiative on current business: Will an initiative cannibalize existing revenues?\n– Project packages may cannibalize sales of single items that Do-It-Yourselfers would have\nbought separately. However, \"package\" sales are expected to generate additional sales, with\noverall higher margins than comparable single items. The expected incremental revenues and\nprofits are net of assumed cannibalization effects. The other initiatives are not expected to\ncannibalize Hammer Jack’s current business.\n Reaction from competitors: Will an initiative generate a negative competitive response?\n– These initiatives do not directly infringe upon competitors’ businesses. While they may be\ncopied by competitors later, Hammer Jack will have at least a short-term \"leader\" advantage.\nTaking these factors into consideration would suggest that Hammer Jack should implement at\nleast three or more of the initiatives. Since they are generally comparable in terms of ease and\nspeed of implementation, profit contribution should drive the order of prioritization: longer hours,\n\nfinancing and delivery (or project packages if the delivery equipment will neutralize the $1\nmillion in extra operating profit in the near term). The new services should be marketed\nespecially to Do-It-Yourself customers, with some attention to Maintenance customers as\nappropriate. Other initiatives can be pursued as soon as management and company resources\nallow.\nAt some point during the interview, be sure to bring your analysis to a conclusion – summarize\nyour findings, take a position and make an actionable recommendation.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Mercer - Star Corporation": "Mercer - Star Corporation\nTo: Joe/Jane Consultant\nFrom: Steve Fernandez, VP\nRe: Brain Zone\nAs you know, Star Corporation, a large diversified manufacturer of consumer electronic goods, is a long-\ntime client of the firm. Star has recently come upon the opportunity to invest in a company, Brain Zone, a\nvideo game developer.\nWhile Star is a major player in the consumer electronics area, the CEO has admitted that she has only a\nvery basic understanding of the dynamics and structure of the video game industry. As such, she has\nasked Mercer to offer a preliminary recommendation on the opportunity, so that we can determine if it is\nworth further investigation and case work.\nShe would like a response in this afternoon's meeting. I need you to briefly determine, structure and\ninvestigate the primary issues so that we can offer the client a recommendation.\nI apologize that I was unable to speak to you in person about this, but I'll come by your office at 1:45 and\nyou can brief me on your recommendation on the way to the client meeting.\nNow is your opportunity to ask some questions for clarification or general background.\nIn the context of this case, you may have the opportunity to ask the VP, or you may just have 5\nminutes to scan Brain Zone's and/or Star Corporation's websites. Make a quick list of clarifying\nquestions that you would like to ask.\nBut beware! Not all of the possible questions we provide are necessarily good questions to ask.\nRemember that at this stage in the interview you are trying to accomplish two things:\n Make sure you understand the case, company and background (without launching into\nspecifics)\n Make sure the interviewer did not intentionally leave out an important piece of big-picture\ninformation.\nYou are allowed to ask no more than four of the following questions:\n Who is Brain Zone’s target customer?\n How long has Brain Zone been a player in the video game industry?\n What type of product does Brain Zone manufacture?\n Who are Brain Zone’s current customers?\n What is Star Corporation’s reason for wanting/considering the investment?\n What are the primary distribution channels for Brain Zone’s products?\n Have Brain Zone’s products been successful in the marketplace?\n Who are Brain Zone’s competitors?\n What do analysts think of Brain Zone?\n Is Brain Zone’s work force unionized?\n What is Brain Zone’s likely reaction to an investment and/or acquisition by Star?\nWhat type of product does Brain Zone manufacture?\n\nBrain Zone develops 'edutainment' software. The company's products are praised by the\nmarketplace as being both fun and educational. What differentiates Brain Zone from a traditional\neducational software developer is the company's focus on developing products that involve\nplayers in a series of challenges and fantasy worlds requiring problem solving capabilities.\nHave Brain Zone’s products been successful in the marketplace?\nBrain Zone has developed three games. The first two were not successful. However, initial\ncustomer response to Brain Zone's latest products has been positive, although the customer\nsample selected to test the prototype might not be representative of the mass market.\nIs Brain Zone’s work force unionized?\nNo. Brain Zone is a small, high-tech start up in which all of its employees work at will and\nwithout collective organization.\nWhat is Brain Zone’s likely reaction to an investment and/or acquisition by Star?\nWhile Brain Zone will likely want to hang on to its entrepreneurial spirit and culture, it will\nbenefit greatly from Star’s deep pockets. Most of the more successful software development\ncompanies are divisions of big companies with deep pockets. Financing muscle is a big plus for\nsoftware development, which requires a great deal of investment prior to any resulting revenues.\nFor this reason, Brain Zone would probably be a very willing acquisition target and/or 'investee.'\nNow it's time to determine how you will start structuring the case. Spend a few minutes outlining\nthe general areas you would like to investigate. This may be in the format of a framework you\nhave studied or one which you develop specifically to address the issues you find relevant to the\ncase.\nLet your framework be driven more by the issues relevant to this case than by any particular\nframework you may have studied; beware of the common folly of inappropriately forcing a\nframework on a case.\nIt is important that you determine this structure (including the questions you would ask) before\ncontinuing because it will help you:\n Practice the most important part of the case interview: structuring your analysis\n Prioritize and make the best use of your time\nHow large is this industry?\nThis one is for you to answer. Spend a few minutes thinking through the assumptions and math\nthat will provide you with the total amount of money spent on home entertainment video games\nin the United States each year.\n$10Billion?\nYour answer is within reasonable estimates.\n\nHow quickly is the industry growing?\nThe home entertainment video games market is growing robustly. Retail sales of video game\nhardware and software in the US increased 22% in 1998 over the prior year. The growth has\npersisted in the first quarter of 1999 (most recent information available) with an 18% increase in\nentertainment software sales over the prior year first quarter.\nHow significant do you think the growth is in this market? If the market is growing at 20% per\nyear, how many years will it take to double in size?\nOptions\n Approximately 2 years\n Approximately 3 years\n Approximately 4 years\n Approximately 5 years\n Don’t know\nAnswer\nApproximately 4 years. It is important to have a grasp on the quick calculations required to help\nyou get an idea for scale in a case or a \"real-life\" consulting situation.\nWhat are the key customer segments in the video game market?\nDemographically, the primary customers for console based video games consist of young males\nbetween the ages of 10-22. On the other hand, females represent more of the PC/Mac recreation\nsoftware users, and 42% of educational software users.\nAnother interesting way to segment the video game customer market is to group customers by\ntheir needs—the reason for making a video game purchase. The three main customer groups\nbased on this segmentation are:\n1. Fast ‘Twitchers’: are buyers who purchase video games purely for entertainment purposes.\nThese players are action addicts, looking for games that provide them with a great playing\nexperience. Since the reality of the playing experience and the graphic interface is most\nimportant to these customers, the speed of the underlying machinery that actually runs the\ngames is critical in their purchase decision making process.\n2. Slow ‘Twitchers’: are buyers for whom the action element of a game does not play a critical\nrole in their purchase decision making process. These players are more interested in games\nsuch as Solitaire or Minesweeper that are more individual in nature. Brand and\nrecommendations have a big impact on the purchases made by this group.\n3. Edutainers: are the buyers who purchase video games that have an ‘educational’ twist to\nthem. Games such as Myst and Sim City fall into this category. These buyers might be\nmaking the purchase for themselves or others (e.g. their children).\nWhich customer segment is most profitable?\n\nIn order to determine which segment is most attractive, we first need to assess the relative\nprofitability of each segment. In order to do that, we will need each of the following factors.\n Size of Segment\n Revenue/Customer\n Profit Margin/Customer Segment\nUsing the following data, calculate the profitability of each segment. Assume the total market\nconsists of 25 million individuals.\nFAST TWITCHERS SLOW TWITCHERS EDUTAINERS\nSegment Size (% of total) 50% 30% 20%\nSegment Revenue ($BB) 2.25 1.50 1.25\nProfit Margin (%) 30% 20% 30%\nFAST TWITCHERS SLOW TWITCHERS EDUTAINERS\nSegment Size (MM people)\n12.5 7.5 5\nRevenue/Customer\n180 200 250\nTotal Segment Profits ($BB)\n0.675 0.3 0.375\nWhat are the trends impacting future growth in this industry?\nThere are three major trends impacting the video game industry currently:\nInstalled Base\nThe rapidly growth of next-generation consoles and the continued penetration of PCs in the\nhome contribute to a solid and growing installed base for home entertainment video games.\nSub-$1000 PCs\nIn addition to the impact on the installed base, the rapid growth of sub-$1000 PCs has introduced\na new type of customer to the entertainment video games market. Many purchasers of sub-$1000\nPCs would not have been potential video game customers if they had not had the opportunity to\nbuy a cheap PC.\nInternet and Network Gaming Sites\nAnother major trend impacting the video game market is the Internet and the rise of gaming sites\navailable on the World Wide Web. These sites allow players to download games onto their\ndesktops either free or for a small fee. While the speed of current modem connections make this\nprocess slow and time consuming, improvements in technology will do away with this hurdle.\n\nNetwork gaming allows players to play against each other via networks. So for instance, co-\nworkers in an office could play PC games against each other during breaks over the company\nnetwork.\nWhat is the nature of Brain Zone’s successful product?\nBrain Zone’s successful product is a game called Survival. The protagonist/player travels around\nthe world with limited means (food, arms, supplies) and faces various challenges. As the\nprotagonist tries to overcome the challenges (hurricanes, guerilla attacks, deserts, etc.) he can\ngain access to more supplies if he is able to identify certain geographical features, including\ncities (access to medical supplies and food), rivers (drinking water), mountains (evasion of\nenemies) and others. The player must know the geographical feature’s location and name to\naccess its resources.\nWhat platforms do Brain Zone’s games run on?\nBrain Zone has traditionally developed games for the Sony Playstation. However, its contract\nwith Sony will soon be expiring. As such, the company needs to make a decision about whether\nto renew its contract with Sony or develop games for a different platform (either a different\nconsole manufacturer or for the PC). This decision will clearly involve an understanding of\nwhich platform will be the leader in the market going forward.\nWhich platform will be the winning platform in the future?\nThe video game industry has traditionally been dominated by console based game units. These\nmachines generally cost between $150-$250 and are usually hooked up to a TV in the consumers\nhome. The second product category in the video game market is PC based video games. This\ncategory consists of software that has been developed for home computers. While some of this\nsoftware is bundled into the computer and is available for immediate use, the more interesting\nproducts are available for sale at most large computer retailers. The current market share of\nconsole based video games (machines that can be attached to the TV) is 66% of the total video\ngame market. With $1.8 BB in sales in 1997, PC based software owns the rest of the market.\nThese relative market shares are projected to level out over the next five years with each type of\ngame system owning about 50% of the market.\nWho are Brain Zone’s current customers?\nAs its latest product is only in the prototyping stage, the company does not currently have a solid\ncustomer base. Due to its contract with Sony Playstation, however, the game will be distributed\nunder the Sony label and marketed as such to Sony Playstation owners.\nSteve, the VP, has arrived and is ready to go to the meeting. On the way, he expects you to brief\nhim on your preliminary findings and specifically whether or not you think Star should invest in\nBrain Zone. Take a stand (either invest in Brain Zone or do not) and make a brief list of your\nsupporting reasons. Then click a link below to reveal the \"answers\" (insofar as any really exist!),\nour methodology for cracking the case and feedback on your performance.\n\nRecommendation\nDo NOT invest in Brain Zone.\nAlthough much of the information in the case supports a decision to enter the video game\nmarket...\n The video game market is large and growing rapidly.\n Two key developments in the industry make this a good time to enter—new platform\ntechnologies (a move toward PCs and away from proprietary play stations) and new\ndistribution channels (away from software stores to catalogs and online purchases).\n The high development costs associated with participating in this industry will keep many\nsmaller players out or at least render them unprofitable. Star Corporation's deep pockets will\nbe a tremendous asset.\n...it is unlikely that Brain Zone is the best way to do so.\n The edutainment segment is the least attractive in terms of size and profitability.\n Brain Zone has only one successful game to date and even the popularity of that game is not\nproven on a mass-market level.\n Brain Zone's games are console-based only. Although the company could change to PC-\nbased design upon the expiration of its contract with Sony, it is certainly not a leader in PC-\nbased video games, which is the segment with the most aggressive growth estimates.\n Brain Zone does not have any proven ability in Internet-based games, network games, or\ndelivery of software via the Internet, all of which are considered the future of the industry.\n(This interactive online case has a time limit. The above questions represent what I was able to\nask in the allowed time, and do not necessarily represent the questions Mercer thinks best ones to\nbe asked.)",
  "Goizueta_2006_Retail Competition": "Retail Competition\nYour client is the largest discount retailer in Canada, with 500 stores spread throughout the\ncountry. Let's call it \"CanadaCo.\" For several years running, CanadaCo has surpassed the second\nlargest Canadian retailer (300 stores) in both relative market share and profitability. The largest\ndiscount retailer in the United States, \"USCo,\" however, has just bought out CanadaCo's\ncompetition and is planning to convert all 300 stores into USCo stores. The CEO of CanadaCo is\nquite perturbed by this turn of events, and asks you the following questions: \"Should I be\nworried? How should I react?\" How would you advise the CEO?\nSome Questions and Answers:\n- Well, before I can advise the CEO I need some more information about the situation. First of\nall, I'm not sure I understand what a \"discount retailer\" is!\no A discount retailer sells a large variety of consumer goods at discounted prices,\ngenerally carrying everything from housewares to appliances to clothing. Kmart,\nWoolworth, and Wal-Mart are prime examples in the U.S.\n- Oh, I see. Then I think it makes sense to structure the problem this way: First, let's\nunderstand the competition in the Canadian market and how CanadaCo has become the\nmarket leader. Then, let's look at the U.S. to understand how USCo has achieved its position.\nAt the end, we can merge the two discussions to understand whether USCo's strength in the\nU.S. is transferable to the Canadian market.\no That sounds fine. Let's start, then, with the Canadian discount retail market. What\nwould you like to know?\n- Are CanadaCo's 500 stores close to the competition's 300 stores, or do they serve different\ngeographic areas?\no The stores are located in similar geographic regions. In fact, you might even see a\nCanadaCo store on one corner, and the competition on the very next corner.\n- Do CanadaCo and the competition sell a similar product mix?\no Yes. CanadaCo's stores tend to have a wider variety of brand names, but, by and\nlarge, the product mix is similar.\n- Are CanadaCo's prices significantly lower than competition's?\no No. For certain items CanadaCo is less expensive, and for others the competition\nis less expensive, but the average price level is similar.\n- Is CanadaCo more profitable just because it has more stores, or does it have higher profits\nper store?\no It actually has higher profits than the competition on a per-store basis.\n- Well, higher profits could be the result of lower costs or higher revenues. Are the higher per-\nstore profits due to lower costs than the competition's or the result of higher per-store sales?\no CanadaCo's cost structure isn't any lower than the competition's. Its higher per-\nstore profits are due to higher per-store sales.\n- Is that because it has bigger stores?\no No. CanadaCo's average store size is approximately the same as that of the\ncompetition.\n- If they're selling similar products at similar prices in similar-sized stores in similar locations,\nwhy are CanadaCo's per-store sales higher than the competition's?\no It's your job to figure that out!\n\n- Is CanadaCo better managed than the competition?\no I don't know that CanadaCo as a company is necessarily better managed, but I can\ntell you that its management model for individual stores is significantly different.\n- How so?\no The competitor's stores are centrally owned by the company, while CanadaCo\nuses a franchise model in which each individual store is owned and managed by a\nfranchisee who has invested in the store and retains part of the profit.\n- In that case, I would guess that the CanadaCo stores are probably better managed, since the\nindividual store owners have a greater incentive to maximize profit.\no You are exactly right. It turns out that CanadaCo's higher sales are due primarily\nto a significantly higher level of customer service. The stores are cleaner, more\nattractive, better stocked, and so on. The company discovered this through a series\nof customer surveys it administered last year. I think you've sufficiently covered\nthe Canadian market---let's move now to a discussion of the U.S. market.\n- How many stores does USCo own and how many does the second largest discount retailer\nown in the U.S.?\no USCo owns 4,000 stores and the second largest competitor owns approximately\n1,000 stores.\n- Are USCo stores bigger than those of the typical discount retailer in the U.S.?\no Yes. USCo stores average 200,000 square feet, whereas the typical discount retail\nstore is approximately 100,000 square feet.\n- Those numbers suggest USCo should be selling roughly eight times the volume of the nearest\nU.S. competitor!\no Close. USCo's sales are approximately $5 billion, whereas the nearest competitor\nsells about $1 billion worth of merchandise.\n- I would think that sales of that size give USCo significant clout with suppliers. Does it have a\nlower cost of goods than the competition?\no In fact, its cost of goods is approximately 15 percent less than that of the\ncompetition.\n- So it probably has lower prices.\no Right again. Its prices are on average about 10 percent lower than those of the\ncompetition.\n- So it seems that USCo has been so successful primarily because it has lower prices than its\ncompetitors.\no That's partly right. Its success probably also has something to do with a larger\nselection of products, given the larger average store size.\n- How did USCo get so big compared with the competition?\no It started by building superstores in rural markets served mainly by mom & pop\nstores and small discount retailers. It bet that people would be willing to buy from\nit, and they were right. As it grew and developed more clout with suppliers, it\nbegan to buy out other discount retailers and convert their stores to the USCo\nformat.\n- So whenever USCo buys out a competing store it also physically expand its?\no Not necessarily. Sometimes it does, but when I said it converted it to the USCo\nformat, I meant that it carries the same brands at prices that are on average 10\npercent lower than the competition's.\n\n- What criteria does USCo use in deciding whether it should physically expand a store it's just\nbought out?\no It depends on a lot of factors, such as the size of the existing store, local market\ncompetition, local real estate costs, and so on, but I don't think we need to go into\nthat here.\n- Well, I thought it might be relevant in terms of predicting what it will do with the 300 stores\nthat it bought in Canada.\no Let's just assume that it doesn't plan to expand the Canadian stores beyond their\ncurrent size.\n- OK. I think I've learned enough about USCo. I'd like to ask a few questions about USCo's\nability to succeed in the Canadian market. Does USCo have a strong brand name in Canada?\no No. Although members of the Canadian business community are certainly\nfamiliar with the company because of its U.S. success, the Canadian consumer is\nbasically unaware of USCo's existence.\n- Does CanadaCo carry products similar to USCo's, or does the Canadian consumer expect\ndifferent products and brands than the U.S. discount retail consumer?\no The two companies carry similar products, although the CanadaCo stores lean\nmore heavily toward Canadian suppliers.\n- How much volume does CanadaCo actually sell?\no About $750 million worth of goods annually.\n- Is there any reason to think that the costs of doing business for USCo will be higher in the\nCanadian market?\no Can you be more specific?\n- I mean, for example, are labor or leasing costs higher in Canada than in the U.S.?\no Canada does have significantly higher labor costs, and I'm not sure about the costs\nof leasing space. But what are you driving at?\n- I was thinking that if there's a higher cost of doing business in Canada, perhaps USCo will\nhave to charge higher prices than it does in the U.S. to cover its costs.\no That's probably true, but remember, CanadaCo must also cope with the same high\nlabor costs. Can you think of additional costs incurred by USCo 's Canada\noperations that would not be incurred by CanadaCo?\n- USCo might incur higher distribution costs than CanadaCo, since it will have to ship product\nfrom its U.S. warehouses up to Canada.\no You are partially right. CanadaCo is advantaged in distribution costs, since its\nnetwork spans less geographic area and it gets more product from Canadian\nsuppliers. However, since CanadaCo continues to get a good deal of product from\nthe U.S., the actual advantage to CanadaCo is not great---only about 2 percent in\nterms of overall costs.\n- All this suggests that USCo will be able to retain a significant price advantage over\nCanadaCo's stores: if not 10 percent, then at least 7-8 percent.\no I would agree with that conclusion.\n- Then I would tell the CEO the following: In the near term, you might be safe. Your stores\nhave a much stronger brand name in Canada than those of USCo, and seem to be well\nmanaged. However, as consumers get used to seeing prices that are consistently 7-8 percent\nless at USCo, they will realize that shopping at USCo means significant savings over the\ncourse of the year. Although some consumers will remain loyal out of habit or because of\n\nyour high level of service, it is reasonable to expect the \"discount\" shopper to shop where\nprices are lowest. Moreover, over time your \"brand-name\" advantage will erode as USCo\nbecomes more familiar to Canadian consumers. You certainly have to worry about losing\nsignificant share to USCo stores in the long term. You should probably do something about it\nnow, before it's too late.\no Can you suggest possible strategies for CanadaCo?\n- Maybe it can find ways to cut costs and make the organization more efficient, so it can keep\nprices low even if its cost of goods is higher.\no Anything else?\n- It might consider instituting something like a \"frequent shopper\" program, where consumers\naccumulate points that entitle them to future discounts on merchandise.\no What might be a potential problem with that?\n- Well, it might not be that cost-effective, since it would be rewarding a significant number of\nshoppers who would have continued to shop with it anyway.\no Any other suggestions?\n- It might want to prepare a marketing or advertising campaign that highlights its high level of\nservice. It might even institute a “CanadaCo Service Guarantee\" that surpasses any\nguarantees offered by USCo.\no Assuming the only way to keep customers is through competitive pricing, is there\nanything CanadaCo can do to appear competitive to the consumer?\n- It might want to consider offering fewer product lines, so that it can consolidate its buying\npower and negotiate prices with suppliers that are competitive with USCo's. It might lose\nsome customers who want the variety of product that USCo has, but be able to retain the\ncustomer who is buying a limited array of items and is just looking for the best price.\no All of your suggestions are interesting, and you would want to analyze the\nadvantages and disadvantages of each in more detail before making any\nrecommendations to the CEO.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Fertilizer Factory (Bain)": "Fertilizer Factory (Bain)\nNote: This was a more complex case that involved risk profile analysis and data-based market-\nsegment targeting….however, it has been reconstructed from a foggy recollection and much of\nthe detail has been lost in the sands of time :-(\nInterviewer\nYour client is a small, family-owned fertilizer company. The R&D department at this company\nhas developed a new product technology. Using the new product instead of the normal fertilizer\ncan increase the yield by 10%. 25% of the revenues come from the special/ premium fertilizer\nthat the client sells to a private label. The special fertilizer costs $200 to produce and is sold at\n$500. What are the profits from the private label, given that total revenues are $1B?\nCandidate\nProfit = Revenues – Costs = (Price – Per Unit Cost) x Units Produced\nSold to private label, revenues = 25% of $1B = $250 M\nSince price is $500, quantity = $250 M/ $500 = 0.5 M tons\nTherefore profits = 300 x 0.5 M = $150 M\nInterviewer\nOn average, the farmers get 135 bushels per year per acre, and sell the product at $2 per bushel.\nTo obtain this yield, they use 1/3 ton of basic fertilizer per year per acre. How will you price the\nnew product?\nCandidate\nWith basic fertilizer, revenues = 135 x $2 = $270/year/acre\nCost of fertilizer = 1/3 x 160 = 531/ /year/acre\nRevenue with new product = 10% more = 297 ~ $300/year/acre\nThis is $30 more than that with basic fertilizer.\nSince $30 is realized per acre and an acre uses only 1/ kg, per kg benefits realized = $90\nThus, the product can be priced anywhere between $160 and $250.\nInterviewer\nHow much more will a farmer with a 75 acre farm have to pay more for the new product than for\nthe standard present fertilizer?\nCandidate\nThat would depend on the exact price of the new product. And the price of the new product will\ndepend on the price elasticity of demand. If demand is elastic, most of the economic gains\n\nwill be passed on to the consumer. On the other hand, if we find that the demand is relatively\ninelastic\nthen the manufacturer can keep the bulk of the benefit.\nInterviewer\nSo, tell me what price you’d suggest. Elasticity information is not available.\nCandidate\nI would probably price the product at $200/kg. Thus\nper acre premium = 40/3 = 131/\nFor a 75 acre plot,\nOld fertilizer = 160 x 75 x 1/3 = 4000\nNew fertilizer = 200 x 75 x 1/3 = 5000\nThe farmer will have to pay $1000 more",
  "Goizueta_2006_Helpless Helmets (Bain)": "Helpless Helmets (Bain)\nMock interview with Derek Robinson\nInterviewer\nYour client is a manufacturer of bike helmets. It sells to retailers who sell to the end-consumers.\nThe business has been stagnant for a while. The industry as a whole is neither growing nor\ndeclining, either. The company is profitable, but the CEO wants more. You need to explore:\nDomestic vs. International expansion\nTop-line growth vs. Profits\nCandidate\nI would like to consider the following simple growth strategies:\n- Decrease costs\n- Increase revenues\nStarting with the costs, I’d like to understand whether it is possible to restructure the fixed costs\nor lower the variable costs…\nInterviewer\nCosts are really not an issue here.\nCandidate\nSince costs are ruled out, let us focus on increasing revenues. I see five ways of increasing\nrevenues:\n- Expand the market\n- Steal market share\n- Enter a new market\n- Increase prices\n- Change the product mix being promoted\nStarting with prices, I am wondering about the price elasticity, and whether it will be possible to\nincrease revenues profitably by raising the prices? Or lowering them?\nInterviewer\nThat is not really very important here.\nCandidate\nOkay, so let’s move to expanding the market. Does it seem possible that we may be able to\nincrease the usage, or essentially make people buy more of the product, unlikely as it may\nappear?\nInterviewer\nFor a bike helmet, making the same people buy more doesn’t seem very probable.\nCandidate\nIn that case, let us look at increasing the number of buyers. For the international market, I will\nlook primarily at cultural, pricing and usage issues while for the domestic market…\n\nInterviewer\nLet us focus on the domestic market, and leave international expansion aside.\nCandidate\nExcuse me, but seems like I haven’t understood the question correctly. Didn’t the client ask me\nto compare international and domestic expansion options?\nInterviewer\nNo, the client has asked you to look at the domestic market only.\nCandidate\nOh, dear! I thought the client needed a Domestic versus International comparison. Now I can see\nthat you meant it more like Domestic as opposed to International.\nInterviewer\nOh, sorry about the confusion. All the people who interviewed you understood the meaning\ncorrectly. However, I can see how this can be interpreted the way you did. Sorry about that.\nCandidate\nOh, I am sorry. I should have clarified in the beginning. I guess product-mix issues are also out\nof the picture since we only want to look at increasing revenues, not profits. If we are looking for\ntop line growth in the domestic market, to increase the number of buyers we need to consider the\nchannel we are selling through. About these retailers – who are they in terms of usage? Can they\nbe categorized on volumes or margins?\nInterviewer\nThere are two types of retailers\nHigh Earnings – Cycle shops. There are 4 chains, but most are small independent shops.\nLow Earnings – Wal-Mart\nCandidate\nVery interesting. How does our brand-name fare with these channels?\nInterviewer\nWe have a decent brand with cycle shops. Wal-Mart has it’s own private label which comprises\nthe bulk of it’s sales.\nCandidate\nHmm….could we try to go to other chain retailers like Target and get our product in them? Can\nwe offer to manufacture Wal-Mart’s private label helmets? Can we co-brand Wal-Mart private\nlabel helmets? Can we sign exclusive contracts with cycle shops?\nInterviewer\nThose seem like viable options, though they will take some work. Anything else?\n\nCandidate\nTo achieve top-line growth, the company should also explore getting into new markets by\ndeveloping new products. The company should utilize it’s prowess in helmet manufacturing to\ndevelop and market new products since the helmet industry is stagnating. For instance, if the\nhelmets are made of plastic, the firm should try to leverage it’s current manufacturing and\ndistribution abilities to sell other bike-related plastic products. If this is successful the product\nrange can be expanded further to include plastic products for other sports. Or may be the client\ncan start manufacturing baseball helmets or cricket helmets.\nInterviewer\nGreat! The company overestimated demand and produced 30M helmets. How many must it sell\nto break-even?\nCandidate\nAt break-even,\nPrice x Volume Sold = Fixed costs + Variable Costs x Volume Produced\nDo we have information about the price and the costs?\nInterviewer\nThe price at which the company sells to retailers is $10. The fixed costs include $22M in labor\nand $10M in overheads. Variable costs are $4 per helmet.\nCandidate\nOkay, so\nPrice x Vol = Fixed costs + Variable costs x Volume produced\n$10 x Vol = $22 M + $10 M + $4 x 30M\n$10 x Vol = $152 M\nVol = 15.2 M\nInterviewer\nAnd what if the company has complete visibility of the demand? For instance, it only\nmanufactures on order, say from Wal-Mart? What is the break-even in that case?\nCandidate\nPrice x Vol = Fixed costs + Variable costs x Volume produced\n$10 x Vol = $32 M + $4 x Vol\n(10-4) x Vol = $32M\nVol = 32M/6 = 5.3 M",
  "Goizueta_2006_Atlanta Entertainment": "Atlanta Entertainment\nGiven by Matt Finger, Goizueta MBA ‘05\nInterviewer\nYour client, the city of Atlanta is considering building either a baseball stadium or an aquarium.\nThe city does not have enough funds to build both and must decide between these two options.\nWhat factors will you consider while making the decision?\nCandidate\nI would look at the following factors:\n- How popular is the game of baseball vs. water-borne wildlife in the city?\n- What will be the likely market size and the prices for each facility…in other words, what are\nthe likely revenues for these venues?\n- What are the costs involved – building, maintaining, operating?\n- How many and what substitutes are available? For instance, is there a zoological park in the\ncity? Or perhaps other sporting stadiums?\n- How does the plan compare to other, similar cities? Do they have baseball stadiums or\naquariums?\n- Lastly, I’d consider political factors and associations.\nInterviewer\nYou mentioned finances…in costs there are costs of building, maintaining and running. The\nopportunity cost or the cost of capital is 10%, and cash flows for the aquarium are as following:\nY0 – net costs of $20 M\nY1 – Income of $10 M\nY2 – Income of $11 M\nOn the basis of this information, do you recommend building the aquarium?\nCandidate\nFuture value at Y2 of costs = $24.2 M\nFuture value at Y2 of income = $11 M + $11 M = $22 M\nThis is negative net future value investment. I will not recommend it.\nInterviewer\nThis was an interesting calculation. Instead of the NPV, you calculated the net future value. How\nand why did you do it?\nCandidate\nI just used the compound interest formula. Heck, since it was just 2 years, I used simple interest\nformula and compounded in my head:\nCost\nY0 20\nY1 20 + 10% of 20 = 22\nY2 22 + 10% of 22 = 24.2\nIncome\n\nY1 10\nY2 10 + 10% of 10 = 11\nAlso, Y2 has additional income of 11\nSo total income = 11 + 11 = 22\nNet future value = - 24.2 + 22 = -ve\nNormal procedure is to calculate the NPV. However, I find it easier to multiply than to divide,\nand therefore calculated the NFV, which leads to the same conclusion, only faster.\nInterviewer\nCool. The city projects that if it builds the stadium, it will be able to sell 2500 season’s tickets at\n$1200 each. How many per game tickets must be sold if they are priced at $40 each? We know\nthat annual operating costs are $27 M.\nCandidate\nAt break-even, revenues should equal costs.\n3 M + 40 x Vol = 27 M\n40 X Vol = 24 M\nVol = 2.4/4 M\nVol = 0.6 M\nInterviewer\nIf there are 80 games per year, what should be the seating capacity of the stadium?\nCandidate\nAssuming that the break-even should occur at 25% occupancy:\nPer game tickets = 600K/80 = 7.5 K\nSeason’s tickets (assuming all attend) = 2.5 K\n25% occupancy = 10 K\nStadium capacity = 40 K",
  "Goizueta_2006_Retailer Growth": "From Harvard's case-book\nRetailer Growth\nA major retailer of clothing and household products has been experiencing sluggish growth and\nless than expected profits in the last few years. The CEO has hired you to help her increase the\ncompany's annual growth rate and ultimately its profitability.\n- The retailer has 15 stores located in shopping malls in metropolitan and suburban areas.\n- Total revenue from the 15 stores has declined, despite major back-end cost savings.\nRECOMMENDED SOLUTION\nHigh Level Plan of Attack\n- You need to understand why growth has slowed and profitability has declined despite cost\nsavings.\n- Do different stores experience variations in revenue? Do they all have the same approach to\nselling?\n- Is purchasing behavior of the consumer different in the two areas?\n- Has there been any new competition on the scene? In one area and not the other?\nLay Out Your Thoughts\n- Use the profitability framework. The case tells you that cost savings have been achieved.\nFocus on the revenue side.\n- Focus on the fact that the company has 15 different stores, in two different geographical areas.\nWhat are the key differences between the two in terms of the consumer, competition, and\ngrowth?\nDig Deeper: Gather Facts\n- Are some stores more profitable than others? Yes they are. We see variations throughout.\n- Are there differences in profitability between the metropolitan and suburban stores? Yes there\nare. We see that the suburban stores are more profitable than the urban ones.\n- Is there more competition in the urban areas? No, not really. It's proportionally the same.\n- Do the stores sell the same products? Yes they do. All stores have the same product mix.\n- [Given that all stores sell the same product mix and some are more profitable than\nothers, this should lead you to look at consumer behavior]\n- Do consumers in the suburban areas have different purchasing behavior than the urban\ndwellers? Yes, as a matter of fact, they do. The suburban customer tends to buy more of the\nmajor appliances and electronic equipment than the urban consumer. The urban consumer\nbuys mostly items such as clothing, small furniture items, and small appliances.\n- [You can make the assumption that suburban consumers have higher incomes and\nare in more need of major appliances given the difference in living quarters between\nhouses versus apartments in the city.]\n- Is there a difference in profitability between the goods purchased by the suburban and urban\nconsumers? Yes. Major appliances and TVs and stereos are higher profit items than clothing\nand minor appliances.\n\n- Would you say that the current product mix is more suited for the suburban customer than for\nthe urban? Yes. I guess it is.\nKey Findings\n- The consumer in the city has different needs and purchasing behavior than the suburban\nconsumer. The stores in the city are not catering to the demographics of its surroundings.\n- Unnecessary costs are being incurred through inventory and lost floor space in the city stores,\nresulting in lost revenue for the retailer.\nRecommendations\n- Further analyze the customer for each of the stores and differentiate purchasing behavior and\nincome levels.\n- Cater the product mix according to the customer research findings.\n- Stores that cannot sustain selling low cost items should consider the possibility of closure.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Butcher Shop Process": "Butcher Shop Process\nA fast food chain recently bought a bovine meat-processing outlet to supply it with fresh\nhamburgers and other meets. The shop process is: cows enter from one end of the shop, meat\ngets processed in the middle, and then the meat gets packaged and delivered at the other end.\nThe manager of the butcher shop however could not decide whether to have the cows walk or\nrun into the meat processing room. Can you help him?\nRECOMMENDED SOLUTION\nHigh Level Plan of Attack\n- The first thing you want to do is to understand how much meat can be processed (the\ncapacity) when the cows walk versus run.\n- Then analyze the cost implications of the cows walking versus running.\n- Next, calculate the size of the market and demand for the product.\n- Finally, match demand with supply.\nLay Out Your Thoughts\n- This is a market sizing, operation’s cost analysis question. Try to lay your plan of attack on\npaper in a logical sequence of steps to take.\nDig Deeper: Gather Facts & Make Calculations\n- Shop Capacity\n- Let’s assume that only fresh hamburger meat is processed at the shop. Let’s also\nassume that from each cow, you can make 20 hamburgers.\n- How many hours per day is the shop open for? 10 hours, 5 days a week.\n- Now, if the cows walk in, 10 cows can be processed in one hour, given current labor.\n- This gives us an estimated 2000 hamburgers that can be processed in one day if the\ncows were to walk (20 hamburgers/cow x 10 cows/hour x 10 hours/day).\n- If the cows were to run in, let's assume that 25 cows can be processed in one hour.\nThis gives us 5000 hamburgers per day.\n- Costs\n- Next, we must calculate the costs associated with the two different capacities. Let us\nassume that labor cost increases proportionally to the increase in processed meats,\nand overhead increases, but not proportionally due to some sunk costs, for more\nequipment and other expenses. Here is the breakdown:\n\n- This shows that by running, costs drop by 10 cents on each burger.\n- To estimate revenue, we need to calculate the demand from estimating what the market size\nwould be.\n- Let's assume that the fast food chain has 10 outlets, and the meat-processing factory serves all\n10. Each outlet serves a vicinity of about 30,000 people. Now, let's also assume that there are\nabout 3 other competitors in each vicinity, leaving it with a market share of about 25% of the\ncustomers in each area, for a total of 75,000 potential customers.\n- Of those 75,000, about 40% of them fall within the demographic target, leaving 30,000\ndesired customer.\n- Given the trends in healthy foods, out of the 30,000 desired customers, about a third will be\nallowed by their parents to frequent any one of the establishment on a regular basis - leaving\n10,000.\n- Of the 10,000 customers, each will frequent the establishment about twice a week on average\n- 20,000 visits. Out of these visits, about half order a burger over another item on the menu -\nfor a total of 10,000 burgers a week.\nKey Findings/Recommendations\n- Even though it’s cheaper to produce more burgers, there’s no demand to support it.\n- Have the cows walk. This meets demand and ensures fresh hamburgers.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Juice Producer Profitability": "Juice Producer Profitability\nA major producer of juice is in the business of processing and packaging fruit juice for retail\noutlets. Traditionally, the producer has packaged the juice in 18-ounce carton containers.\nRecently, in response to demand from the market, the producer purchased a machine that\npackages the juice in plastic gallons (36 ounces). Over the next couple of years, sales continued\nto grow on average of 20% per year. Yet, as sales continued to increase, profits steadily\ndecreased. The owner cannot understand why. He hires you to help out.\nRECOMMENDED SOLUTION\nHigh Level Plan of Attack\n- We know that sales have been increasing, so revenue is not an issue. The problem must be\ncosts.\n- Because of the change in packaging, the producer has incurred additional costs that are not\naccounted for, causing profits to decline.\nLay Out Your Thoughts\n- Use the profitability framework. Gather information on the revenue side, but focus mostly on\nthe cost side.\nDig Deeper: Gather Facts/Make Calculations\n- Looking at the revenue side, how much did the producer charge for the 18 oz. carton? $2.00\nper container.\n- For the 36 oz. plastic gallons? For twice the size, the producer figured he would provide an\nincentive to buy by selling them at $3.50 per gallon.\n- How was the cost of the new equipment accounted for in the price? The producer ended up\nraising prices across the board by $.50 on all packages, both cartons and gallons, selling at\n$2.50 and $4.00, respectively.\n- What about cost of packaging? Does it cost the same to package the juice in cartons as it does\nin gallons? Well, I guess not. Plastic is more expensive than the paper carton we have\ntraditionally used. Also, we had to hire more experienced labor to operate the machine\nbecause it is a little more complicated than the carton machine. We figured that because the\ndemand was higher for the gallons – we would cover our costs through increased volume.\n- What about overhead costs? All costs for the factory are added together and divided by the\nnumber of units produced.\n- This should raise alarm bells. This is now clearly an issue of cost allocation. The\nprice on the plastic gallons should be higher due to higher costs. Now you need to see\nto what extent this is affecting the bottom line.\n- Let's try to understand the trend in sales. What percentage of gallons versus cartons is sold?\nThe more our customers notice the gallons, the more they like them. As the overall volume is\nincreasing, plastic gallons have comprised 60% of the sales. The owner has been very pleased\nabout that.\n- It seems to me that it costs more to package in the gallons, yet the price is not higher on a per\nounce basis. In fact, it's lower. Have you done any proper cost allocation to determine which\ntype of product should carry which costs? No, we haven’t.\n\nKey Findings\n- The major finding in this case is the additional costs associated with the plastic gallons were\naveraged out over all units, including cartons. This resulted in a misallocation of costs and\ninappropriate pricing.\n- The plastic gallon products have been priced at a lower rate than they should have been.\nResult: the more gallons the juice producer sold, the more profit the company lost out on.\nRecommendations\n- This firm should conduct a thorough analysis of activity based costing to determine the\noverhead costs and direct costs associated with each item in the product line. They should\nthen use this data to price accordingly.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Chemical Manufacturer Profitability": "Chemical Manufacturer Profitability\nA major chemical manufacturer produces a chemical product used to preserve foods in\ncontainers. Despite an increase in market share, the manufacturer has experienced a decline in\nprofits. The CEO of the company is worried about this trend and hires you to investigate.\nRECOMMENDED SOLUTION\nHigh Level Plan of Attack\nThe first thing we need to figure out is what does \"an increase in market share\" mean?\nRemember, the term \"market share\" is a percentage, and not an absolute number. It could imply\nthat the company has increased its share of the market by beating out the competition, or the\ncompetition exiting the market. It could also mean that the market is actually shrinking, but the\nsales of the company are decreasing by less than those of its competitors.\nLay Out Your Thoughts\nUse the Profitability Framework. Lay out factors that you feel would help from the Value Chain\nanalysis, 4Cs, and 4Ps.\nDig Deeper: Gather Facts\n- Has the company experienced any significant increase in cost in the last couple of years\nrelated to any additional fixed or variable cost? No, costs have been steady.\n- On the revenue side, has there been an increase in the volume of output? Slightly, a little bit\nhigher than the industry average.\n- What about the competition? Have there been any new entrants on the scene? Actually,\ncompetition has decreased. A number of players have exited the industry.\n- Why has that been the case? They were losing money. They felt that the industry had gotten\nsaturated, so they left.\n- Has sales decreased for the industry overall? Yes, there has been a general negative trend in\nthe last few years. There certainly has been less demand for the product.\n- Are substitute products being used? Not really. Preservatives in general are being used less in\nfoods. Fresh food is now the preferred choice for many consumers.\n- What about the makers of food? Are they experiencing decreased volume? Yes, the entire\nindustry has been slowing.\n- Are they forced to lower their prices to survive? They certainly are. Additionally, to lower\ncosts, they are using their leverage to renegotiate price structures of raw materials.\n- So is the company in question forced to lower its prices? Yes. They are gaining market share,\nbut it's because of a number of competitor fallouts.\n- But costs have stayed the same? Yes.\nKey Findings\n- The industry overall is shrinking. To survive, the company in question has been competing on\nprice. It has gained market share at the expense of it competition, forcing some to exit the\nindustry.\n- Its sales have only increased slightly.\n\n- The decrease in price has caused the company to lower its profits, despite the increase in\nmarket share.\n- Profit margin has been lower on a per volume basis.\nRecommendations\n- Focus on cost reduction. If price is the only way to compete, then costs must decrease.\n- Collaborate with the competition to increase leverage in negotiation.\n- Diversify into other chemicals that are in demand. Reduce the risk of market trends via a\nportfolio of products.",
  "Goizueta_2006_VieTire Competition": "VieTire Competition\nA tire manufacturer in Vietnam, VieTire, has been the only player in that market due to high\ntariffs on imports. They dominate the tire industry. As it stands, the tariff is 50% of the total cost\nto produce and ship a tire to Vietnam. Because of the forces of globalization and lower consumer\nprices, the Vietnamese government decided to lower the tariff by 5% a year for the next ten years.\nVieTire is very concerned about this change, as it will radically alter the landscape of the\nindustry in Vietnam. They hire you to assess the situation and advise them on what steps to take.\nRECOMMENDED SOLUTION\nHigh Level Plan of Attack\n- The first thing we need to understand is the current cost structure of VieTire's product.\n- Next, we must determine the impending competitive situation.\n- Then, Calculate the impact the reduction of tariff will have.\n- Finally, recommend specific steps that VieTire can take to protect themselves from increased\ncompetition.\nLay Out Your Thoughts\n- Specify what steps we must take to understand the cost differences now, and in the future, of\nVieTire and its competitors\nDig Deeper: Gather Facts/Make Calculations\n- What would you say are the major costs associated with making a tire? Raw material\ncomprise about 20% of the cost, labor 40%, and all other costs such as overhead 40%. The\naverage tire cost about $40 to make.\n- It seems that labor is a major cost, $16 per tire. Why? Things are done more manually. Most\nof technological advances in the industry have not yet been implemented in Vietnam.\n- What about the cost structure of the competition? An average tire manufacturer in the US\nproduces tires at a cost of $30 each.\n- Assuming shipping cost to Vietnam of $4 each tire, and a tariff of 50%, the average\ncost of an imported tire in Vietnam amounts to $51. So currently, even though the\ncost to produce a tire in the U.S. is much cheaper due to technological advances,\nforeign competitors are out of luck because of the tariff.\n\nKey Findings\n- Depending on what price they are willing to set, the competition will start to think about\nentering the market in year four. In year six, the competition will surely enter as their prices\nbecome lower than domestically produced tires.\n- This analysis assumes that the cost structure for the competition will remain constant. It is\nimportant to note that because of the rapid advances in technology, chances are that the costs\nof producing tires will decrease resulting in competitors entering the market even sooner.\nRecommendations\n- VieTire needs to benchmark against word class tire manufacturers and reengineer production\nmethods and cost structures.\n- They must invest in the latest advances in order to reduce their labor/operations costs.\n- The company should focus on increasing the skills of labor while at the same time contain\ntheir hourly wage.\n- Need to develop loyalty from their customers/consumers in order to lock in a certain\npercentage of the market share.",
  "Goizueta_2006_World View TV Profitability": "World View TV Profitability\nA cable TV company from Canada, World View, had recently entered the US market in the\nnortheast to expand its market share. World View saw this move as an opportunity to capture a\nlarge part of the US market (4MM consumers) in a market with very little competition.\nHowever, in the last couple of years, much to the surprise of management, World View has been\nunable to make a profit. You have been hired to figure out why and advise them on their next\nmove.\nRECOMMENDED SOLUTION\nHigh Level Plan of Attack\n- We need to understand why the company is losing money despite the market being\nuncompetitive.\n- We must analyze both the revenue and cost side of the problem.\n- We should also analyze the differences in viewing behavior and income between the customer\nbase of World View in Canada and in the northeast.\n- We will also determine the strength of any competitors and substitutes.\nLay Out Your Thoughts\n- Use the profitability framework.\n- Focus very heavily on the consumer.\nDig Deeper: Gather Facts/Make Calculations\n- Let's look at costs first. Did World View incur additional costs per customer on average in the\nnew market? No, based on the potential number of subscribers, they have instituted the same\nsystem that was in place. Costs associated with cable wire, debt, maintenance costs, etc. are\nall proportionally the same.\n- What about the number of subscribers. Out of the 4MM potential customers, how many are\nsigned up? Only 2.1 MM.\n- Are other cable companies capturing the remaining market? No, competition is not an issue.\nThose that we have not acquired as customers simply do not have cable.\n- What about substitutes and viewing behavior? How is the consumer in the northeast US\ndifferent from the one in Canada? Well, the Canadian consumer does not rely much on local\nstations for watching TV. Cable is a major source of entertainment and news coverage. In the\nnortheast US, we tend to see consumers shy away from paying the $40 a month. They settle\nfor watching local stations.\n- Does the new market lave a lower income level? Yes, they do, by about 20% on average.\n- What about the local stations? How many are they? Do they meet most of the needs of the\nconsumer? There about 16 local stations that have coverage over the entire northeast. I guess\nthey are doing pretty well by providing programming that the consumer wants.\nYou tend to see the average consumer in the northeast watch regular TV more than Cable\nwhen compared with the Canadian consumer.\n\n- Do these stations have good reception and how much do they charge? They have a very good\nreception and they are part of basic TV, so they are free.\n- Is World View providing any type of programming that the local stations are not providing?\nSome, but the consumers don't seem to be interested. They don 't feel that it's worth $40.\nKey Findings\n- There is a great deal of competition in the area, not from other cable companies, but local TV\nstations.\n- The consumer in northeast US is quite different from the consumer in Canada with respect to\ntelevision viewing habits.\n- Consumers are not willing to pay $40 for a service that they already get for free.\nRecommendations\n- World View could try to cater its current channel offering by offering a smaller package for\nthose that would be interested in couple of cable channels.\n- Scale back its operations to a specific region.\n- Educate the consumer on the extra benefit and new low price.\n- If none of these strategies work, move out of that market.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Le Seine Investment": "Le Seine Investment\nA French soft drink company, Le Seine, is looking to diversify its holdings by investing in a new\nfast food chain in the US. You are hired to determine whether they should pursue this path and, if\nso, how they should go about execution.\nRECOMMENDED SOLUTION\nHigh Level Plan of Attack\n- Understand the company's logic for entering into the fast food industry.\n- Examine the overall trends in the fast food industry, and determine which segment is the most\npromising.\n- Assess the overall demographic changes and major trends in eating habits.\n- Determine what competencies the company can provide that will help it enter this business\nand be successful.\n- What are some of the high level strategies that the company should consider when entering?\nLay Out Your Thoughts\n- Use some elements of the 4Cs, 4Ps, and Porter's Five Forces. Identify which factors you need\nto address and list them in a logical sequence.\nDig Deeper: Gather Facts/Make Calculations\n- Why is the company thinking of investing in the fast food industry and not another? The fast\nfood industry has been experiencing sustainable growth for the last few years, and we believe\nthat it will continue to grow.\n- Why in the US market and not the French? The US is more attractive economically and Le\nSeine has been present in the country for a few years.\n- Does the company know much about the fast food industry and its consumers? Not very much.\nThey're not sure where to enter. The industry as a whole might be growing, but let's think\nabout which segment is growing the most and where it would make sense for the company to\nenter. If we look at the traditional burger outfits, that segment is pretty much dominated by\nthree players: McDonalds, Burger King, and Wendy's. I would think that the barriers to entry\nare pretty high for this segment. You also have pizza, Mexican, chicken, cold cut sandwiches,\nprepared meals (Boston Market).\n- Has the company thought about which to enter? No. But what do you think, at a high level,\nwhich segment should they enter?\n- [Quickly run through the pros and cons of the various segments]\n- Well, if we take a look at the company itself, it is more inclined to be in the prepared\nmeals segment, given that it is French and has a European appeal. If we look at the\ntrends, the population is getting older and more families have two working parents.\nAlso, there seems to be a move towards eating more healthy foods. If we consider the\ncompetition, the segment seems to be at the growing stages, with only one or two\nknown players. The barriers to entry are certainly not as high as some of the other\nsegments.\n\n- To distinguish itself from the competition, it can make food with a French theme,\npriced competitively. The company can also set up shop in major grocery stores, as\nmore people are purchasing prepared foods as part of the their grocery shopping.\n- It would be a fair assumption to say that Le Seine can capitalize on its distribution\nand marketing experience in the US.\nKey Findings\n- There seems to be potential in the prepared food segment (players like Boston Market).\n- Le Seine seems to be a good candidate to enter and take advantage of the present opportunity.\nRecommendations\n- Based on this assessment, Le Seine should enter on a large scale. To offer competitive pricing,\nthey must have economies of scale.\n- Quickly develop strong brand equity. Look at the franchising option. Examine in detail how\nthe most successful fast food outlets operate.\n- Consider acquiring an existing chain versus starting a brand new one.\n- Location is extremely important. Know your customers in every region, and focus on\nconvenience.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Auto Service Expansion": "Auto Service Expansion\nA major auto service chain, Wheeler Dealer, has enjoyed healthy returns on its 30-store\noperation for the past 10 years.\nHowever, management feels that the chain needs to expand, as the current geographical areas in\nwhich they are based have become saturated.\nFor the past couple of years, they have aggressively pursued a growth strategy, opening an\nadditional 15 stores. However, it seems that this approach has had negative returns. For the first\ntime in over a decade, the chain's profits dropped into the negative zone. You were hired to\nfigure out why.\nRECOMMENDED SOLUTION\nHigh Level Plan of Attack\n- You need to understand the nature of the business. What does the auto service entail?\n- Focus on the customer segmentation. Are they serving more than one customer? Any\ndifferences?\n- What is the profit structure of the different offerings?\n- Where did they move? Are the newly formed stores operating differently or serving different\nmarkets than before?\nLay Out Your Thoughts\n- Use the Profitability Framework. Focus on how revenue has changed given the environment.\nDig Deeper: Gather Facts/Make Calculations\n- What type of services has Wheeler Dealer traditionally provided for its customers? There are\ntwo main businesses under each roof: off-the-shelf car parts and the garage mechanical\nservices.\n- Are these services provided as well in the newly developed chains? Yes.\n- Have competitors entered the market stealing market share? A few competitors have entered\nthe market, but not too many. The expansion was planned to explore new markets and prevent\nthe competition from growing.\n- What about price? Have prices gone up to help defray some of the costs associated with\ngrowth? No, they have stayed the same.\n- Given the two types of businesses for each chain, do they have the same profit margin? No. In\nfact, because the garage services cost the business a great deal more and the mechanics are\nvery well trained, we charge a premium. Profit margin on servicing cars has twice the profit\nmargin of off-the-shelf products.\n- Are the customers the same for both businesses? No. The customer that uses the garage\nservice tends to come from a mid-to-high income bracket. Those that use the off the-shelf\nauto parts tend to be of the lower-income bracket. They fix their cars on their own.\n- Where has Wheeler Dealer traditionally been located? Mostly in, or very close to the suburbs.\n\n- Has the geographical location changed as they expanded? Yes, They saw certain urban areas\nas very inexpensive. They located more in inner cities where there are a lot of used car sales.\n- So, would it be fair to assume that the more profitable business, the garage service, has\ndeteriorated and the sale of off-the-shelf parts has increased, causing overall profitability to go\ndown? Yes.\nKey Findings\n- The garage service is the major revenue generator for the business. As they expanded into the\ninner cities, they began to attract the wrong customer. Profit margin on the off- the-shelf\nproducts is not enough to cover costs and make a healthy return for Wheeler Dealer. A price\nincrease is unlikely given price sensitivity.\nRecommendations\n- Scale back from the urban areas. Focus on geographical areas where you can attract the\nsuburban customers who will use the service aspect of the business. Maintain a healthy return\non the car product market from the inner city dwellers.\n- Where possible, drop the garage service in under-performing areas to reduce costs and focus\non the retail end.",

The total number of transactions is around one million per year. On\naverage, about 300K go to the business segment, and 700K to the leisure.\n- Is there a cost associated with each transaction? Yes, each transaction, regardless of which\nsegment, costs $9.\n- [Now you have all the necessary information to calculate the profitability of\ntransactions for each segment. If you run the numbers, you will find the following\ninformation.]\nKey Findings\n- The leisure travelers are draining your profitability. Either the cost per transaction is too high\nor the revenue per transaction made on the leisure is too low.\nRecommendations\n- Benchmark the cost structure of other travel agencies.\n- Negotiate with the airlines on the possibility of charging a premium for leisure tickets or\ncapture a larger commission through cost charged to the customer.\n\n- Look into the possibility of reducing cost per transaction for the leisure travelers.\n- Offer the leisure traveler other products to increase revenue per transaction such as hotel\nbookings and travel packages.\n- Become a niche player and focus only on the business traveler",
  "Goizueta_2006_Hospital Profitability": "Hospital Profitability\nOur client is a 350-bed hospital in a mid-size city. The organization has historically exhibited\nstrong financial performance, and had a 1-3% operating gain each year for the last five years.\nHowever, they are projecting a $12 million operating loss this year, and expect this situation to\nworsen in the future. As a result, the CFO believes that they will be out of cash within five years.\nThey have asked us to identify the source of this sudden downturn, and to come up with\nalternatives to restore them to a break-even position. They are one of the largest employers in the\nmarket, and will not consider layoffs as a possible solution.\nBackground\nThis question addresses company profitability. The interviewer is looking for a candidate’s\nbusiness intuition and ability to apply this intuition to identify potential sources of the problem.\nIn addition, the interviewer is looking for potential solutions to the client’s problem.\nResponse\nCandidate: Profitability is a function of an operation’s revenues and costs. The first thing I’d like\nto focus on is the company’s future revenue stream. As I understand the hospital industry,\nrevenues may be fixed for several years due to long-term contracts with insurers. Is this the case\nfor this hospital?\nInterviewer: Your intuition is correct. Revenues have dropped approximately 15% so far this\nyear due to aggressive pricing on capitated managed care contracts that were signed in January\nand declining admissions and length of stay for their fee-for-service contracts, most of which are\nstill reimbursed on a per diem basis. All contracts are binding for three years, and cannot be\nrenegotiated.\nCandidate: In that case, it is important to understand the company’s cost structure to see if it can\nadjust to this declining stream of revenue. Does the client have considerable fixed costs that will\nbe difficult to reduce in the near term?\nInterviewer: Hospital occupancy is approximately 70%, resulting in high fixed costs that are not\ncovered by the current contribution margin. The organization is currently staffed for 80%\noccupancy.\nCandidate: Since revenue is declining at a fixed rate and fixed costs are high in the short-term,\nthe hospital will have to analyze its variable cost structure. I would surmise that staffing costs are\nthe main source of variable costs. However, the hospital cannot address this due to its policy\nconcerning layoffs. I would think that the other main driver of variable costs for the hospital lies\nin its utilization of resources. Am I headed down the right track?\nInterviewer: In fact, you’re right. The utilization of diagnostic and therapeutic services during a\npatient’s stay is approximately 15% higher than what was expected when contract pricing was\nnegotiated.\n\nCandidate: Given that information, the hospital should focus on changing physician behavior\nsince physicians ultimately control the utilization of resources. The hospital may want to align\nMD incentives with those of the hospital by sharing risk, giving physicians data and education on\ntheir use of resources versus the competition. Other ways to reduce expenses could be to sign\nexclusive contracts with a distributor in order to generate volume discounts and economies in\npurchasing, or by reducing choice by limiting the pharmacy formulary to generics and decreasing\nthe number of vendors utilized for high volume items such as prosthetics and heart catheters.\nInterviewer: That’s a good discussion of cost implications, but have you given up on\nrecommending ways to increase hospital revenue?\nCandidate: Now that you mention it, the situation is not hopeless in this regard. The hospital may\nwant to increase revenue by signing contracts with additional insurers, by putting salaried\nphysicians on staff to guarantee that they admit to our client’s hospital, or by creating an\naffiliated physician organization to increase their share of admissions. In addition, they can\npotentially leverage their distinctive competencies by developing Centers of Excellence that can\nbe marketed to managed-care contractors as an exclusive provider for those services within the\nregion, and possibly outside the region.\nInterviewer: Are there any other solutions that may be feasible?\nCandidate: One final thought that keeps coming back to me centers on the company’s current\ncompetitors. What does the local market look like?\nInterviewer: There are two other 350-bed hospitals in the city. One is an academic medical center,\nthe other a catholic hospital recently acquired by a for-profit chain. Additionally, total\nadmissions in the marketplace have dropped by 5% and total patient days have declined 10%.\nCandidate: In that case the hospital may want to consider affiliating with a competitor in the\nmarket. This may help to decrease capacity across the city by rationalizing the services offered at\neach institution. This may allow one hospital to close, thereby reducing fixed costs.\nGeneral Summary Comments\nThe candidate should fully address the components of this issue (profit = revenue - costs) and\nshould be able to demonstrate an understanding of fixed vs. variable costs. Moreover, the\ncandidate should be able to brainstorm possible solutions to the problem, both from a revenue\nmaximization and cost minimization perspective.",
  "Goizueta_2006_E-Grocery Market-entry": "E-Grocery Market-entry\nThe client is a grocery store chain that is considering whether or not they should enter the\nemerging Internet-based grocery shopping/delivery market in the Boston area. This regional\nchain is currently one of the leaders in the traditional grocery store market in northern New\nEngland.\nIn their core market, two competitors have emerged in the Internet/at-home grocery shopping\nbusiness, and are rapidly gaining market share. One of the companies that has already entered\nthis new marketplace is the client's primary competitor in the traditional market. The second\nplayer is a chain that does not have grocery stores in the target region, but has entered the Boston\narea with Internet shopping delivery services.\nShould the client enter the market? If so, how, and what concerns should they have? If not, how\ndo they protect market share from the emerging market that is threatening to steal business?\nBackground\nThis is a market strategy issue. The interviewer is looking for a discussion of the client's\ncustomers, competitors, costs, core competencies and the overall market dynamics. In addition,\nthe candidate should be able to present a solution and identify the key success factors for this\nsolution.\nResponse\nCandidate: The client must first do some preliminary work examining the market for groceries\ndelivered over the Internet. I would like to get a better sense for the company's current customers,\nas well as potential customers, to see if the Internet is a viable delivery mechanism for the\ncompany. Can you tell me more about the client's customers in the area?\nInterviewer: The client serves primarily upper-middle class customers.\nCandidate: That's important to know. I would guess that prospective users of an Internet-based\ndelivery system are upper-middle class. Can you confirm this and elaborate on the growth\nprospects for this market?\nInterviewer: Your guess is correct. Users of the Internet delivery system are typically upper-\nmiddle class. As far as the market is concerned, home grocery shopping among Internet users is\ngrowing rapidly and the percentage of homes with Internet access is also growing.\nCandidate: We've established that the market is an attractive one, however I still need more\nevidence before presenting a recommendation. I'd like to now turn to the two competitors\ndescribed in your opening. Can you explain their current market share?\nInterviewer: All three local players have an equal market share - roughly 15%.\nCandidate: And can you address recent growth trends among the competition?\n\nInterviewer: The competitor without stores in the target region is gaining market share more\nrapidly than the company with stores in the target region.\nCandidate: We've established pretty convincingly that the market is attractive. I'd like to now\nfocus on our client. Clearly not all companies are prepared to put their operations on the Internet.\nThere are two central issues I'd like to better understand. First, the company's core\ncompetencies—does it have the requisite skills to address the Internet user? Secondly, I'd like to\nunderstand the company's cost structure. Is such a move feasible for the client? Do you have any\ninformation on the company's distribution capabilities? Specifically, is it able to address the\nInternet market?\nInterviewer: The co.'s current distribution facilities are not adequate for the delivery system.\nCandidate: How about the company's employees? Are they sufficiently trained to handle delivery\ntasks associated with the Internet?\nInterviewer: The current employees cannot perform these tasks without more training.\nCandidate: Those are some important considerations to ponder. However, given the market\nattractiveness for Internet groceries, the client would be crazy to pass up this opportunity. Its\ncustomers are Internet users, the competition has already shown a willingness to invest in the\nmarket, and the competitor with no stores in the region (i.e. totally reliant on Internet sales) is\ngrowing the fastest. That said, the company must be willing to invest in this market to succeed.\nFirst, it must improve its distribution capabilities. Further analysis must be done as to whether it\nshould improve its current operations or develop a stand-alone capability exclusively devoted to\nthe Internet market. Next, it must develop an inventory management system so that it can\neffectively track what it orders from suppliers, what customers are ordering, and where the\nproduct is delivered (Internet vs. traditional). Finally, it must spend enough money to cross-train\nits employees so that tasks associated with Internet delivery can be effectively performed.\nInterviewer: Are there any other considerations?\nCandidate: When the company rolls out its Internet operations, it must not disappoint customers.\nMany of the Internet-based customers will be cannibalized from the traditional operations. In\nitself, this is not bad. These customers obviously prefer the alternative, and it's better for the\ncompany to retain them versus losing them to competitors. However, failure to deliver on\nInternet delivery will cause customers to consider switching to the competition. As such, the\ncompany must be sure it can effectively deliver on its promises from the moment it enters the\nInternet market.\nGeneral Summary Comments\nThe candidate does not necessarily have to recommend market-entry for this case. If the\ncandidate believes the company should not enter the market, it must present a compelling\nbusiness reason why and craft creative alternatives for market share protection. In either case, the\nkey components of market strategy must be understood and addressed.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Formula Producer Investment": "Formula Producer Investment\nThe client is a manufacturer and distributor of infant formula. They sell their product nationwide,\nand are in the middle of the pack in terms of market share. They are currently trying to boost\ntheir market share while maintaining profitability.\nThere is a government welfare program called WIC (Women, Infants, Children) that allows\nindividuals living below the poverty level to receive vouchers for infant formula for their\nchildren. Unlike most welfare programs, this one is subsidized by the actual producers of infant\nformula.\nOn a state-by-state basis, infant formula producers bid for the right to be the sole supplier of\ninfant formula to welfare recipients in that state. In addition to paying the government for the\nWIC contract, the client also provides rebates to retailers for WIC sales.\nAs a result, income received from WIC sales is substantially less than that received from normal\nformula sales. In fact, sales to mothers that remain in the WIC program for more than 12 months\nresult in a net loss. In trying to determine how much to bid on a WIC contract for a given state,\nwhat factors should you consider?\nBackground\nThis case is fairly wide open, and presents an issue that is most likely unfamiliar and ambiguous.\nOne challenge will be for the interviewee to find one or more issues that they can explore more\nin-depth. The basic focus of their analysis should deal with the relative profitability of a WIC\ncontract.\nResponse\nCandidate: I think for this case I would first look at who the typical WIC customer is, and the\ndynamic of the relationship, meaning how long are they a customer, and what kind of loyalty is\nthere. Since I don’t have any children, could you tell me more about a typical WIC customer, in\nregards to buying formula?\nInterviewer: Sure. Obviously the typical WIC customer is poor, since this is a form of welfare.\nBut some things you might not know are that 1) the average WIC recipient stays in the program\nfor less than 12 months, 2) mothers typically remain loyal to a brand through infancy for their\nfirst child, but for subsequent children recipients often switch back and forth between brands,\nand 3) infants typically require formula the first 22 months of their life.\nCandidate: Thanks. With that knowledge, I can start to think about the issues facing this\ncompany. In trying to decide the terms for the contract, profitability is the primary driver. There's\nobviously some issue of social-enterprise here, but even so, I think profitability will drive much\nof the decision. Since the WIC recipient gets rebates in addition to the subsidized cost of the\nproduct, we need to quantify that rebate in order to understand what the profitability per recipient\nis. Can you tell me that?\n\nInterviewer: For the purposes of this interview, let's assume that the rebates average an additional\n10% (off of the retail price).\nCandidate: OK. So the profit per customer might be determined by (WIC revenue - rebates -\nCOGS). So if the revenue is $100/customer/year, and the rebates are $10, and COGS are $75, we\nmake $15 per customer per year. As long as we're paying less per customer for these rights to be\nthe sole-supplier, we're in the black.\nInterviewer: For the most part, your logic is correct. But is there anything else that might be a\nfactor in determining profit?\nCandidate: Well, related to the actual profitability of the WIC product I'm not sure. But maybe\nthere are some hidden costs or revenues that I'm not thinking about. In fact, maybe there are\nsome synergistic revenues that the company can achieve. If they get the contract, that gets them\nadditional shelf-space in the stores. And not just WIC recipients shop in the stores. So maybe\nthey will be able to increase market-share, just by being on the shelf. Of course, they are getting\nfull retail price for those sales. So I might add in an additional sales minus COGS to the equation.\nBut to try and get an idea of that figure might be tough. How long to these contracts last?\nInterviewer: Typically, several years.\nCandidate: Ok, so knowing that a contract is several years, say 5, we can begin to get a total\ndollar value for the contract. If we know how many WIC recipients there are in this state that\nwe're bidding, we can calculate expected revenues. Also, if we can get an idea of how much shelf\nspace we would have, we can quantify the synergistic sales.\nInterviewer: Good. I'm not going to make you go through the math on it, because we're about out\nof time, but you're right. There are 1.2 million WIC recipients in the state, and shelf-space is\nawarded based on volume sales. So for this company to get the contract, it can help them have\nmore sales volume, and thus more shelf-space, and hopefully then more market share.\nGeneral Summary Comments\nUltimately, they should come up with some sort of explanation for how numbers would be run to\nestimate an appropriate contract bid. One example might be:\n(WIC revenue - rebates - COGS) + (synergistic non-WIC revenue - COGS) >= Contract Bid\nCOGS takes into account economies of scale.\nReal world situation is that synergies are strong, and WIC recipients bounce in and out of\nprogram but stay loyal to product for first-borns. Not only are the synergies positive, but also on\naverage WIC recipients are profitable because they pay retail for nearly half of the formula that\nthey purchase over the first 22 months of their child's life.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Pharmaceutical Product-launch": "Pharmaceutical Product-launch\nOur client is the U.S. pharmaceutical division of a multi-national corporation. In about six\nmonths the division will receive FDA approval to launch an anti-depressant drug. Despite this\napparent good news from the FDA, the U.S. division is not elated. It has concerns over the\nmarket potential for this drug and its ability to reach the key prescribers in this therapeutic\ncategory. We have been asked to help determine whether they should 1) launch alone, 2) co-\nmarket with a partner, or 3) sell, license or swap the drug.\nThe concerns over market potential center on whether the drug can gain adequate competitive\nadvantage in a market segment having two dominant, patent-protected competitors and nearly\n100 generic competitors. Additionally, a higher technology antidepressant, which appears to\noffer therapeutic advantages, was recently introduced by a competitor.\nGaining the professional endorsement of psychiatrists is crucial to success in this therapeutic\ncategory since they write approximately half of the prescriptions for antidepressants. However,\nthe division has no experience marketing drugs to this physician group.\nConsequently, it would have to hire a sales force and/or enter into a co-marketing agreement to\ngain access to psychiatrists through someone else's force. The client would be able to leverage its\nexisting sales force to reach the other half of the prescribers (Internal Medicine Specialist and\nFamily and General Practitioners).\nHow would you help them decide whether to 1) launch alone, 2) co-market with a partner, or 3)\nsell, license or swap the drug to a third party?\nCommentator: Note here what is being asked, \"How would you help them decide.\" What is not\nbeing asked is \"Which is the correct option to choose?\" The Interviewer is looking more for how\nthis problem is approached than for the \"correct\" answer. Also note that it is totally appropriate\nto take some time to organize your thoughts before launching into the case discussion.\nResponse\nCandidate: In helping the client decide which option they should choose, I will want to guide\nthem to the option that will create the most value. To understand main value drivers (i.e.,\nprofitability drivers), I will first explore the market attractiveness and our competitive position\nwithin that market in order to determine revenue potential. After that, I will explore the major\ncost issues. Starting with the revenue, I'll want to understand first what the overall market\nrevenue opportunities are for this type of drug in addition to our product specifically. Now, the\nclient expressed concern over the market potential for this drug. How big is the market and what\nis its potential growth rate?\nCommentator: Here the Candidate has done several things. First, the Candidate has stated the\noverall objective, value creation. Next, the candidate stated the method of walking through this\nproblem, looking at revenue by using a market economics and competitive position framework,\nthen looking at costs. The Candidate provided a roadmap. Now the interviewer understands the\n\napproach and expected direction of questioning. This helps the interviewer understand the\nstudent's thought process - how he or she thinks through business problems.\nInterviewer: The overall antidepressant drug market is relatively attractive at $1.1 billion per\nyear and is growing well in excess of the population growth rate.\nCandidate: You mentioned that concerns over market potential center on whether the drug can\ngain adequate competitive advantage in a market segment having \"two dominant, patent-\nprotected competitors and nearly 100 generic competitors.\" You also mentioned that a higher\ntechnology drug had entered the market. Is the antidepressant market segmented by technology?\nInterviewer: Yes.\nCandidate: And the two patent-protected competitors along with the 100 generic competitors are\nwithin our technology segment?\nInterviewer: Correct.\nCandidate: So, the overall antidepressant market is attractive at $1.1 billion, but within that\nmarket, there are segments based on different types of technology that may or may not be\nattractive.\nInterviewer: That's correct.\nCandidate: What is the technology associated with our client’s product?\nInterviewer: Tricyclic antidepressants.\nCandidate: How fast is this technology segment growing?\nInterviewer: As a matter of fact, substitution by the new technology may cause a decline in sales\nover the next 5 years. Additionally, the existing competitive environment is very intense and will\nonly increase if the market shrinks.\nCandidate: So, the overall segment is not very attractive.\nInterviewer: Correct.\nCandidate: What percent of the volume do the two main competitors have?\nInterviewer: In our own technology segment, the leader has approximately 10% and the number\ntwo player has about 4%. The rest of the 100 competitors each has less than a 2% market share.\nBy comparison, the new technology has captured a 20% market share of the total antidepressant\nmarket.\n\nCandidate: How much will our client's product be able to differentiate itself within our\ntechnology segment?\nInterviewer: Not much. In a market research study we commissioned, the product was seen as\nvery similar to the number two product in our technology segment, slightly inferior to the\nnumber one product, and slightly better than the generic products. The new technology was\nviewed as far better due to a lower level of sedation.\nCandidate: So to summarize the market environment, although the anti-depressant market is\nattractive, the segment that we would be participating in is relatively unattractive and runs the\nrisk of becoming smaller and more competitive over time. Additionally, within this unattractive\nsegment, we have limited ability to differentiate ourselves relative to our competitors, and thus,\nwill not be able to charge a premium price. I would think that this unattractive market and\nrelatively undifferentiated position within that market would translate to a lower market share. I\nwould estimate that our share might be lower than either of the branded products given our new\npresence in the market, say maybe a 2-4% share and this, like the rest of the segment, would\nprobably decline over the next couple of years.\nInterviewer: That sounds about right.\nCommentator: In understanding the revenue potential, the Candidate did several key things.\n1) Disaggregated the antidepressant market.\n2) Established the overall attractiveness of the relevant market segment.\n3) Established the client's relative attractiveness to competitors within that segment.\nThis enabled the Candidate to come to the correct conclusion that an undifferentiated position\nwithin a relatively unattractive market will limit the revenue potential. Also, note that the\nCandidate is doing most of the talking. Use the interviewer to clarify questions or provide\ninformation, but the Candidate must lead the discussion.\nCandidate: Knowing that our revenue potential is relatively low puts more pressure on\nminimizing the costs if we were to market the drug. I want to see what area within the cost\nstructure impacts profitability the most. What percent of net sales is COGS?\nInterviewer: About 20%\nCandidate: And what is the bulk of the remaining line items?\nInterviewer: Most of it is selling expense. There are some overhead/admin and advertising and\npromotional expenses, but most of it is selling expenses.\nCandidate: So, selling expense is the largest portion of the cost structure, which means that\nwhichever option we choose, launching alone vs. with a partner will certainly impact the selling\nexpense (in addition to the number of prescribers reached, thus revenue potential).\nCommentator: You can pick up good “tips” here. Spend time on things having high impact and\nfeel free to test and see how important they are. Tests might include how large something is as a\n\npercentage of sales, how important it is to the customer, or how much of an impact it has on\nmanufacturing economies, etc.\nCandidate: In understanding the effect of the co-market agreement on number of prescribers\nreached, I think it would be helpful if I could get an idea of who makes the purchasing decision.\nInterviewer: Well, there are four main parties involved. There are the manufacturers (such as our\nclient), the doctors (who prescribe the drug), the druggists (who fill the prescription) and the\npatient (who initiates the transaction). Selling is concentrated on the doctors, since they are the\ngroup that determines if medication is needed and, if so, what type.\nCandidate: Is the growth in managed care going to influence the dynamics of this?\nInterviewer: Yes, but for the purposes of our work, let’s not address that.\nCandidate: So, for the purposes of our work, the doctors make the purchasing decisions, this\nincludes two groups of physicians, the Psychiatric group and the Internal Medicine/General\nPractitioner group.\nInterviewer: Correct.\nCandidate: You noted that we don’t currently have connections to psychiatrists. This group\nprescribes half of the antidepressants. Can we launch the drug by only marketing to IMs and\ngeneral practitioners and ignoring psychiatrists?\nInterviewer: No, they are at the top of the pyramid of influence and thus must endorse the drug\nbefore their colleagues in the IMP/GP will endorse it.\nCandidate: So if we are to market this product, we cannot do so without the Psychiatric group.\nThe weight of the decision then becomes a matter of what is the most efficient and effective way\nto reach them—either through a newly hired sales force or with a co-marketing agreement.\nInterviewer: Correct.\nCandidate: What are the advantages and disadvantages of marketing the drug ourselves?\nInterviewer: In terms of having our own sales force, the main benefit would be that we would be\nconcentrating on our product only and this may help sales. On the downside however, the cost of\nthis focus is all attributed completely to our product, and having a dedicated sales force\nrepresenting only one product would be expensive.\nCandidate: Do you have any other psychotheraputic drugs in development or plans to expand this\npart of your portfolio through licensing?\nInterviewer: Nothing is planned for the next three years.\n\nCandidate: So by entering a co-marketing agreement, the costs of the sales force is spread across\nseveral products, and, if the co-marketer did not have a competing product, then our product\nwould get the appropriate selling attention warranted. Also, since this sales force has existing\nrelationships with the psychiatrists and doesn’t need to take time to further establish these\nrelationships, sales of our product might peak sooner. So, all in all, I would think that if we were\nto market this product, it would be a less costly and higher value option to enter into a co-\nmarketing agreement rather than go it alone.\nCommentator: Here, as with most case interviews, the Candidate has the opportunity to go\n“deep” into an issue. The Candidate has chosen to do this here with one type of cost, the sales\nforce. The Interviewer is looking to see if the Candidate can identify some of the key “value”\ndrivers of the function being explored. In the case of the sales force, the Candidate correctly\nidentified the key value drivers as being:\n1) The ability to spread the cost of a sales call across multiple products.\n2) The ability to choose a co-marketer that needs this product in their existing product line.\n3) The ability to leverage an existing psychiatric sales force infrastructure to reach peak sales\nsooner.\nRemember, there are many value drivers. We have touched on a few, but don’t be concerned\nabout identifying the “right” ones, just try to identify what type of issues affect the situation the\nmost.\nInterviewer: OK, and what about the third option, to sell, license or swap the drug to a third\nparty?\nCandidate: Again, the client would want to choose the option that was more value creating.\nThere could be several reasons for going with the third option:\n1) We might sell our drug because the sum of the promotional or overhead costs may make it\nunprofitable for us to market whereas a company having a similar product line might be able\nto carry this product at a very small incremental cost.\n2) We might license it for the same reasons we would sell it.\n3) We might swap it if we could find a company needing this type of drug while having a drug\nthat might fit more with our existing infrastructure.\nIn any case, for the options being considered, I would want to forecast cash flows and discount\nthem back to see what option is more value creating before making a final recommendation.\nInterviewer: OK, thank you for your input on how to approach this problem.\nCommentator: You’ll note here, that the Candidate doesn’t actually make a final\nrecommendation. This is fine. The Candidate has demonstrated how he would approach the\nproblem, and in doing so, has hit on many of the key issues you would find in a real client case\nsituation. Recapping the steps the Candidate took into evaluating the client’s options:\nOn the revenue side:\n1) Segmented the market to the appropriate technology level.\n2) Determined that the segment was unattractive .\n3) Determined that the client’s product was not significantly differentiated.\n4) Concluded that for these reasons, the revenue potential was limited.\n\nOn the cost side:\n1) Determined that selling expense was a key component to profitability.\n2) Determined that the Psychiatric group needed to be included in the selling efforts.\n3) Determined that it would be less expensive to co-market vs. go it alone.\n4) Determined that there are other considerations to evaluate when comparing co-marketing vs.\nselling, licensing, or swapping the product.\nInterviewer: Provide summary comments and wrap-up.",
  "Goizueta_2006_British Times": "British Times\nYou're a new senior strategy associate and have just finished your orientation training. You are\nimmediately assigned to our British Times team.\nThe British Times is an upscale, highly respected newspaper. It is the most widely read\nnewspaper in Great Britain, especially its very strong business and financial section. The paper is\na cross between the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, both in content as well as in\nreputation.\nThe team has already had one meeting with the newspaper's online spin-off: BritishTimes.com.\nYou are going to join the team for the second meeting, which will be held with only the CEO of\nthe BritishTimes.com. Currently, their web site is nothing more than an online version of the\nnewspaper, otherwise called brochureware.\nThe newspaper's and the web spin-off’s single biggest asset is the highly respected brand name:\nBritish Times. The purpose of this second meeting is for the consulting team to present its\nresponse to the CEO's current predicament: how to realize greater revenues from their current\nonline spin-off (BritishTimes.com).\nCompany Background:\nYour team has provided you with the following information as background about\nBritishTimes.com:\n- BritishTimes.com conducted a viewer survey, receiving a high enough number of responses\nto be statistically significant, allowing them to feel comfortable using the following\ninformation for planning purposes.\n- Their web site has a large number of hits, only 30% fewer unique visitors than the\nnumber 1 site in the UK.\n- Their hits are from viewers in the 75th percentile of customer income.\n- Their viewers are also highly educated: 60% have a university education and 30% of\nwhom have graduate degrees.\n- BritishTimes.com is a spin-off from the newspaper.\n- However, the same parent corporation owns both.\n- The CEO of the dot-com does not report to the CEO of the newspaper.\n- The dot-com CEO has worked for the newspaper for a long time and knows its\noperations well.\n- The brand name is very strong in the UK, but not outside.\n- The newspaper's content is primarily focused on the UK, but it does have an\ninternational section.\n- The CEO wants the dot-com to use the newspaper's content and brand, but otherwise\nhas no need to connect to the newspaper.\nYour Challenge:\nCreate 3 or more ideas for the BritishTimes.com company to increase their revenue through their\nInternet strategy.\n\nPossible Solution:\nCandidate: In general, it's fair to say that the bulk of Internet revenues comes from three sources:\nadvertising, subscriptions, and transactions. I think that the key to helping the CEO is to tailor\nthese initiatives to British Times.com core assets.\n[Great way to start. The candidate did not try to use an ill-fitting framework such as 3Cs or 5\nforces to approach this case. Instead he's showing a good understanding of the Internet's major\nsources of revenues. He also acknowledges that further discussion of the company's core assets is\ncritical to formulating a robust solution.]\nInterviewer: Good points. Can you give me more details on each of these sources of revenues?\nCandidate: Well let's look at advertising first. We could suggest two avenues: banner ads and\ncorporate sponsorship. Upscale or corporate banner ads such as insurance companies, banks, or\nbrokerage firms would make a lot of sense with our audience. They are highly educated and\nmore importantly, have the highest level of disposable income. In addition to banner ads, we\nshould look into corporate sponsorship. We should take full advantage of the fact that the strong\nbusiness section can obtain corporate sponsorships; for example, banks or e-trade companies pay\nfor their section of the site.\n[Well-structured answer. The candidate is using the case facts to support his answer.]\nInterviewer: Good. They do some of that already but probably not as much as they could. You\nalso mentioned other sources of revenues. Could you explain your subscription model?\nCandidate: We could imagine a three-tier approach. For example, in tier 1, readers could have\naccess to today's news for free. For a small fee, Tier 2 subscribers could research up to one-\nweek-old articles in the archive. Finally, in the last tier, subscribers could have access to the\nentire archive.\nInterviewer: Coming from a traditional publishing company, they are fairly familiar with these\ntwo models. I would be interested in hearing more about your third option.\nCandidate: One way to \"monetize\" their attractive audience would be by offering targeted\nproducts and services. Some examples could be a tollbooth model similar to Amazon Z shop\nconcept or selling tabs on their site. This would clearly require a deep analysis of the competitive\nlandscape and of the company's capability (technical, people...) to start a completely new line of\nbusiness. These products or services would have to be:\n- High margin,\n- Upscale,\n- Highly profitable vertical businesses; for instance: golf store, tax advice, investment advice,\nupscale travel (cruises, etc.)\nInterviewer: Golf equipment? This is interesting. How would you go about sizing the market for\ngolf equipment in the UK?\n[The interviewer decides to test the candidate’s ability to do some real time analysis, to articulate\na methodology, and to make reasonable and explicit assumptions in order to arrive at a ballpark\n\nestimate. Here the interviewer could have chosen to discuss more in detail how the candidate\nwould have thought about launching a completely new line of service.]\nCandidate: To determine the golf store's (equipment only) first year total revenue, we would\nhave to figure out the following:\n- The population of the UK\n- The percentage connected to the Internet in the UK\n- The number who browse this site\n- The number who browse the golf store\n- The number who buy from this site: the buy to browse ratio\n- The average amount spent per transaction\n- The number of times they buy per year\n- The commission received by BritishTimes.com\nThere are approximately 60 million people living in the UK. If we assume that a third of them\nare connected to the Internet, we have: 60M x 1/3 = 20M\n[It's always a good idea to take numbers that are easy to manipulate. Do not hesitate to round up\nthe number to help your calculations. The examiner is not looking for an accurate answer.]\nIf we assume that 20% of the people connected will visit the British Times site, we now have:\n20M x 20% = 4 million visitors\nNot all of them will click on the golf site. Probably about 20% will do. We can now estimate the\nnumber of people browsing the golf site:\n4M x 20% = 800,000 visitors\nIf we assume that only 10% of them will actually purchase on the site, we now have:\n800,000 x 10% = 80,000 buyers.\nEach buyer may spend on average $100 each time they visit and they may visit the site 2 times\neach year.\nIf we assume a 5% margin, we now have a rough idea of the golf equipment first year revenues:\n80,000 x $100 x 2 x 5%= $800,000",
  "Goizueta_2006_The Video Store near HBS": "The Video Store near HBS\nTwo business school classmates laud their entrepreneurship intentions and mock your interest in\nentering the management consulting industry. They decide that despite trends that indicate\notherwise, what is needed is a video rental store closer to the HBS campus.\nThey try to convince you to join, but in your infinite wisdom you instead join a prominent\nstrategy consulting firm in Boston.\nTheir first two years meet unprecedented success. They buy matching Porches and a townhouse\nin Beacon Hill. Needless to say, each time you meet up for social occasions, they share with you\n(mostly with tongue in cheek) their success and an \"I told you so\" attitude. You handle their jabs\nwell, as you feel you have had a terrific experience at your consulting firm.\nThe story, however, changes in about 12 months. Despite two and a half years of dramatic profit\nand revenue growth, profits have dramatically fallen. They call you (with a fair amount of egg on\ntheir face) and say \"we don't know what happened and our mortgage and car payments are\ngetting tougher to meet. Can you help us? We know that you help CEO's of large companies get\nto the bottom of their issues.\" With more than a little satisfaction and justice in your voice you\nagree to help. What do you think the problem is?\nSuggested Questions:\nThis is an example of a case where the student must probe to get to the heart of the matter. The\nstudent needs to ask questions which first diagnose the situation and then (and only then) talk\nabout causes of the situation and then (and only then) talk about areas of improvement.\nHere are questions that the student should ask to get to the analysis that will help them diagnose\nthe problem:\n- Have costs increased?\n- Have revenues declined?\n- Have prices been changed?\n- Have new video stores opened in the area?\n- Are fewer customers coming to the store?\n- Are customers renting fewer videos?\n- Have other entertainment venues opened in the area?\n- Have their been economic changes in the area?\nThese key questions will get behind what is happening (competitive changes, pricing\nadjustments, macro factors, people not coming to the store, or people just not renting as many\nvideos, etc.)\nSuggested \"Excellent\" Response:\nThis is an example of a case that is founded in 3C's type issues. The student has to diagnose the\nproblem and find out what exactly is going on and then find out what is causing it. This is how\nefficient analysis is performed:\n\nCandidate: If profits have declined then I assume that either revenues have declined or costs have\nincreased, what is the case?\nInterviewer: Revenues have decreased.\nCandidate: Why would you think that cost is probably not the problem?\nInterviewer: Video rental is a high fixed cost business - rent, videos, and labor are all fixed in the\ncontext of rental revenue. Thus, the business' profits will be susceptible to changes in revenues\n(capacity utilization). Revenues are made up of the number of videos we rent in a year and the\nprice we charge.\nCandidate: Has the management changed the price of the videos?\nInterviewer: No. What does that tell you?\nCandidate: That means that either fewer customers are coming to the store or each customer on\naverage is renting fewer videos. Which is it?\nInterviewer: How would you figure that out?\nCandidate: The security system probably has a counter so that could tell us store traffic, and\nclearly the register receipts could give us number of videos rented per day. We can look at that\ndata last year versus this year and determine whether there is a traffic problem or share of wallet\nproblem.\nInterviewer: Excellent. If you found out it was a share of wallet problem, what would you think\nmight be the problem?\nCandidate: Share of wallet problems are often driven by internal execution problems (bad\nselection, poor service, etc) whereas, traffic is often external (or market) problems.\nInterviewer: Again, excellent. The data shows that traffic has fallen. What now?\n[Here the student should begin to think about hypothesis development. They have diagnosed the\nproblem... i.e. fewer customers are coming into the store.]\nCandidate: If traffic has fallen, it is either a macro factor or a competitive situation. My\ninclination is that video rentals are not that impacted by economic factors, so it is probably a\ncompetitive situation. Has a new store opened in the area?\nInterviewer: No.\nCandidate: Has a new movie theatre opened?\nInterviewer: No.\n\nCandidate: Hmm... That is surprising. I was sure that this was a competitive situation and we\nhave a fixed pool of rental community (or movie interested community) and that once a new\nstore opened regardless of how good it was, it took share from my client’s store.\nInterviewer: Let me ask you something and maybe this will help you along. What business is\nyour client in?\nCandidate: They are in the video rental business or the entertainment business or leisure\nbusiness... I see there could be other entertainment preference shifts or options, etc.\nInterviewer: That is good intuition, but have you fully defined your client’s business? What does\nyour client do? What purpose to they serve?\nCandidate: They rent movies for people to watch at home. They are in the home entertainment\nbusiness and specifically in the home movie entertainment business. That means that the\ncompetitive set is anybody who provides movies in the home. Not just video stores.\nInterviewer: Excellent. What do you think is going on?\n[Here the student has now diagnosed the problem and can make a very good hypothesis that\neither delivery, cable, PPV, or new Movie on Demand technology has infiltrated the market or is\nexperiencing rapid growth, reducing the market size for video rentals at stores.]\nSummary Comments\nThere is no one right way to approach cases. Structure your case interviews to (1) perform\nstructured analysis and fact gathering to properly diagnose the problem; (2) share your logic and\nhypothesis whenever you can; (3) drive to an answer/assessment.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Fast Food Profitability": "Fast Food Profitability\nSix months out of HBS, a frustrated classmate calls you to complain that the fast food burger\njoint that he bought has been steadily losing money for the last 3 months. He wants to know what\nyou think he should do about it. Where do you start?\nSuggested Questions:\nThis is an example of a case where virtually no information is provided and the student needs to\ntake a minute to figure out where to start probing. In this type of case, the student is evaluated\nbased on the number of factors questioned up front plus the ability to logically pare down that\nlist to get at the heart of the matter.\nHere are some of the initial questions the student should ask:\n- Have revenues decreased?\n- Have costs increased?\n- Have prices increased?\n- Was the store making money 3 months ago? What has changed?\n- Is there new competition?\n- Has there been a major economic change in the area?\n- Was there a major event like someone getting sick? Health code violation? Crime?\nThese answers will help to frame the extent of the required analysis.\nSuggested \"Excellent\" Response:\nCandidate: What do you mean by \"losing money\"? Have profits declined or is the business in the\nred?\nInterviewer: Profits have declined.\nCandidate: Have revenues decreased? Costs increased? or both?\nInterviewer: Revenues have decreased.\nCandidate: If revenues have decreased, there are either fewer paying customers or the customers\nare spending less when they visit. Which is the case?\nInterviewer: While they could both play a role, in this case, there are actually fewer customers.\nFewer customers could be due to external factors like new competition, change in eating habits,\nlocal changes like a major business closing in the area. There are also internal factors to consider\nsuch as poor food quality, higher prices, or a major event like someone getting sick or a health\ncode violation.\nCandidate: Recognizing that there are likely many factors involved, is the issue primarily internal\nor external?\nInterviewer: The issue is external and is driven by a new competitor that opened across the street.\n\nThis new competitor must be offering a better value to have made such an impact on the burger\njoint.\nCandidate: What is their value proposition? Are they offering a different type of food? Is it better\nquality? Is there a price disparity?\nInterviewer: They serve chicken dinners and appear to offer a completely different experience.\nHow would you get a deeper understanding of their value proposition?\nCandidate: First, I would visit and learn everything that I can from what I see and experience\nfirst hand. How is the quality of the food? Are the prices reasonable? Do they offer healthier\noptions and more variety? How is the service? Cleanliness? How is the facility laid out? Do they\nhave more parking? Easier access? Once I get a first hand view of the competition, I would take\na hard look at the burger business and the value proposition they are offering. The same\nquestions would apply.\nCandidate: Next, I would do some primary research including customer interviews at both\nlocations. The focus of these interviews is to discern the differences in perception between the\ntwo locations. 1 would pay some customers to go to each restaurant and rate the food and\nexperience. I would also determine how many of the customers are former burger customers but\nnow are exclusively chicken customers, versus how many visit both, and how many are\ncompletely new to the chicken place but would not visit the burger restaurant.\nCandidate: Armed with the data on what customers' value, I would then create a set of options to\nevaluate. There are likely a number of areas that need improvement including new menu options,\nimproved facility layout, better taste/quality. Which will drive most traffic back into the\nrestaurant fastest? Which give the largest return on investment? After analyzing the alternatives\nbased on the chosen criteria, I would prioritize them and develop an action plan to include timing\nand responsibilities.\n[At this point, the case could go in several directions from leadership and project management\nissues, to brand marketing and promotion, to financial decisions about whether to close the\nfacility.]\nSummary Comments:\nThis type of case can be very intimidating since it is broad and ill-defined. The interviewer may\nnot provide much guidance or detail; increasing the stress level. When faced with an interview of\nthis type, the student should try to remain calm and methodical. Writing down the alternatives\nand crossing them out as they are ruled out is a good way to show their thought process.\nThinking aloud is encouraged. The student should take a little time in the beginning to frame the\nissue so as not to develop a hasty hypothesis and head down the wrong path.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Automobile Product-design": "Automobile Product-design\nThe director of marketing at an automobile manufacturer suggests changing the current design,\nwhere two separate keys operate the ignition and the doors to a design where one key operates all\nlock mechanisms. How do you think about whether this a good idea or not?\nSuggested Sample Response:\nThe goal of any business including automobiles is profit throughput that can be measured by the\nNet Present Value impact of the proposed change.\nFor the proposed change to have a positive impact on profit throughput, the change must be a net\npositive of change in cost structure or product demand weighed against the investment needed to\nimplement the change. An expanding of demand in this case must come from the product\nmeeting customer needs better than the direct competition or substitutes. Customer needs that\nthis product may address are simplicity, security, and cost of ownership (related to security). One\nshould also consider if the improvement is defensible or would be easily copied.\nFor cost structure, the relative expense of using what is assumed to be the more complex locking\nmechanism of the ignition on the door and trunk (assumed 5 locks that would be more complex)\nwould have to be weighed against the reduced cost of developing or purchasing separate key and\nlock mechanisms. As most automobile manufacturers are very large, it is assumed that the\nsimpler locking mechanism needed for the doors could be reused across many product lines or\npurchased from large parts suppliers who supply the industry as whole and the development cost\nof a separate locking mechanism would be low.\nTherefore, the change in cost structure will be driven by the relative cost difference of buying 6\ncomplex locking mechanisms vs. 5 simple locking mechanisms and l complex mechanism. It is\nassumed that a more complex locking mechanism is needed for the ignition. Therefore, the\nhypothesis is that the net change of cost position is negative. It is also assumed that the market\npower of buying more complex locking mechanism would not significantly impact the price\ncharged by suppliers or cost basis if developed internally. This hypothesis would be easy to\ncheck by looking at the relative cost position of the different locking mechanisms and the\ndiscount structure available for mass purchasing the various locking mechanisms.\nOn the demand generation side, the product would have to create a net positive in demand across\nthe customer needs of simplicity, security, and cost of ownership. The fact that the marketing\ndirector suggested this change hints at the fact that customers may demand the increased\nsimplicity of only carrying one key. This does not seem intuitively true as the two keys are\nalmost always carried on the same key ring so the relative improvement to simplicity is probably\nminimal.\nFor security, there are two factors to consider, the theft of valuables in the car and the car itself.\nIf more complex locking systems were to improve the security to valuables, then the value of\ngoing with the more complex locking system on the doors of the car may be a positive. The\nassumption, however, is this is not the case as door locks are typically compromised not by\n\npicking the lock but by compromising the areas around the lock (i.e. Slim Jim). Also, security\nsystems, which are becoming more common on cars, mute the affect of a more complex locking\nmechanism, as the key lock mechanism becomes the non-primary mode of defense. I do not see\nhow moving to one key would impact the chance of theft of the entire car, as in either case the\nsame locking mechanism would have to be beaten. This also means the cost of ownership, which\ncould have increased if the change of car theft increased due to insurance premiums, would\nexhibit no affect.\nThe customer reaction to a single key mechanism could be tested through surveying or product\npilots where a sample set of customers are given actual cars with one key and asked to gauge\ntheir reaction. Or larger regional pilots could be run and the change in demand affect measured.\nThe investment required to implement the change of eliminating a separate key and lock for the\ndoors and ignition is assumed to be minimal as key locking mechanisms are fairly standardized\nand the ignition key lock, which is probably more complex, could be transferred to the doors and\ntrunk with minimal amount of rework of the parts assembly infrastructure for building the auto.\nThe primary investment cost would then be the cost of piloting or surveying for the increase in\ncustomer demand by implementing the change. Surveying and piloting costs can be significant,\nbut it is assumed a cheaper survey would suffice in this case to gauge demand so investment\ncosts would be minimal.\nThree final possible points to consider on demand generation. One, an increase in demand is\nnecessary but not sufficient to improve profit throughput, as the company also needs to be able to\nmeet the new demand generated. As auto manufactures almost always have an excess of capacity,\nthis is not an issue. Two, even if this change was beneficial it could be easily copied by\ncompetitors and it is assumed that the change would not provide any lasting brand advantage in\nthe customers mind or raise the demand of the sector as a whole.\nTherefore, in the long run, the cost reduction benefits would override the decision to go forward\nand we have already argued the affect would be negative. A final factor that should be\nconsidered is the assumption that the majority of cars sold in the US in the past have included\ntwo keys and the two keys have most likely generated a lot of unanticipated use that may be hard\nto anticipate that might cause customers to reject the change. So, from a customer perspective, I\nwould want to see the demand for this from customers to be strong and the benefits large before\nimplementing a change.\nBecause it does not appear the proposed change would positively impact cost position or increase\ndemand significantly, the recommendation is against the proposed change. I recommend even\nagainst investing to gauge customer demand as the long run benefit would be in cost position and\nthe assumption here is that the affect is negative.\nSummary Comments\nThis candidate starts with a framework and works through to a hypothesis and how the answer\nmight be tested. All the customer factors or cost impact that could be considered are obviously\nnot included, the interviewer should look for a structured presentation that arrives at a hypothesis\nwith ideas how to test and a proposed answer.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Syzygy Supercomputers Case": "Syzygy Supercomputers Case\nSituation: Syzygy Supercomputers is a large international fully integrated computers and\ncommunications company with annual revenues of approximately $20 billion U.S.\nComplication: Syzygy’s profits have been declining steadily over the past several years\nAction: Your consulting firm has been hired to evaluate the cause of the problem and to\nrecommend solutions\nSyzygy’s historical costs, revenues, and profits are:\nWorldwide telecommunications computing market (today):\n\nThis graph plots Syzygy’s absolute market share (AMS) vs. its relative market share (RMS)\nThis chart compares companies’ R&D with their degree of technical leadership\n\nSyzygy’s R&D expenses for supercomputers and their selling prices are shown over time\nGeneral Comments\nThis is a challenging case that tests several relevant concepts, and is heavy on chart interpretation.\nThe candidate will need to use logical, inductive reasoning to discover and highlight the relevant\nideas and insights.\nSolutions\nFirst, give the relevant background information. Based on that, the candidate should identify this\nas a profitability problem, and ask to see historical revenue and cost information. Wanting to see\nthis information over time, rather than just for the most recent fiscal year, is important, indicating\nthe candidate’s understanding of the need to see trends rather than just a snapshot at this moment\nin time. The first chart provides this profitability information. The correct interpretation is that\nboth costs and revenues have risen over time, but that profits peaked in 2000 and have fallen ever\nsince.\nCharts 2 and 3 should be given in tandem. Chart 2 uses the famed “marimekko” format.\nCandidates should take some time to familiarize themselves with this chart. Bain loves these\ncharts. Marakon uses a similar data format in some of its studies. The interviewer should then\npresent chart 3 and ask the candidate which product on the chart is which. This will require the\ncandidate to identify the meaning of the two axes and the bubble size. The x axis is absolute\nmarket share (AMS), which is Syzygy’s revenues divided by the total revenues in the category.\nAMS is best estimated by the height of Syzygy’s rectangle in each of the five product areas. The\ny axis represents relative market share (RMS), which is calculated as Syzygy’s market share\ndivided by the market share of the next closest competitor, if Syzygy is the market leader in that\ncategory, in which case the RMS number will be greater than one. If Syzygy is not the market\nleader, then the calculation is Syzygy’s market share divided by the market share of the leader, in\nwhich case the RMS number will be less than one. Estimating RMS from the information on\n\nchart 2 is best done by looking at the ratio of the height of Syzygy’s rectangle in each of the five\nproduct areas to the height of competitors’ rectangles in each of those areas. Finally, the diameter\nof the bubbles is driven by Syzygy’s total revenues in that category, estimated from the\nmarimekko chart by the height of Syzygy’s rectangle (its market share) multiplied by the width\nof the rectangle (the size of the market). Correctly interpreting these two charts will lead the\ncandidate to correctly identify the products:\n- Product #1 is custom applications;\n- Product #2 is supercomputers;\n- Product #3 is telecommunications equipment;\n- Product #4 is satellites; and,\n- Product #5 is operating software.\nSo, now – how do you interpret the graphs and what to do about them? Looking at chart 3, the\nbubble in the upper-left hand corner of an AMS vs. RMS slide (product #1, in this case) indicates\na position as the market leader in a very fragmented industry. The obvious question, then, is what\nif any advantages accrue to such a leader. In this case, it is probably true that there are little if\nany economies of scale in custom applications, so increasing either AMS or RMS seems unlikely\nto lead to a competitive advantage. By contrast, the bubbles to the right hand side of a chart like\nthis (product #2, in this case) indicate a duopoly market in which the client company is in either\nfirst place or a close second. Finally, the bubble in the lower left-hand corner of such a chart\n(product #5, in this case) indicates a weak position and begs the question – are there economies\nof scale, network effects, and/or an experience curve at work here? Since this product is\noperating software, the answer is probably going to be “yes” in all three cases. The likely\nconclusion is that Syzygy’s already small market share in operating software will continue to\nerode. Translation: Syzygy should probably exit this business.\nCharts 4 and 5 conclude the case by looking at Syzygy’s research and development (R&D)\nspending. The key insight in chart 4 is that Syzygy is the only major competitor in this industry\nwhose R&D spending is below the “normative band” (the band indicated by the area in between\nthe two parallel lines). We would expect each company’s degree of technical leadership to go up\nas it invests in R&D. But Syzygy, with slightly more R&D than Cray Research, enjoys less of a\nperception of technical leadership from its customers, and is also dominated by Sonic Wave,\nwhich has a position to the north and west of Syzygy as well.\nChart 5 builds on this point by examining Syzygy’s R&D expenses as compared to its product\nprices over time. Although R&D as a % of the product price is clearly increasing over time, the\nkey insight here is the absolute expenses, not the % taken up by expenses. Spending $4\nmillion/unit on R&D for features that will allow a company to charge $6 million/unit more for its\nproduct is a good strategic move, even if it raises the overall % of a product’s sale price that is\nspent on R&D. However, Syzygy is spending more money on features than the customer’s\ncorresponding “willingness to pay” – for instance, from 2001 to 2003, Syzygy’s R&D spending\nper unit increased by $1.4 million, but the corresponding price increase was only $300,000/unit.\nLikely translation – Syzygy is spending money to develop features that consumers are not\nwilling to pay for. That’s a bad business practice.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a complex case with multiple possible interpretations. In light of the\ninformation presented, the candidate should be able to produce the most important insight, which\nis that Syzygy should either\n- cut R&D to eliminate spending on unnecessary customer features, or\n- keep R&D spending the same, but switch the work to developing features that consumers will\nbe willing to pay for at a level that is higher than the R&D expense itself.\nSyzygy’s position as the overall market leader would argue for Option B, but either option could\nbe argued for successfully. A second-order insight from the case is that Syzygy should exit the\noperating software business, since economies of scale, network economics, and the experience\ncurve are all working against it. By the same token, it should increase its focus in some of the\ncategories where it is the market leader, to get some or all of those economies to work for it and\nagainst its competition.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Rotisserie Ranch": "Rotisserie Ranch\nThis case is going to take a slightly different path from some of the others that you’ve probably\npracticed. We’re going to work through a business issue together – I’m going to ask you\nquestions to guide you in your analysis, and I’m going to look to you to come to a conclusion on\nhow to solve our client’s problem. If you’re ready, I’m going to read you a short description of\nthe situation and then begin asking you questions. Ready?\nOur client is Rotisserie Ranch, a poultry farming collaborative that specializes in growing\nchickens for rotisserie roasting. Its main line customer segment is comprised of large grocery\nchains, who buy its chickens to fresh roast in the meat departments of their retail stores.\nRotisserie Ranch is the market leader in rotisserie-ready chicken production. It grows its\nchickens to a specific size, weight, fat content and muscle tone so that they will remain juicy on\nthe spit (or under the heat lamp) while waiting to be taken home by a customer. It has developed\na differentiated process for sterilely packaging the chickens (after they have been plucked), so\nthat they will remain fresh for an extended period of time under refrigeration, rather than\nfreezing. This is a benefit to grocers, because predicting demand for cooked chickens is hard, and\nif the meat department staff has under-provisioned, a Rotisserie Ranch chicken can go from\nrefrigerator to roaster faster directly, bypassing the costly delay of thawing a frozen bird.\nMarket research has revealed to Rotisserie Ranch that more and more consumers have begun\nbuying flavored rotisserie chickens recently. Rotisserie chicken flavoring started when some\ngrocers began drenching chickens in barbecue sauce prior to roasting, but has branched out into\nother flavors like lemon herb, tandoori and teriyaki. Rotisserie Ranch is thinking of pre-spicing\nsome of its chickens for grocers. It has engaged us to determine whether or not this is a good idea.\nQuestion #1\nHow would you go about analyzing this issue?\nThe candidate should now lay out a clear structure for analyzing the case. This structure should\ninclude a proposal to analyze:\n- Revenue and Cost implications of new venture\n- How this will affect existing sales (expand the market?)\n- How this will affect cost structure (increased raw materials & labor? Same\ndistribution channel?)\n- Value to customers (grocery chains)\n- Competition\n- What competitors exist?\n- Do they have similar offerings?\n- How they might respond?\nQuestion #2\nYour team begins analyzing this issue by interviewing grocery retailers. Do you think that\ngrocery retailers would be interested in pre-seasoned chickens from Rotisserie Ranch?\n\nIt is more important that the candidate’s answer this question be well thought-through than a\nspecific “yes or no” answer per se. The response should be grounded in solid business thinking,\nand not on personal experience or gut instinct.\nA “yes” response would include justifications like the following:\n- Pre-seasoned chickens would cut the grocer's labor costs (meat department workers don't need\nto spend time seasoning the chickens). There will be significant economies of scale in\nseasoning centralization;\n- Quality of seasoning on pre-seasoned chickens will be more consistent (it will be done\ncentrally and optimized by Rotisserie Ranch, rather than by a multitude of meat department\nworkers in hundreds of stores); or,\n- Rotisserie Ranch, being a chicken specialist, will be able to expend more resources to\nresearch the ideal seasoning blends – making its seasoned chickens more appealing than a\ngrocer’s homemade seasoned chickens.\nA “no” response would include justifications like the following:\n- Grocery chains differentiate from one another based on value-added departments, like meat. If\nRotisserie Ranch offers chickens with the same seasoning blend to competing chains, it will\neliminate one point of competitive distinctiveness;\n- The meat departments of specific grocery stores are likely to be better attuned to local\nconsumer tastes than a centralized seasoner like Rotisserie Ranch;\n- Adding different flavors of chicken will increase the total volume of chickens that a grocer\nneeds to keep in stock at any one time. Delaying “specialization” allows the grocer to tailor\nflavoring based on specific customer demand.\nQuestion #3\nIt turns out that the grocers are very interested in Rotisserie Ranch’s proposal. Superstore grocers,\nin particular, are interested in increasing variety while cutting staff labor. Your team uncovers\nthat many grocers have found seasoned chicken sales to be very inconsistent across their retail\nnetwork. They attribute this to low seasoning skills by their meat department workers. In the\ncourse of your interviews, they reveal to you that they will be happy to switch to Rotisserie\nRanch’s pre-seasoned chickens, but first they want to be sure that the Rotisserie Ranch chickens\nwill sell well. How would you test this?\nThe correct answer is to run a test market. The candidate may begin going into detail on how this\ntest would be run. Cut him or her off as soon as you are comfortable that they understand that:\n- A pilot test should be run; and,\n- The pilot needs to have some control or comparison group\nQuestion #4\nGood. We ran a test market on Rotisserie Ranch's barbecue chicken at two price points: $3 and\n$5. We found that, on average, a large grocery store will sell 1,000 chickens a week at the $3\nprice point and 300 barbecue chickens a week at the $5 price point. How would you use this\ninformation to help sell Rotisserie Ranch’s barbecue chicken to a grocery chain?\n\nThe candidate should now ask how much an average grocery store sells of its own barbecue\nchicken a week.\nIf the candidate asks this immediately say: “Good question” …and proceed to (A)\nThe interview cannot really continue until the candidate recognizes that he or she is missing this\npiece of information.If the candidate misses this, give him or her some time to get it, then ask:\n“What other information would be valuable to know before making your pitch”. If they get it,\nproceed to(A). If they don’t get it say: “OK, one thing that was helpful to us was that:”\n(A): A large grocery store generally grosses $2,000 a week on barbecue chickens, and sells 500\nof them.\nGiven this information, can you calculate whether the Rotisserie Ranch chickens are likely to sell\nbetter than the grocery store-prepared chickens?\nThe candidate should be able to quickly back out that the average price point of grocery store\nchickens is $4 ($2,000 divided by 500 chickens).\nThe candidate should assume that the demand function for Rotisserie Ranch chickens is linear. If\nthis is the case, a $4 price for a Rotisserie Ranch Chicken should result in sales of 650 chickens\n(the average of 1,000 chickens at the $3 price point and 300 chickens at the $5 price point). If the\ngrocery chain can sell more pre-seasoned chickens at the same price, it will be interested in\ncarrying the new Rotisserie Ranch product line.\nChicken Price Quantity Sold\n$3.00 1,000\n$5.00 300\n($3.00+$5.00)/2 = $4.00 (1,000+300)/2 = 650\nIf the candidate correctly calculates 650 chickens, at a $4.00 price, then say: Good. So, what\nwould be the incremental revenues that a grocery store would make each week by selling\nRotisserie Ranch chickens, rather than their own, assuming a $4.00 price?\nChicken Price Expected Quantity Sold Revenues\nRotisserie Ranch: $4.00 x 650 = $2,600\nMeat Department: $4.00 x 500 = $2,000\nIncremental Revenues = $600\n\nQuestion #5\nFrank Fieldsmith, Rotisserie Ranch’s VP of Marketing, is excited about the prospect of selling\npre-seasoned chickens. He thinks that this presents a branding opportunity for Rotisserie Ranch\nwith consumers. Would you advise Rotisserie Ranch to start a direct-to consumer (DTC)\ncampaign with its pre-seasoned chickens? Why or why not?\nYes, Rotisserie Ranch should start a DTC campaign on its chickens. This will give it:\n- Better defense against \"me too\" competitors\n- More power in negotiations with retailers over price and placement\n- Increased ability to get distribution into retail chains that currently don't carry its product line\n- The ability to do more effective consumer research about their opinions of its chicken\n- The potential to expand the category, drawing consumer attention to the benefits of pre-\nseasoned rotisserie chickens\n- etcetera\nA \"no\" answer is also acceptable, but only if very well justified.\nIn either case, the candidate should provide a clear structure to how he or she answers this\nquestion. Similar to the outset of the case, the best candidates will define a methodology for\nassessing this question. Allow the candidate to explore each of the avenues that (s)he defines by\nexplaining the circumstances under which branding would or would not be a good idea. Once the\ncandidate begins to coalesce on an opinion, you can move on.\nQuestion #6\nSuddenly, your manager bursts into the team room. “The chairman or Rotisserie Ranch’s board\njust called,” she says. “He’s skeptical about whether he should agree to continue funding this\npre-seasoning research,” she adds. How would you respond to the chairman? Should Rotisserie\nRanch continue to pursue this pre-seasoned chicken venture?\nThis is the classic “elevator pitch” moment. The candidate should provide a clear\nrecommendation to the chairman. This recommendation should not recapitulate the analysis\nperformed, but should draw upon that analysis to provide a succinct opinion.\nIn sum, this case requires some clear-headed intuition and logic around the process of new\nproduct introduction. Applying a structure that is rigorous but not completely rigid is the key to\nsolving this case.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Tarrant Fixtures": "Tarrant Fixtures\nYour client, Tarrant Fixtures, is a low-intensity manufacturing company that produces display\nfixtures for retail clients. It has been determined that the company’s financial performance has\ndeteriorated in each of the last three years. Management is specifically concerned with the\ncompany’s falling Return on Investment (“ROI”). You have been asked to diagnose the root\ncause(s) of this problem and recommend one or more solutions to put the company back on track.\nInformation to be Given by Interviewer (as the candidate asks for it)\n- The company has two types of products, each of which account for approximately 50% of\nrevenues:\n- \"custom displays\" (which are customized in design and manufacturing)\n- \"standard displays\" (which are manufactured according to standard blueprints)\n- During the last three years:\n- Total Revenues have grown by 25% [$100M to $125M];\n- Costs of production (materials, labor, SG&A, etc.) have remained stable as a\npercentage of revenue [80%];\n- The company has made no new investments in property, plant, and equipment\n(PP&E);\n- Standardized product information:\n- Total number of \"standardized\" products has increased from 5 to 12;\n- 5 standardized products account for 80 percent of sales in standardized products;\n- Inventory levels have increased by 300% during last three years (primarily in finished goods),\nfrom $25 million to $75 million;\n- Built-to-stock from sales forecast; and,\n- Total Capital Employed today-3yrs = $80M; Total Capital Employed today = $130M\nSolution\nThe critical insight of this case involves the division of ROI into its component pieces - profits\nand “investment.” This case can be quite challenging to the interviewee who focuses solely on\nthe company’s recent profits, which have grown substantially over the relevant time frame. A\ngood first step to “cracking” this case is to establish the parameters of the analysis using the ROI\nmetric given.\nMost candidates will begin by examining the profit element of ROI. It should become quickly\napparent, however that the company’s absolute level of profits have increased substantially\nduring the last three years (Profittoday = $25M; Profit today-3 = $20M). So this road is a dead\nend.\nA successful candidate should examine what level of investment was required to support the\nobserved increase in profits. A line-by-by line examination of a typical balance sheet will\nindicate all of the relevant categories of capital for purposes of calculating ROI. The following\nconclusions may then be drawn:\n- No increase in A/R minus A/P;\n\n- No increase in net PPE (in fact, most assets are fully depreciated);\n- No increase in cash balances; and,\n- Significant increase in inventory.\nDetermining that inventory build-up has negatively impacted ROI is the first-order insight\nrequired by this case. Second-order insights will correctly identify the reasons behind this\nbuildup:\n- proliferation of “standardized” product lines;\n- inaccurate demand forecasts resulting in excess safety stock;\n- obsolete inventories of “out-dated” product lines.\nBased upon the three factors identified above, management could consider a number of process\nimprovements. A successful candidate should identify one of more of these improvements and\nshould be prepared to discuss potential pitfalls that might be encountered when implementing\nthem:\n- Write-off or work-down \"obsolete\" inventory (this will cause an immediate \"hit\" on profits,\nso management may be reluctant);\n- Improve demand forecasting to set more realistic safety stock levels (how can the company\nimprove demand forecasting?); and/or,\n- Regulate product-line proliferation to avoid future occurrences of problem (how?).\nConclusion\nThis is a short case, designed to be solved in approximately 15-20 minutes. The important steps\nare 1) establishing a viable structure, 2) breaking down the problem into its component parts, and\n3) continuing to examine issues until the correct ones are identified.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Vindaloo Corporation": "Vindaloo Corporation\nOur client, Vindaloo Corporation, is a small biotechnology company that has developed a new\nseed for sugar beets, which produces twice as much sugar as the seeds that are currently in use.\nThey now want to sell the company, and wonder how much it is worth.\nIn addition, the following information applies (give this to the candidate, only if he or she asks\nfor it):\n- Beets grown from the new seeds will produce sugar in a 1:2 ratio rather than the 1:1 ratio that\nis now prevalent. In other words, now 100 beets produce 100 pounds of sugar, an average of\none pound per beet. 100 beets grown from the new seeds will now produce 200 pounds of\nsugar, or an average of two pounds per beet.\n- Sugar is a mature commodity. The wholesale market is $2 billion worldwide per year.\n- The elasticity of demand for sugar is 1.\n- The value chain can be broken down into four primary processes:\n- farming (planting, harvesting, and selling beets), which takes 40% of the cost;\n- trucking, which takes 10% of the cost;\n- refining, which takes 30% of the cost; and\n- distribution, which takes 20% of the cost.\n- Farmland that is not used for sugar can be repurposed to grow cabbage, which is currently one\nfifth as profitable as sugar.\n- Trucking costs for sugar are 5% fixed and 95% variable, with the variable costs directly\nrelated to the weight of what is being trucked.\n- Refining costs are all variable, and it will cost 25% more per beet to refine the new beets than\nit cost to refine the old beets.\n- There are no cost savings in distribution from the reduced volume.\n- The worldwide sugar market is predicted to grow at 100% annually.\n- We can assume a 100% market penetration, since there are no competing products, and the\nefficacy of the product is proven.\nSolution\nThis product will only allow our client’s clients (sugar growers) to produce sugar more\nefficiently. It won’t cause the sugar to taste any better or cause consumers to demand more of it.\nTherefore the product cannot be expected to grow revenue, but it will reduce costs. The value of\nVindaloo Corporation is directly related to how much cost saving its product effects – this is\nsimilar conceptually to the Maine Apples case.\nTo solve for the cost savings, we should look at each component step of the overall value chain\nin turn:\n- Farming – The product allows farmers to grow the same amount of sugar on half of the land.\nCandidates who think that farmers will just use the same amount of land and produce twice as\nmuch sugar have not thought the question through. If everyone in the world produced twice as\nmuch sugar as they were producing before, there would be far more supply than demand. So\nwe can assume that farmers will keep half of their land for sugar and repurpose the rest of the\nland for growing cabbage. Previously, one acre of land produced “X” profits of sugar – now\nhalf an acre can produce profits of “X” while the other half produces profits of “.1X” of\n\nprofits from cabbage. Recall that cabbage is a fifth as profitable as sugar currently – this\nmeans that it will be only a tenth as profitable as the “new” sugar. Since profits per acre go\nfrom X to 1.1X, there is a 10% increase in profits from farming.\n- Trucking - variable trucking costs, which represent 95% of the total cost structure, will\ndecrease by 50%, leading to an overall costs savings of 95% x 50% = 47.5%.\n- Refining – refining costs drop by half because only half as many sugar beets are being refined.\nHowever, then there is a 25% increase in costs per beet. So the costs go from “X” to “.5X” to\n“.625X”, an overall savings of 37.5%.\n- Distribution - there are no cost savings in distribution.\nNow the candidate needs to weight the cost savings by the amount of costs that each step adds to\nthe value chain, as follows:\nStep A Cost Portion B Cost Savings Weighted Cost Savings(A x B)\nFarming 40% 10% 4%\nTrucking 10% 47.5% 4.75%\nRefining 30% 37.5% 11.25%\nDistribution 20% 0% 0%\nTotal 100% 20%\nSo, our client’s product will save 20% a year in sugar costs – multiplied by $2 billion, that cost\nsavings comes out to $400 million per year. The final question then, is how valuable is that?\nHere, it would be valuable for the candidate to know the perpetuity formula, which is:\nWe are given the growth rate, g, as 2%. “r” is not given, but we can go with the standard\nassumption of 10%. Therefore the company can be valued at:\nConclusion\nThis is a valuation case and, as such, has a lot of number crunching. But there are also several\nimportant qualitative insights for the candidate to make, the main one of which is that the new\ntechnology will halve the land rather than doubling production, which would cause an immediate\nworldwide sugar glut and rapidly falling prices.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Prozac (A.T.Kearney)": "Prozac (A.T.Kearney)\nFluoxetine hydrochloride – commonly known as Prozac – is the world's most widely prescribed\nantidepressant, with sales that totaled $2.8 billion in 1998. Produced by Eli Lilly & Company,\nProzac has already been in the market for several years, presenting very impressive growth rates\n(only between 1997 and 1998, the product accounted for 20% of the company’s growth). Prozac\nis a prescription-only, very high margin product, one that represents approximately 40% of Eli\nLilly’s earnings.\nHowever, in the last years, Prozac has been facing stagnant and even declining sales in some\nperiods. Eli Lilly’s management team is not quite sure why this has happened to one of their\nmost important brands. It is now your job to try to figure out why Prozac’s sales are\nflat/declining.\nIn order to help you do that, the extremely busy Eli Lilly CEO, Sidney Taurel, will meet you in a\nVIP lounge at Indianapolis International Airport, between his arrival and his next connection. He\nwill only have 15 minutes, in which time you will be allowed to ask no more than 5 questions.\nRight after that, you’ll have to call your manager at A. T. Kearney’s Chicago office and give him\nyour assessment of the situation and a set of potential solutions, so the team can start to work in\norder to meet the very tight deadline imposed by the client.\nWhat might be causing Prozac’s stagnant sales and which are the possible solutions?\nNote from Author: I was only allowed to ask 5 questions. That was a new situation for me, as far\nas case interviews were concerned, so I had to both manage the stress and think carefully on my\nstrategy to get the most out of each question. In a situation like that, there’s not one single\nframework that would help you ace the case. I decided to write this case on a dialog format,\nbased on the notes I took during the interview. I also took the initiative to add some more\ninformation, in order to make the write up more complete.\nInterview Dialogue\nMyself (paraphrasing the interviewer): Prozac is an antidepressant that is only sold under\nprescription. It has been the first drug in this market and has rapidly grown due to its\neffectiveness in the treatment of depression. Is that correct?\nInterviewer: Yes, it’s correct…\nMyself (smiling): Did that count as one of my five questions? Ops! I’ve just missed my second\none…\nInterviewer (smiling): Don’t worry, go ahead…\nMyself: So, if this was the case, I would imagine that some competitors tried to follow Prozac\nand develop similar formulas over the years in order to gain a stake of this profitable market. The\n\nproduct’s impressive record of success may have attracted not only generics but also brand name\ncompetitors.\nInterviewer: Yes, the company saw the entrance of new products in the antidepressant market…\nMyself: So, I will make this one my first question: do any of the competitors exhibit any\ndistinctive feature and/or characteristic (such as higher effectiveness, fewer side effects or lower\nprices) that would pose a major threat to Prozac? If yes, it would be great if you could describe\nthose specific features and/or characteristics. Question count\n= 1.\nInterviewer: Sure. But before that, let me give you a brief perspective on how the market for\nantidepressants has developed… Before Prozac was launched, the most commonly used type of\nantidepressant was called “tryciclics”. Those drugs were carefully controlled and largely\nprescribed by psychiatrists only, due to their serious and sometimes fatal side effects. The\ninnovation Prozac brought to the category was a reduction on the side effects, which prevents\nusers from committing suicide by ingesting large doses of medication. As a result, the number of\npatients treated for depression grew five to seven times from what it used to be. Now, you’re\nright: Prozac has been a favorite target for both generics and other brand name drugs (such as\nZoloft, from Pfizer, and Paxil, from GlaxoSmithkline). Generics basically compete on price (30-\n40% lower). Moreover, Prozac has been particularly suffering attacks from other patent-\nprotected antidepressants in the same category, the Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors\n(SSRI). Those products, among other indications, have been specifically prescribed for General\nAnxiety Disorders (GAD).\nMyself: As you described, it seems to me this is a very mature category and I wouldn’t expect\nmuch of the growth opportunity coming from category expansion…\nInterviewer: Right. If you were in another product category, it could be the case. However,\nmanifestation of psychotic disturbs are so apparent that we can assume there are very few\nuntreated patients.\nMyself: Right… If other products within the same category are growing, while Prozac’s sales\nhave been stagnant or declining, the company must have experienced a decline in market share.\nWas that loss observed more notably in one particular segment of the market as opposed to the\nothers? Question count = 2.\nInterviewer: Yes. Prozac’s market share is decelerating pretty significantly in the psychiatrists’\noffices. So far, prescriptions by primary care practitioners are holding up better, but they tend to\nfollow specialists’ lead.\nMyself: I see… Apart of the generics, do prices vary significantly among branded drugs?\nQuestion count = 3.\n\nInterviewer: No. All of them are at about the same price range. Price only varies significantly\nbetween brand name products and generics. As I mentioned before, generics tend to be 30%-40%\ncheaper in average.\nMyself: And when does the Prozac patent expire? Question count = 4.\nInterviewer: The basic patent expires in 2001, and subsidiary patents in 2003… I believe should\nremind you that you only have one question left.\nMyself: Yes, thank you. Is there any other information, an important external factor, for example,\nthat I should be aware of before developing my final recommendations? Question count = 5.\nInterviewer: Yes, and I’m really glad you asked me that. In recent years, Prozac has deserved\nmore attention from the general media than we probably would like to. It all started at about 10\nyears ago. Around 8:30 a.m. on September 14th, 1989, Joseph Wesbecker walked into the\nStandard Gravure printing plant in Louisville carrying an AK-47 assault rifle and hundreds of\nrounds of ammunition. Within 30 minutes, he killed eight people and wounded 12 others before\npulling a pistol from his belt and shooting himself in the head. He had worked for the company\nfor many years, but had found it so stressful that he had been off sick for a year. He was under\ntreatment from a psychiatrist, and shortly before the fatal incident he had been prescribed Prozac.\nWithout Prozac, the killings would have been just another horrifying instance of the senseless\nmass killings that seem to plague modern life. With Prozac, they became a famous cause. By\n1990, 54 civil and criminal suits concerning Prozac had been filed against Eli Lilly, including\none by the survivors of Wesbecker's killing spree and the families of the dead. The victims\nclaimed that a reaction to Prozac, not Wesbecker's inherent mental illness, had caused the act and\nthat Eli Lilly had consistently misrepresented Prozac's safety to the Food and Drug\nAdministration and the medical community. Until today, Prozac has been frontally attacked on\nthe general media, which has generated disbelief from the general public.\nMyself: Ummm… pretty interesting story. Well, I know your time is scarce, so I would like to\nsummarize my general assessment of the situation and briefly share with you a set of potential\nrecommendations that I will be forwarding to our project team in Chicago. Is that okay with you?\nInterviewer: Yes, please, go ahead…\nMyself: Prozac has been extremely successful since its launch, rapidly achieving market\nleadership and still producing high margins. Despite all the difficulties and the tough competitive\nenvironment, Prozac is still a very important product on Eli Lilly’s portfolio, accounting for a\nsignificant portion of the company’s earnings. Various factors contribute to the current decrease\nin sales: a more fragmented and aggressive market, new improved products, and public\nmisjudgment. The development of a new drug could be costly and takes several years before it’s\nready to go to market. Moreover, the patent expires in a few years.\nInterviewer: Good…\n\nMyself: My very first impression is that Prozac fits very well the concept of a “cash-cow”: large\nmarket share and high margin, but stagnant/declining sales. But for the development of a first set\nof hypotheses, I would also consider other less probable possibilities. In order to save us some\ntime, I’ll list some of the possibilities I currently have in mind, and then we can go through each\none of them as time permits. Would that be fine?\nInterviewer: Yes, that sounds perfect to me…\nMyself: Right… Here they are (I took a clean white sheet and started to write in bullet points):\n- Do nothing\n- Extend Prozac’s life cycle\n- Product development\n- Product modifications (expand user base through OTC status)\n- Develop a new antidepressant\n- Develop a new drug in other segment\nOwn R&D capabilities/resources\n-\nLook for partnerships\n-\nMyself: As a “cash-cow”, Eli Lilly should consider “milk” this product, extracting earnings as\nlong as the product survives in the market. The first alternative to that would be to extend\nProzac’s life cycle as long as possible. That could be achieved, for example, by prolonging\nProzac’s patent protection.\nInterviewer: But how could that be achieved?\nMyself: Honestly, I’m not very familiar with the mechanisms through which a patent can be\nextended. Having said that, I would imagine there might be a legal mechanism to do that… And\nthis issue brings us to one of my other points. There have to be a way to prolong Prozac’s life\ncycle and/or expand its user base. Lobbying might be a valid option. Also, we could consider\nproduct modifications that would allow Prozac to be used for applications different of the ones it\nis currently prescribed.\nInterviewer: Right. I think that can be possible…\nMyself: … and if developing a new version of Prozac is possible, imagine if this modified drug\ncould be sold as an over-the-counter medicine! That would bring a huge market expansion\npotential for Eli Lilly.\nInterviewer: Wow! That would be huge!\nMyself: In the product development field, I would also explore two addition possibilities. First of\nall, I would assess Eli Lilly’s current R&D capabilities and resources, and evaluate whether the\ncompany is able to: 1) develop the modified version of Prozac we have just mentioned, and 2)\ndevelop a new drug, either in the antidepressant market or in any other promising segment.\nAlternatively, I would recommend Eli Lilly to do some industry research in order to identify\n\npotential partnerships. Do you want to get into the details of any of those (pointing to my\nbulleted list)?\nInterviewer: No, actually not. Unfortunately I do have to catch my plane and I do believe we\nhave a pretty good start for this project. Send my congratulations for you’re A.T Kearney project\nteam, you did a very good job.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Shamrock Chemical": "Shamrock Chemical\nAdvanced difficulty. The candidate will most likely need to be pushed in the right direction at\ntimes. Use a\nleading interview style. The case is designed to see if they can draw the appropriate insights and\nnot structure a\nsolution to a very broad problem.\nQuestion (posed by the interviewer):\nThe agri-chemical industry has been consolidating for some time, down from 20 to 10 worldwide\nmanufacturers in\njust 5 years. The market has been declining as genetically modified seed technology and superior\nfarming methods\nhave decreased the need for agri-chemicals.\nShamrock Chemical is a company based in Missouri with several factories across the United\nStates that produce both\npackaged (dry) and bulk (large quantities of liquid) chemicals used in agriculture production.\nShamrock Chemical has long been the beneficiary of its proprietary AIs (Active Ingredients) that\nhave enabled it to\ncharge prices well in excess of its costs. Shamrock has continually invested a large percentage of\nits sales in its\nresearch and development program. Nonetheless, many of its most profitable AIs are about to\ncome off patent and\nthe VP in charge of sales is concerned that Shamrock’s EBIT will soon take a nosedive. He\nwants to know your\nthoughts on how Shamrock could maintain its profitability over the next few years.\nInformation to be given if asked:\n- Agri-chemicals consist of herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides, which are chemicals,\ndesigned to kill weeds, insects, and fungus that destroy or damage crops.\n- The average gross margin on Shamrock’s products is approximately 60%. There is no\ncorrelation between type of chemicals and margins.\n- The incremental margin on products is even higher than gross margins. Generic competitors\nare in the market.\n- In fact, other branded competitors of Shamrock have seen share decreases by as much as 20%\nand price decreases by as much as 30% following patent expiration.\n- There appear to be no more break through AIs in development by any of the manufacturers in\nthe industry.\n- Shamrock is the result of a several mergers in the past 10 years and is very lean, having\nreduced nearly all its overcapacity in production. In addition, it calls on the same channel\nmembers with a sales force no larger than any of the legacy companies. Lastly, most of\nShamrock’s fixed assets are fully depreciated.\nSolution:\nBasic Model to push the candidate towards:\nPush the candidate towards a profitability model. But, like the facts above, de-emphasize the cost\nside. If the candidate continues down that rabbit hole, simply inform him/her that the sales force\n\nportion of the organization that he is consulting for is positive it can get no smaller and the\nefficiencies of factories and other overhead are beyond the scope.\nA good basic hypothesis at this point\nIn order to maintain Shamrock’s EBIT, it must maintain its revenues, a combination of volume\nand price), amidst future generic pressure.\nSo how do you achieve that?\nDistributors: The candidate may have lots of ideas on how to maintain earnings. For example,\nhe/she may explore the idea of advertising, adding services with the product, or aggressively\nattacking generics through capacity or price competition. These are all logical starting points, but\nyou should first drive them to understand the channel structure of the industry and the two\n“solutions” that derive from that structure.\nShow Exhibit 1\n- Exhibit 1 should prompt some questions/discussion.\n- Shamrock sells to distributors and distributors sell to dealers. However, Shamrock has\nsalespeople that call on both parts of the channel.\n- The exhibit clearly shows that a few distributors account for a large portion of Shamrock sales.\nThis could look like one of two quick wins for the candidate – forward integration or align\nwith the most profitable and influential distributors and insulate against generic competition.\n- A good response to forward integration is to ask the candidate why we can do a better job at\ndistribution than the distributors. Don’t spend much time on this but mention that distributor\nmargins are low (1-3%) and see if the candidate realizes that it is unlikely that Shamrock\ncould do better.\n- A good response to this is to ask them how they keep out generics with the distributors (by\nthem answering or you filling in the blanks it sets them up for success later.) The answer\nshould be around limiting the amount of generics a distributor purchases on your key\nchemicals as they come off patent. In that way, you limit the amount of generic penetration\nand minimize the effect of your EBIT (it would probably be unrealistic to believe you could\ncompletely stop the flow).\n- Move to dealers: Follow this up by asking the candidate how much distributors\ninfluence the dealer/retailers. By looking at exhibit 1, they should see that distributors\n\nonly own 28% of dealer/retailers. The independent dealers are in fact not influenced\nmuch by distributors.\n- This information should prompt the candidate to ask about dealer structure or how it\ncompares to the distributor break out on exhibit 1.\nShow Exhibit 2\n- Exhibit 2 basically has the same insights as the distributor portion of exhibit 1. A small\nnumber of distributors account for a disproportionate amount of Shamrock’s sales. In fact,\nmargins are also small at the dealer/retailer. This pressure, combined with a declining market,\nis causing increased consolidation at the dealer level.\n- Aligning with winning dealer/retailers is a key insight here and was alluded to earlier in the\ndistributor discussion. At this point, we have hit the 80/20 mark. Beyond this, first look for\nideas on how to align with winning dealers and prevent generic erosion of market share. Here\nare a few:\n- Pay them for performance and maintaining share of products as they come off patent.\n- Certain dealers are high service dealers, can generally charge a higher price, and are attracting\nmore and more end-users (farmers).\n- Pay dealers more for higher service and increasing your share of the business.\n- Increase sales force time spent with high service, winning dealers.\n- Collect CRM data to evaluate the profitability of each dealer.\n- End-User: Treat this as a creative section. Another area to explore is how Shamrock\ninteracts with the end-user. There is the possibility to generate increased brand loyalty\nwith farmers and pull the products through the channel. Areas that the candidate\ncould explore:\n- Providing some services to the grower / maybe tying them to products.\n- Increasing the percentage of sales directly to the grower. The largest growers may not want\nthe channel and be willing to split the transaction cost savings.\n- Partnering with down stream users of crops to preference Shamrock treated crops.\n- Find unmet needs of the grower and fulfill them.\n\nSolution:\n- Finish the interview by allowing the candidate to summarize and outline how Shamrock\nshould proceed to preserve its profitability:\n- Shamrock must align with winning dealers to preserve its profitability. It must reward these\ndealers for supporting our products and growing our business. Going forward, Shamrock\nshould also determine the viability of selling directly to farmers and providing them with\nservices that strengthen our products’ experience and provide differentiation from generics.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Distilled Spirits": "Distilled Spirits\nYou are consulting for a major United States producer of distilled spirits. Their primary products\nare a line of mid-priced vodkas and two brands of mid-range rum. Over the past few years, the\nbusiness has become less and less profitable. What are the possible causes?\nInformation to be given if asked:\n- Product\n- The split of product sold has consistently been 60% vodka / 40% run over the past\nfew years.\n- The selling prices of the two lines are essentially the same.\n- Overall sales are growing at about 3 to 5% per year, the same as the industry average\nfor these product lines.\n- Cost\n- Production Costs have remained constant\n- Advertising Costs have remained constant on average\n- Distribution Costs have increased significantly\n- Distribution\n- The products are sold throughout the country.\n- In 27 “open” states, alcohol is sold in privately managed supermarkets and liquor\nstores. In “open” states, shelf space is extremely expensive and trade promotions are\ncritical. Such stores are also becoming less and less willing to hold inventory, which\nis increasing distribution costs by requiring more frequent deliveries.\n- In the other 23 “closed” states, liquor is only sold through state regulated liquor stores.\nDistribution costs in these states is much lower, as there are far fewer outlets to\nservice and central warehouses for the state-run stores. Also, Advertising of alcohol is\nmuch more tightly regulated, and therefore, advertising spending is lower.\nSolution:\nA greater and greater share of the volume is being sold in the “open” states, with sales in these\nstates increasing at about 10% per year. Sales in the regulated states are actually decreasing.\nBecause the regulated states are less expensive to serve, and therefore, more profitable, the fact\nthat they represent a shrinking portion of the total has caused total profits to decline.",

What would you tell the CEO about how to increase profits in 3 months?\nInformation to be given if asked:\nProfits = Revenues – Cost. This means that profits can be increased by increasing revenues\nand/or decreasing cost.\nCosts: We have already established that the client is the lowest cost producer, hence the costs\ncannot be lowered any further.\nRevenues\n- Focus on increasing revenues. Revenues consist of Price x Quantity.\n- The firm is running at maximum capacity utilization. Hence quantity cannot be increased.\n- The only solution is to increase Price.\nNOTE: The interviewee should draw the supply curve\nSolution:\nCommodity Demand Supply Analysis\n- The demand is highly inelastic. The two ways to increase price are to increase demand or to\ndecrease supply.\n- Due to the commodity nature of the product, it is unlikely that the demand can be increased\nsufficiently in the short run (3 months). Hence focus on supply.\n- The client should decrease its capacity utilization, which will cause the industry demand\ncurve to shift towards the left. This will increase the market clearing price from P1 to P2.\n- The interviewee should point out the 2 boxes showing increase (due to increased price) and\ndecrease (due to decreased supply) in client profits. The increase in profits outweighs the\ndecrease here.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Snack Food Company": "Snack Food Company\nA large salted snack food company has steadily been losing market share over that past two years,\nfrom a high of 20% to the current level of 18%. Profits as a percent of sales, however, have been\ngrowing. What could be causing this?\nInformation to be given if asked:\n- Market\n- The size of the total salted snack food market has grown from $15 billion to $17\nbillion during these two years;\n(the interviewee’s conclusion should be that the client’s total dollar sales have\nactually grown, but not kept pace with the market.)\n- The largest competitors are two multinational consumer products companies that\nfeature complete lines of snack foods. Together, these two companies have 55% of\nthe market.\n- Product\n- The product line of the client has not changed over this period.\n- Costs\n- The costs for the client have changed over this period: (% of selling price)\nCurrent Two years ago\nRaw Ingredients: 28% 26%\nConversion costs: 24% 24%\nDistribution: 8% 9%\nMarketing: 16% 18%\nSales force: 7% 9%\nPre-tax profit: 17% 14%\n- The sales force was cut to reduce costs, though the same number of outlets are still\ncovered by this sales force.\n- The changes in the marketing budget come from reduced trade promotions.\n- Sales Force/Distribution\n- The products are mostly sold through large grocery store chains and convenience\nstores.\n- The sales force generally visits each customer at least once per quarter.\n- Promotions usually occur at the end of each quarter. Grocery stores and convenience\nstores require some type of promotion to grant valuable end of aisle displays or\nadvertising space.\n- Competitors’ sales forces are regarded as the best in the industry.\nSolution:\nThe data show that the greatest change is in the sales force numbers. It turns out that the\ncompany went on a cost-cutting spree over the past two years. The sales force was drastically cut\nand the commission scheme was reworked.\nThe marketing expenditure was also decreased. Most of the reduction came from trade\npromotions. The product is sold through the same channels as previously: large grocery chains\nand convenience stores. These channels are traditionally driven by periodic trade promotions.\n\nThe reduction in trade promotions brought about a loss of shelf space, which has directly led to\nthe decrease in market share. Also, the product line has not changed in the past two years in a\nproduct category where new products and line extensions are routine. In addition, the market has\nbeen growing, indicating a missed opportunity for new products in the market. Lastly, the\nincrease in profitability has resulted from the lower costs, but may not be sustainable.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Conglomerate ROIC Increase (McKinsey)": "Conglomerate ROIC Increase (McKinsey)\nYour client is a 5B dollar conglomerate with 50 plants nationwide. They were formed by\nacquisition of various small firms over the last 10 years and there are still some integration issues.\nThe CEO would like to increase the ROIC of the firm from 10% to 20% in 3 years. Is it possible\nand how would you achieve this?\nInformation to be given if asked:\nROIC Definition\n- ROIC is Return on Invested Capital. This can be achieved by growing the profits of the firm\nand/or by decreasing the invested capital.\n- There are firms in the industry that have 20-30% ROIC. Hence the client’s target looks\nachievable.\nCustomers\n- Client has 30% customers in Europe, 10% in Asia, 50% in North America and 10% in ROW.\n- The client has 2 types of products – Standard (almost a commodity) and Engineered (designed\nspecifically for the client).\n- The standard products are getting commoditized, hence have significant price pressure.\n- The engineered products have good margins in the 1st year and then the margins decrease in\nsubsequent 3-4 years.\n- The client has 30,000 SKUs in their product portfolio.\n- The industries that the client serves are as follows:\nIndustry % of Revenues Standard product Engineered product\nAutomotive 55% 65% 35%\nElectronics 25% 45% 55%\nConstruction 10% 75% 25%\nOthers 10% 70% 30%\n- NOTE: The interviewee should recognize the following by now based on the Customer\nInformation\n- Client % revenues from Electronics industry are quite low and that industry has the\nhighest % of Engineered products. The client should focus more closely on that\nindustry.\n- Engineered products offer much higher margins.\n- 30,000 SKU seem like a lot, and should address that in the case as well. There will be\ninterdependencies among these products.\nCompetitive Landscape\n- This is a highly fragmented industry with 20,000 competitors.\nInvestment/Cost\n- There are integration issues among the small companies under the client umbrella. The issues\npertain to decentralized sourcing, sales staff and back office operations. These should be\ncentralized to decrease cost (economies of scale) and improve coordination.\n- The product portfolio needs to be optimized. Evaluate profitability of each product along with\nits interdependency, i.e. its importance in a product portfolio supplied to important clients.\nEvaluate profitability of each client as well. Suggest using databases for this analysis.\n\n- Divest assets pertaining to certain non-profitable low volume standard products to decrease\ncapital investment.\n- If these components are still needed for a client portfolio investigate outsourcing their\nproduction and having exclusive contracts to maintain quality.\n- Evaluate the capacity utilization and supply chain for the 50 plants. Decrease investment if\npossible.\nSolution:\nThe client can increase the ROIC from 10% to 20% by the following initiatives:\n- Optimize product mix while keeping product interdependencies in mind\n- Sell more engineered products by growing business in electronics industry\n- Decrease cost by improving the internal integration",
  "Goizueta_2006_Agricultural Equipment Manufacturing": "Agricultural Equipment Manufacturing\nYour client is a large agricultural equipment manufacturer. Their primary product line, farming\ntractors, is losing money. What questions would you ask of your client to help them solve their\nprofitability problem?\nInformation to be given if asked:\nMarket\n- Your client has 40% of the market, competitor #1: 30%, competitor #2: 15%, with the\nremaining 15% belonging to many small manufacturers.\n- Five years ago, your client had 60% of the market, competitor #l, 15%, and competitor #2,\n10%. Obviously, your client has lost significant market share to its two competitors over the\nlast few years.\n- All three competitors sell to the same customers.\nProduct\n- Your client’s product is priced higher than competitors and has historically been the most\nexpensive.\n- Essentially the tractors have the same basic features. Of course, tractors are not commodity\nitems and a few differences do exist.\n- Your client has a strong reputation/image of quality in the market and the market has always\nbeen willing to pay a premium for that reputation because it meant they would last longer and\nneed less maintenance. This can be critical for some farmers because they cannot afford to\nhave a piece of equipment break down at a critical time.\n- Client has been involved in product improvement efforts-- tightened tolerances and improved\nthe durability of component parts.\n- They have needed to buy more expensive parts to execute this.\nMargins\n- Sales quantity and revenues are down.\n- However, price and costs are up. Fixed costs are constant while material costs have increased.\nThe client has no answer as to why material prices have gone up so staggeringly.\n- The operation is primarily an assembly operation and finished part prices have gone up.\n- Client does not think that raw material prices or labor costs for your suppliers have increased.\nSolution:\nIt turns out that prices have been raised to cover the costs of these improvements, but customers\ndo not value these improvements unless they are essentially free --so sales are down. The client\nneeds to incorporate a cost/benefit analysis procedure into its product improvement process.\nDon't forget though, that you must consider the long-term effects of these decisions.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Paint Manufacturer (McKinsey)": "Paint Manufacturer (McKinsey)\nYour client is the CEO of a paint manufacturing company. One McKinsey team has previously\nworked on optimizing their cost structure. The CEO wants to further improve their profitability.\nHow would you analyze the situation?\nInformation to be given if asked:\nIndustry Structure\n- The industry growth rate is same as GDP growth.\n- Client has 30% market share.\n- 2nd competitor has 35% market share. There are number of small regional and local paint\nmanufacturers as well which serve the rest of the market.\nCustomers\n- The customers are of 2 types: Professionals (contractors) and Private Consumers.\n- The customers are not very loyal (recognize this as an issue to be addressed later if time\npermits).\n- They have multiple brands and have good basic quality paint.\nFirm’s Economics\n- The total revenues are 1B.\n- There are 3 sales channels as follows:\n- Company owned stores: 600M in sales. Focuses on contractors (professionals).\n- Consumer division: 300M in sales. Sold through mass merchandises.\n- Independent dealers: 100M in sales. Sold to local mom & pop stores. The client\nmaintains a separate set of warehouses to serve this channel.\n- Make the candidate calculate the Profitability numbers as below:\nChannel Revenues Return on Sales Profits\nCompany owned stores 600M 5% 30M\nConsumer division 300M 3% 9M\nIndependent dealers 100M 1% 1M\n- The target for the firm is $80M.\nCompetition\n- The competitors also have 3 distribution channels. There is no data on competitor’s\nprofitability.\nSolution:\n- The candidate should recognize that company store channel, which focuses on contractors\n(professionals) have the highest ROS (return on sales). The company needs to focus on this\nsegment.\n- The independent dealer channel has the lowest ROS. The company needs to re-evaluate their\nstrategy/presence in that channel.\n- The client needs to focus on their sales force and strengthen their relationship with the\ncontractors. Since loyalty is an issue, introduce switching costs. Some techniques are order\nautomation by establishing web presence, which will allow the contractors to quickly and\neasily re-order.\n- Re-evaluate the sales force compensation and their commission structure.\n\nSuper Regional Bank\nYou have a have recently been assigned to a project with one of the nation’s super regional\nbanks. The bank is one of the top 10 largest retail banks in the country. Like most banks in its\nclass it has branches in 8 geographically contiguous states.\nYour client has recently concluded that the old “local branch” way of business is no longer\nviable. Typically, this bank has canvassed its territory with small freestanding branches; however,\nthe new age of electronic banking and commerce is changing all of that. They are considering\nreplacing many branches with Calling Centers. Calling Centers offer both live and phone\nautomated services that may be accessed by phone. The new Centers would offer virtually all of\nthe services currently offered through local branches plus some additional things.\nThe question to you is: how would you go about setting up the engagement to determine the\nviability of this new concept? Specifically, what kinds of things would you investigate? And\nwhat hypothesis would you form?\nSolution:\nSummary: It probably is best setup as a cost benefit analysis. The number of new customers\ntimes the expected revenue from them plus the additional revenue generated by potential new\nservices plus the cost savings must outweigh the forgone revenue generated by the customers\nyou end up driving away.\nThis is a very open broad-brushed case. There certainly is no right answer; however this type of\ncase occurs frequently. The following is a guideline of some things you should probably\nconsider:\nMarket analysis: What kinds of customers would be attracted to this no service? What kinds of\ncustomers would be turned off? (Hypothesis: younger people would be heavier users and more\nattracted than older) Of the people attracted to this new service, how profitable are they? How\nprofitable are the people who are turned off by this service? (Hypothesis: older people have more\nmoney and thus are more profitable)\nRevenue: What types of new services could be added to increase revenues? Automatic bill\npayment, Fund transfer, etc.\nCost Savings: How much would it cost to establish a Calling Center and what are the risks\ninvolved? Do we have the expertise in-house to do this? How many branches could we close?\nCan we cut down on traffic to existing branches - thus requiring fewer tellers?",
  "Goizueta_2006_Local Banking Demand": "Local Banking Demand\nHow would you determine whether a location in New York City holds enough banking demand\nto warrant opening a branch?\nSuggested framework:\nBecause this is a demand-oriented question, one should consider a marketing framework, such as\nthe 4 P’s.\nSolution:\nThe demographics of the area surrounding the prospective branch should be examined.\nPopulation, business concentration, income levels, etc. should be compared with those of\nhistorically successful branches.\nCompetitor reactions could easily make this venture unprofitable, so it is essential to anticipate\nthem. These will depend on the importance of the area to competitors (in terms of profit, share,\netc.)\nThe client will have to match competitors’ incentives to customers and should estimate the cost\nof doing so.\nThe client must examine if the new branch would complement their existing competence and\nstrategy (retail or commercial, high growth or high profitability, etc.) and what purpose it would\nserve. If the need focuses on deposits and withdrawals only, maybe a cash machine would\nsuffice.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Direct Mail Retailer": "Direct Mail Retailer\nYou are consulting for a direct mail retailer that sells ladies clothing. Your client’s catalog\nprinting and postage costs have just increased to thirty-two cents per catalog. How can your\nclient decide if the new price is acceptable?\nInformation to be given if asked:\n- The average response rate for catalogs mailed is 2%.\n- In addition, 25% of customers who order product can be expected to reorder within six\nmonths.\n- In other words, each 100 catalogs mailed results in 2.5 orders place.\n- The average order size is $80.\n- The fully allocated profit margin (excluding mailing costs) on catalog orders is 15%.\nSolution:\n- For each 100 catalogs mailed, printing and postage costs are $32. (100 x 32 cents).\n- Each 100 catalogs will result in 2 orders, plus 2 x 25%, or .5 additional reorders, for a total of\n2.5 orders placed per 100 catalogs mailed.\n- 2.5 orders will result in 2.5 x 80, or $200 in sales. At a profit margin of fifteen percent, these\nsales will return a total profit of $30.\n- The $30 profit is not sufficient to cover the printing and mailing costs of $32. Therefore, the\nclient should reject the printing arrangement at 32 cents per copy.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Selective Binding": "Selective Binding\nYour client is a major fashion magazine that has been offered by its printer a proprietary new\nprocess called selective binding which enables publishers to customize the pages included in\nreaders' magazines based on demographic data known about the reader. For example, an ad in\nBetter Homes & Gardens for lawn chemical services could be placed only in those issues going\nto subscribers who live in houses and not to those living in condominiums or apartments. In this\nway, advertisers can focus their communications on the demographic segment they are targeting.\nWould you advise your client to take advantage of this new process and offer selective binding to\nits advertisers?\nInformation to be given if asked:\nReaders\n- The magazine's database can make demographic breakdowns between subscribers who make\nunder $50,000 and those who make over $50,000.\n- There are l million readers, 80% of who are subscribers.\n- Twenty-five percent of subscribers make under $50×000, 75% make over $50,000. The same\nmix applies to the newsstand buyers according to readership audits.\nAdvertisers\n- Most advertisers are selling high-end fashion products, so 75% of them are targeting the high-\nincome group.\nCosts\n- The service is being offered to your client free for 3 years since the printer wants to promote\nthe service's use by getting a major magazine to start using it.\n- The client charges $50 per thousand per full-page ad (selective binding can only be offered on\nfull-page ads). Therefore revenue associated with a single inserted page (front and back) in an\nissue is $100 per thousand.\nCompetition\n- The client's closest direct competitor has 500,000 readers, 100% of whom are subscribers.\nEffectively, all of their readers make over $50,000. They charge $70 per thousand for their\nfull one-page ads.\nSolution:\nThe Magazine would want to consider offering the service to its advertisers if it would be able to\nenhance its earnings by being able to charge its advertisers a premium for being able to more\nexactly and efficiently target the demographic segment they want to reach. Of course the\nincreased revenue from the any premium must be able to offset any revenue lost as advertisers\nstopped targeting.\nCost/Benefit Analysis\nSince the printing cost to the client of selective binding is zero, the client simply needs to\nevaluate cost on the basis of revenue per thousand gained or lost as their advertiser base uses the\nservice to better target their ads to their desired segment. Presumably, instead of 100% of\nadvertisers paying the full $50/thousand per page, the 25% of advertisers targeting the lower\nincome segment will choose to advertise only to the 25% of subscribers targeting the high\nincome segment will choose to advertise only to the 25% of subscribers falling into that segment\nand the 75% of the advertisers targeting the high income segment will advertise only to the high\n\nincome subscribers (75% of subscribers). Assume that all advertisers continue to advertise in\n100% of the newsstand copies. The revenue effect of this change can be calculated by looking at\nthe impact the change would have on average ad rate per thousand on subscription readership:\nNew ad revenue per page = Old ad revenue per page X [(% low income subscribers X % low\nincome target advertisers) + (96 high income subscribers X % high Income advertisers)]\nThus, new ad revenue per page = $50 X [(25% X 25%) + (75% X 75%)] at old rate $31.25 < $50\nNow the question is, can ad rates per thousand on the selective binding portion of ads sold be\nincreased sufficiently to increase average revenue per thousand over what it is today? To answer\nthis question, your client's ad rates must be looked at from the perspective of their advertisers. If\nyou consider the advertisers targeting the high-income group, their alternative to advertising in\nyour client's magazine is to put their ad dollars toward the 100% high-income readership\ncompetitor. The cost per thousand high-income readers with the competitor magazine is:\n(Page rate X total readership)/ (portion of readers who are high income) = ($70 X\n500,000)/500,000 = $70\nThus $70 is the maximum price per thousand the client can charge its advertisers for selectively\nbound ads before the advertisers would switch to their competitor. Note that currently, the client\nis a cheaper buy for these high-income advertisers even though they are paying to reach readers\nthey do not want:\n($50 X 1 million)/750,000 = $66.67\nIf the client charged $70/thousand for selectively bound ads, average revenue per thousand to the\nclient would be:\n$70 X [(255 X 25%) + (75% X 75%)) = $43.75\nSolution\n- Since $43.75 is less than the $50 that advertisers are currently paying, the magazine should\nnot offer advertisers the selective binding service.\nOf course, there are other issues which interviewees might want to mention such as the\npossibility of price discriminating between high and low income advertisers, the potential for and\ncost of expanding the advertising base using selective binding as a selling tool, etc. However, it\nis important by the end of the interview to have reached a recommendation regarding the initial\nquestion posed by the interviewer. To mention these other possibilities and areas for further\ninvestigation is certainly worthwhile, but it is also important not to get too far off track or to\ncomplicate the issue so much that a final recommendation is never reached.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Pipeline Company": "Pipeline Company\nYou are hired by a large pipeline company to evaluate the current and future potential of the\npipeline industry. The pipeline industry sprang up as transportation costs for mineral extraction\ncompanies began to escalate. There is currently 20,000 miles of pipeline throughout the U.S.\nWhat information would you want to know about the pipeline industry that could help you plot a\nstrategy for a pipeline company?\nInformation to be given if asked:\nIndustry Structure\n- Pipeline can be characterized as either common carrier pipelines (~70% of all pipeline miles)\nwhich are regulated by the government and proprietary pipelines (~30% of all pipeline miles)\nwhich are wholly located on the private property of a firm (e.g. a pipeline from a port station\nto a near-shore refinery).\n- There are many suppliers of common carrier pipelines.\n- The second group (proprietary) is not regulated by the government.\nProducts\n- The pipelines carry liquid and gaseous materials -- crude oil, natural gas, methane gas, liquid\nnitrogen, refined oil products (gasoline), and chemicals.\nCost\n- There are exceptionally high fixed costs involved in a pipeline.\n- The variable costs are primarily the electricity to power pumping stations along the pipeline.\nThere are different cost structures depending on the type of product being moved. Pumping\ncrude oil along the pipeline can cost as much as $2M/month in electricity for a station.\nGaseous products require considerably less energy to move.\nMarket Conditions\n- U.S. proven reserves are diminishing and foreign imports are increasing. It is expected that for\nthe next 5-10 years demand will be steady.\nSolution\n(classic Porter analysis could be used -- This is rarely the case!!!)\n- Threat of Entry is low because ...\n- there are high fixed costs (high initial investment)\n- pipeline services are essentially a commodity product (commodity markets are slow\ngrowth and unattractive)\n- Industry Rivalry is strong because ...\n- there are many competitors and switching costs are low\n- industry growth is expected to be slow (i.e. market share is important)\n- many competitors use pipeline for in-house uses and only carry other products if\ncapacity is underutilized\n- there are very high exit barriers (i.e. there is a strategic relationship between refining\nand piping)\n- Substitute Products are many...\n- by proliferation of tanker cars and tractor trailer rigs for liquid and gaseous materials\n- Power of Suppliers is not a significant factor.\n\n- Power of Buyers is not a significant factor because many pipelines are regulated and there are\nmany buyers\n- Other considerations:\n- Product Mix: The margins on gaseous products is higher than heavy unrefined\nproducts.\n- Government Regulation: Margins are greatly affected by common carrier status. Any\nfuture environmental regulations will cut even deeper into margins.\n- Pipeline as a storage medium: For many firms the product in a pipeline can be a\nsignificant portion of its inventory and the volume in line must be considered in\nproduction. The classic question: Is it better to make product and sell it now at low\nprices or wait for prices to increase (e.g. crude oil prices)? A large pipeline could be a\ntemporary storage facility.\n- Operations: Maximizing profit means understanding the parameters of pumping --\ncosts of pumping at less than full capacity; layout of pipeline and pumping stations;\nproducts which can share the same pipeline; construction of parallel pipelines.\nMarket Differences: The market for crude oil is very different than the market for specialty\nchemicals or natural gas. The pipeline manager must aware of these rapidly changing commodity\nmarkets to maximize his profit.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Aluminum Can Manufacturer": "Aluminum Can Manufacturer\nAn aluminum can manufacturer has discovered a way to improve its manufacturing process. As a\nresult, its manufacturing cost has been reduced from $0.89 to $0.79 cents.

The firm can either use a penetration strategy or price skimming\nstrategy. Consider the impact of either strategy on the company and its competitors. Also, don’t\nforget to think about any substitutes for aluminum cans.\nSolution:\nClearly, the client should either drop price or reap additional profits.\nIf the client drops prices, other competitors will have to follow since this is a commodity market\nand not following would mean a quick demise. The lowering of prices might increase the client’s\nmarket share marginally, but some smaller competitors will have to start exiting the industry and\nlarger competitors will have to start investing to discover the client’s cost advantage.\nAt the same time, steel can users sill start switching to aluminum cans, thus hurting\nmanufacturers in that market. The resulting growth in the aluminum can market will attract steel\ncan manufacturers to enter it. Since some steel can manufacturers have deep pockets and a strong\nbacking, these new entrants could pose a future threat to our client.\nIn conclusion, it is best to retain prices and generate extra profits for now. The cost advantage\nmay help another day during a price war.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Scientific Industry": "Scientific Industry\nA manufacturer of scientific instruments is experiencing declining sales in its major product line.\nWhy?\nInformation to be given if asked:\nProducts\n- The instrument, call it Y, is able to perform elemental mapping; that is, it is able to determine\nthe specific composition of material placed in the chamber for observation. Y is an accessory\nfor larger and much more expensive instrument that functions almost exactly like a\nmicroscope, which we'll call X.\n- Our client's product is regarded as one of the best in the market.\n- Aside from Y, the client recently began manufacturing X. Additionally, it produces an\nunrelated product.\n- Product X can be used by itself, but Product Y is essentially dependent on Product X for its\noperation. As a result, except for replacement sales, Y is rarely sold individually. In fact,\nProduct X's sales force will frequently recommend that a buyer purchase a certain Y while\nbuying an X. Two years ago, over 30% of our client’s sales were generated by another\nmanufacturer of X.\n- The client’s product X competes directly with other manufacturers of X, and particularly the\nmanufacturer that was selling our Y. The client introduced X 1 ½ years ago.\nSales\n- Currently, 5% of sales come from recommendations from other manufactures.\n- The markets for X and Y are flat,\nCustomers/Demographics\n- There are two basic user groups: industry, primarily semiconductor manufacturers, and\nacademia (in research labs).\n- What we've noticed lately is that the specific users in each of these groups, who also happen\nto be the primary buyers, have become relatively less sophisticated; that is, they are hired just\nto run the instruments and know less about their technical qualities.\n- These buyers have become even more dependent on the sales forces.\n- What has happened is that our client alienated itself from other manufacturers of X at a time\nwhen a strong relationship was becoming even more important than it used to be. The buyers\nare relying more and more on the X sales force, which are typically called well in advance of\nthe Y sales force.\nSolution:\nThis is the second part of the main reason for our clients declining sales: in addition to ruining\ntheir relationships with manufacturers of X by producing their own, they happened to do so at a\ntime when relationships became even more important.",

This factory has purchased technology from a German company. Your client\ndoes not have much information about this competitor, but it appears that their factory is\nextremely efficient. They have also been undercutting your client on price.\nSolution:\nThe competitor has used their new technology to produce a lower price product. As evidenced in\nthe Philadelphia / New Jersey market, nearly all customers prefer this product to your client’s.\nTherefore, the future is extremely bleak for your client, and they should be advised to respond to\nthe competitive threat, perhaps by updating their own technology.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Corn Feed Company": "Corn Feed Company\nA corn feed company has eight manufacturing plants located in the Midwest. These plants\nservice the entire United States. Their plant in Ohio is in need of refurbishing. The company has\nfour possible options:\n- Refurbish the existing plant\n- Build a larger plant at the current location\n- Build a similar size plant at a new location\n- Build a larger plant at a new location\nWhich is the best option for this plant?\nInformation to be given if asked:\nMarket\n- There are four main competitors; our plant is the second largest. All four competitors have\nsimilar manufacturing processes and similar cost structure.\nCapacity\n- Capacity utilization at the current Ohio plant is 65%, which is industry standard.\nCustomers\n- The current customers buy from all four manufacturers in order to guarantee supply.\n- Currently demand is being met and there are no alternative uses for corn feed.\nTransportation Costs\n- The transportation cost for the corn stock (raw material) is much higher than the cost of\ntransporting the actual feed.\n- The corn is grown in the Ohio area and the feed is sold to the East Coast.\nProduct\n- The raw material is perishable where as the corn feed can be stored for any length of time and\neasier to transport.\nSolution\nThere are two issues to this decision. The plant size and the plant location should be considered\nseparately.\n- Size of Plant- corn feed is a commodity product. Pricing on the product is dependent on\ncurrent corn prices as opposed to the manufacturing process. The purposed largest plant will\nnot have economies of scales not currently present at the existing plant. Without increased\neconomies of scale, there is no reason to increase the size of the plant.\n- Location of Plant- transportation cost and perishability are the main issues with location. Cost\nanalysis of the transportation cost of feed versus raw materials should be completed. This\nanalysis should include the % of spoilage for longer transportation of corn stock.\nThe current plant is located close to the cornfields and this is the best location for the plant from\nthe cost/benefit analysis. A larger plant should not be built.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Buenos Aires ENT": "Buenos Aires ENT\nMedical center in downtown Buenos Aires specialized in Ear, Nose and Throat, working at 90%\ncapacity, in a very competitive environment. They have contracts with all the HMOs & insurance\ncompanies and they see almost no private patients.\nThey are barely making profits, and they want to:\n- increase profits\n- increase market share\nWhat should they do?\nInformation to be given if asked:\nExternal Factors\n- Stable economical & political situation (1999), no inflation.\n- The institute has a good reputation in the community and a market share of 10% (one of the\nbiggest in this market).\n- Big competition, by a few institutes (especially one a few blocks from us with the same\nmarket share) and numerous ENT doctors in their offices with distribution all over the city\n(geographical advantage, they are closer to the patients).\n- The customers are the population with insurance, they don’t pay anything for their visits and\nthey come to us because of our reputation.\n- The most difficult thing for physicians in this market is to get the precious contracts with the\ninsurance companies, which we have all.\n- No merger possibilities with the other institute, since the owners dislike each other.\nFinancial\n- They could get money to do some improvements like new offices or surgical rooms in the\ncurrent space, but not to buy a new building (also the owners are very conservative).\nCosts\n- We cannot reduce costs much without risking their reputation. In fact we suspect they are\nalready eroding it because of recent cutbacks.\n- They have a reduced group of staff specialists, some of whom are the owners, who are paid on\na fee per service basis and only see selected patients.\n- Then there is a larger group of residents with low salaries who do the bulk work (they accept\nlow salaries and long working hours for the benefit of learning from the well-recognized\nspecialists).\n- The administrative and nursing staff receives standard pay.\n- They expend in surgical and office supplies at market prices.\nRevenues\n- Revenues are slightly higher than costs.\n- Their prices are low (i.e. $15 for a medical visit). They see about 5,000 external patients per\nmonth.\n- NOTE: One of the clues to this case is here, in the product mix because their main income is\nfrom surgeries. They make $1,000 on each surgery with a cost of $500, while they barely\nmake any profit from the office visits. Usually people trying to solve this case just focus in the\noffice visits and they forget about surgical or other practices.\n\nCapacity\n- There is some idle operating room capacity and they could easily build bigger facilities with\nlow investment. They are offering our facilities to external doctors and a few of them come to\ndo their surgeries here for a fee. It is very difficult to attract other specialists because they\nusually are forced by their HMO to perform surgeries in other places, or they prefer a clinic in\ntheir neighborhood, etc.\nSolution:\n- Franchise the name of the institution providing the contracts to groups of young specialists\nwith practice in far-off neighborhoods (especially to former residents from the institute).\n- The value proposition to these young MDs is 2 fold:\n- Opportunity to expand the scope of their practice\n- The ENT center would take care of physician billing and other back-office operations.\n- Value proposition to the ENT center:\n- The independent physicians would perform all their surgeries in the client facilities.\nThis will improve the capacity utilization of the ENT center. The physicians would\nreceive standard fee they would get anywhere else for their surgeries. Later the client\ncan expand the operating room facilities if needed.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Concrete Manufacturer": "Concrete Manufacturer\nYour client, a concrete manufacturer is considering acquiring a small local firm. What factors\nshould be considered? After considering these factors, would you recommend the acquisition?\nInformation to be given if asked:\nMargins\n- The target firm is currently profitable, with margins of 5%.\n- Your client’s margin is 15%.\n- Your client attributes its higher profit margin to economies of scale in trucking and mixing,\nand a stable labor force.\nMarket\n- Both companies compete in the geographical market, the Southeastern U.S.\n- Your client’s customers are large construction firms and contractors generally in the office\nand commercial building construction business.\n- The smaller firm sells mainly to other small businesses and contractors. (Swimming pool\ninstallation firms, patio builders, etc.)\n- Additional research shows that the smaller customers for concrete are growing, while the\nmajor office building construction market is stagnant.\n- The smaller firm has strong contacts with many local customers, and is often the preferred\nsupplier due to their customer responsiveness.\nFinancing\n- Your client is not able to fund the acquisition internally, but could obtain bank financing at a\nrate of 10%.\n- Similar acquisitions generally are made for two to three times current sales of the target firm.\nSolution:\nFrom a financial point of view, the acquisition is not attractive if there are no synergies between\nthe firms. With profit margins of only 5%, the income generated by the smaller firm will not\ncover the capital charges (interest due to the bank) on the acquisition price. (Acquisition price =\n3 x sales. Interest on this amount will be 10% x 3 x sales, or 30% of annual sales. Profits are only\n5% of sales. This analysis, of course, ignores the tax shields.)\nHowever, if your client were able to use some of its competitive advantages to improve the\nfinancial outlook of the target firm, the acquisition would be advisable. It is reasonable to expect\nthat synergies would arise from economies of scale in trucking and mixing, which could raise the\nprofit level of the target firm, and make the acquisition more attractive.",

The one in Africa.\n\nNow that the cost structure is established, the client should perform an NPV analysis based on\ncertain project sales volume.\nThe NPV analysis was positive.\nThe client should enter China for the following reasons:\n- The corporate market is growing rapidly (80% growth in 5 years). The corporate farms are\nmore likely to use vitamins than the small family farms.\n- The client should acquire the mine in Africa.\n- There is no significant competition.

  "Goizueta_2006_Chicago Loop (Booz Allen Hamilton)": "Chicago Loop (Booz Allen Hamilton)\nHow would you go about estimating the daily average number of motor vehicles in the Chicago\nLoop?\nSolution:\nAuthor’s Comments: Since I was not sure whether the interviewer wanted me to actually\ncalculate my best estimate or just brainstorm creative ways to do the calculation, I decided to ask\nhim beforehand. He offered me the following tradeoff: I could choose between going through the\ncalculation or outlying alternative ways to arrive at an estimate. However, by choosing the latter,\nI had to come up with at least three different procedures (and that’s exactly what I decided to do).\n- 1st Approach: Secondary research. Contact the transit authority and see if the measurement\nhas already been performed before. Similarly, downtown areas of cities of equivalent size\ncould also have done some previous studies on the topic.\n- 2nd Approach: Define the limits of the Loop and treat it as a system in which the units\nprocessed are motor vehicles. By measuring the rate in which cars get into and leave the\nsystem during the day, we could arrive at an estimate of the average “inventory” built into the\nsystem throughout the day. A sample of streets could be monitored (probably the most\ngenerally used) and the results could be extrapolated to the whole area.\n- 3rd Approach: Use a phone directory to estimate the number of offices in the Loop. From\nthere, estimate the number of people commuting to work everyday, and then the number of\ncars (discount people that car-pool or that use public transportation). This number will be a\npercentage of the total number of vehicles in the area, since we have to take into account the\nvehicles that are just driving through the Loop and heading somewhere else.\n- 4th Approach: Measure the quality of the air in the Loop in terms of the concentration of\ngases (from fuel combustion) throughout the day and contrast it with the expected average\ncontribution per vehicle.\nEach suggestion was complemented with a discussion on pros and cons, regarding accuracy,\ncosts, feasibility, time and resources needed.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Logging Company": "Logging Company\nYou are hired by a Canadian logging company to analyze its current operations and provide\nadvice on future operations. The government regulates the logging industry in Canada. Land is\nleased to individual companies by the government. The company is making a lot of money and is\nunsure why. You have been asked to determine: (1) Why they are making money? (2) Is it\nsustainable? (3) Is it replicable?\nInformation to be given if asked:\n- Products\n- The company produces lumber boards of two sizes 2”x4” and 2”x8”.\n- Lumber is a commodity product and the company is a price-taker in the market.\n- Costs\n- The government leases tracts of land at an annual price that is set to allow for a 12%\nprofit margin for the entire logging industry. Thus, all tracts of land have the same\nlease price per acre.\n- The leases last for 99 years and the original lessee has the right of first renewal.\n- The company has a 5% cost advantage in its ”tree-to-dock” production process. There\nis no significant difference between the distribution costs among the industry firms.\n- Profit/Revenue\n- The profit equation for the lumber industry can be written as: Profit per ft^3 =\nRevenue per ft^3 - Non-land cost per ft^3 - Lease Cost per ft^3\n- There is a revenue advantage for the company due to its product mix.\n- Margins are higher on 2”x8” boards than on 2”x4” boards.\n- The company’s product mix is made up of a greater percentage of 2”x8” boards than\nthe “typical” logging company percentage.\n- Production Process\n- The cost advantage is not generated by a better logging process (i.e. better equipment,\nmore skilled laborers) but instead exists because of the exceptional quality of the trees\non the particular piece of land that the company leases. The mineral content of the\nland leads to faster growth of healthier trees, which improves both yield and turnover.\nHealthier trees are straighter and easier to cut, thus reducing costs in each phase of the\nlogging process. These healthier, taller, straighter trees yield more 2”x8” board feet\nthan is typical and leads to the advantaged product mix. There are no significant\neconomies of scale to the process.\nSolution:\n- The company leases land with a significantly higher quality of trees. This leads to a revenue\nadvantage because more 2”x8” board feet can be produced per acre of land. Additionally,\nthere is a cost advantage because the higher quality inputs make the logging process easier\nand increase yields and turnover.\n- Since the leases are for 99 years and renewable, the current situation seems sustainable.\n- Since it is unlikely that another piece of land similar to this one exists or that another firm\nwill give up advantaged land, the situation is not replicable.",

While most products that come off patent quickly\ndrop in price (e.g. pharmaceuticals), this product will be able to retain some of its premium due\nto the strong brand name.

For the client, Austria Star\nMobile (ASM), it will be their first launch of seven potential launches in Austria and they want it\nto be a flawless and successful in order to raise capital. Your team has just finalized the pricing\nstrategy and ordered 100,000 pieces of promotional material when you get a call from the CEO\nof Austria Star. The CEO says he was just at conference in Singapore with the president of the\nincumbent wireless provider, AT& M, who says that they will beat the price of any new entrant\nin Austria by 10%. The CEO of Austria Star wants to know how they should respond to this\nnews. What do you do?\nInformation to be given if asked:\n- Current Industry Structure/Market-share\n- AT&M currently controls 100% of the entire Austrian market for mobile and\nlandlines and 30% of the cable television market and operates extremely profitably\nwith all these products.\n- Two other mobile providers will enter the market 6 months after Austria Star.\n- The market is growing at 20% p.a.\n- Competitive Information\n- AT&M is known to have thorough coverage of Austria, but is known for busy lines,\ndropped calls, and haphazard service.\n- AT&M´s rates are a flat 10 per month plus .40 per minute, or flat 30 per month\nand .20 per minute, flat 60 per month and .10 per minute.\n- Your team has spent the last three months developing a highly flexible pricing model.\nThe model suggests that the optimum rates ex ante would be 15% less then AT&M\nand use the same three-level prices.\n- AT&M´s price cut would be for the entire Austria market, not just this region.\n- Costs\n- Mobile telecommunications is a high-fixed cost, zero marginal-cost business.\n- The cost structure of all providers is essentially the same (start-up costs, operating\ncosts, licensing, etc). Incumbent providers generally have a customer acquisition\ncosts that are 25% lower than new entrants do (acquisitions cost average 100 in\nother launch markets outside Austria).\n- Products\n- Austria Star will launch with the latest 3G (broadband) technology that transmits data\n2x faster than AT&Ms network.\nOther information\n- The managing partner on the account is on vacation and can’t be reached for three days.\nHowever, you teammates can be reached immediately.\n- The CEO of Austria Star is on route to Austria and will arrive at his office at 9:30 a.m.\n\nSolution:\nThe thing to recognize is that Austria T&M (the incumbent) is signaling that they will defend the\nmarket at most any cost (they are dropping rates in the entire country not just this market). This\nmakes price-based competition is less appealing and differentiation is more important.\nMost importantly, the interviewee should establish a clear program for communicating to the\nCEO and with her staff.\nIt is important for the interviewee to address what the CEO must be thinking and keep the CEO\ncomfortable.

  "Goizueta_2006_Corrosive Chemical": "Corrosive Chemical\nThe client is a division of an industrial chemicals firm. They are in the business of manufacturing\nfibers and have had sales of $1 billion. Their concern is that the sales have been declining\nsteadily over the past five years. Their objective is to identify three to five new lines of business\nwith total revenues of $300-500 million utilizing existing capacity in the fiber manufacturing\nfacilities. They have come up with a new fiber that has very good absorbency, something like 10\ntimes its weight, which is a breakthrough in the industry. The client is looking to enter the urban\npet care market in the U.S. with this new high-absorbency fiber. They want to manufacture pet\ncare pads, sort of diapers for pets in urban areas. The client would like us to evaluate the\npotential of this idea, which is where you come in.\nI would explore the following areas and in the process hopefully glean insights to whether or not\nthe pet care diaper sounds like an attractive option for our client. First, I’d like to learn more\nabout the client. Then I’d like to understand the market potential, then assess competitive trends\nand finally focus on the particular product in question and the client’s ability to execute with\nregard to bringing this product to market.\nSounds good.\nCan you tell me more about the client’s strengths?\nWell, they are an established industrial products manufacturer, their fibers are specifically used\nin the fashion apparel industry and for the manufacture of cigarette filters. They’ve had sales in\nthe billion-dollar range, so they are reasonably big.\nDo we know how strong their brand is in the customer’s mind? How strong are their marketing\nskills? The reason I ask is to understand whether or not our client is best suited to bring this\nproduct to market, if there is demand for it.\nTheir brand is pretty well known, but not necessarily directly by the end customer. They have not\ndone any marketing in the traditional sense and have no advertising experience at all.\nOh, I see. If they traditionally have not interacted directly with the customer, how does their\nvalue chain look like?\nGood question. They deal largely with distributors, who in turn sell the products to retailers. The\nretailers handle the relationship with the end customers.\nGreat. I’d like to modify my original framework slightly and explore this value chain a little\nfurther. How powerful are these intermediaries, and would the client want to continue to use\nthem in bringing the pet sponge to market?\nThe client prefers to continue using the intermediaries. They are reluctant to try things that they\nare not necessarily experienced in. The intermediaries know this and consequently the\ndistributors would demand a 50% markup while the retailers would require a 100% markup.\n\nInteresting! Why don’t I move to the next area of my original framework, market potential? Do\nwe have any research on the size of this market?\nNot really but how would you go about sizing the market?\nWell, I’d try to get a sense for the size of the urban pet owner market. Let’s assume that of the\n100 million households, 40% or 40 million households are urban households. Of these, let’s\nassume that 40% of the households, i.e., 16 million households, own pets. I’m considering only\ndogs and cats as relevant pets for the product. Let’s further assume that each of these households\nhas 1.5 pets. This results in about 24 million urban pets that are potential users of the sponge in\nquestion. I don’t have a good idea how often these sponges would need to be replaced. I know\nmy niece goes through 4 to 6 diapers per day. This is probably too high.\nYou’re right. Remember these are high absorbency sponges, but its not clear how tolerant pet\nowners would be to the smell. # Let’s assume that they would want to replace the sponge every\nother day.\nOK, that would result in 24 million times about 180 sponges a year or 4.32 billion sponges\nannually. Wow, that seems like a pretty big number! With a 20% market share, our client should\nbe able to sell – assuming that there is a customer need for it – about 800 million pads annually.\nBefore I figure out the dollar value of this market, let me try to understand if there are any\ncompetitive products in the market, how they are priced and if indeed there is a demand for these\nproducts.\nWell, there is no major national brand out there. Local pet stores tend to sell such pads for about\n50 cents per pad. The demand is quite small and sales are restricted to the local stores.\nIs our client’s proposed product any different from these local brands?\nNot really. It has much higher absorbency – that’s about it.\nHmmm. I wonder how our client hopes to differentiate this product and market it to the customer.\nAt any rate, let me assess the dollar revenue potential that this product is likely to generate. If the\nproduct is priced at the current market levels of 50 cents a sponge, the 100% retailer markup\nmeans that the distributor receives 25 cents and the 50% distributor markup would leave the\nclient with only a little over 16 cents per sponge. With an ambitious annual sales estimate of 800\nmillion pads, the revenue potential is about $128 million.\nIs this good enough?\nWell, you did mention that the client is looking for 3 to 5 product ideas with $100 million\nrevenue potential each. This product idea meets this metric, but its not even clear if there is a\ncustomer need for the product and I’m not convinced the client has the execution quotient to\nbring this product to market.\n\nOkay. What else would you want to look at before you can make a final go/no go\nrecommendation?\nI’d like to evaluate the costs involved with this product launch. One thing to make sure is to\nensure the product makes a profit.\nThat would be a good thing. Anyway, looks like we are out of time…\nComing out of this interview, I was amazed at how broad the issue was and how many details\nthere were to keep in mind. The interviewer was quite helpful in guiding me along, but it is really\neasy to get off track. For example, I didn’t quite make the $100 million per idea client\nrequirement till the interviewer asked if my estimate of the revenue potential was good enough.\nWith different assumptions, I could have come up with very different estimates. I guess there is\nnot real right answer, eh?",
  "Goizueta_2006_Daft Drugs": "Daft Drugs\nThe client is a major pharmaceutical company. It has two new drugs in development, both of\nwhich are prescription treatment-type drugs (as opposed to preventative drugs) for osteoporosis,\na disease that affects older women. The development period for new drugs is ten years, but the\nlast three years – which involve testing – consume more than half of the cost. Thus, the client\nwants you to decide whether to test the two drugs, test one of the drugs, or to abandon the drugs\naltogether.\nFirst, however, I’d like to ask you to think through two problems for me. One is, what is the size\nof the potential market for osteoporosis, and two, how do you think the markets for preventative\ndrugs and treatment drugs differ?\nOkay, to begin with, let’s estimate the size of the market for osteoporosis drugs. I’ll assume that\nwe’re only looking at the United States for the moment, so the population of the U.S. is about\n270 million, slightly more than half of which is women. So say there are 135 million women in\nthe U.S. I think osteoporosis begins to be a concern in women over 50, so we need to figure out\nhow many women are over fifty.\nJust estimate broadly.\nOkay, well, my guess is that about 25% of the population is over 50, so that’s about 35 million\npotential customers – and we should remember that as the population ages, more people will fall\ninto this category, so potential customers will increase. Naturally, for a treatment drug, we would\nthen need to get the rates of incidence (to find out what percentage of women in the correct age\ngroup actually develop osteoporosis) and whether that is trending up or down.\nThat’s good, and it leads into the next question. How would the size of the market be different\nwith a preventative drug?\nWell, the number of people willing to take a preventative drug would depend on several things.\nFirst, the randomness of the disease – I don’t know much about osteoporosis, but if there’s a\nclear high-risk group, and few others get the disease, then those people are likely to be customers\nbut people outside the group are not. On the other hand, if the disease is really random in whom\nit strikes, then more people are at risk, but with a lower risk for each person. Thus, people would\nmake their decisions based on the cost of preventing the disease balanced against the\nconsequences of getting it. So, if there’s a treatment available that minimizes the problems\nassociated with getting the disease, then few people will take the prevention. On the other hand,\nif the disease is not treatable and has severe consequences, many people will want to take\npreventative measures. Then, it’ll come down to very pragmatic factors – is the drug easy to take\n– I mean, is it a simple pill every morning or is it several pills a day with restrictions on diet, etc?\nWill it be covered by insurance? Are there side effects? If the side effects are severe, they will\ncancel out the benefits of preventing the disease!\nSo tell me what the differences would be in marketing a preventative drug versus a treatment\ndrug, and what factors would affect the sales volumes of each.\n\n(Here I took a minute to sketch down some items in two columns).\nOkay, I’d say the first difference is going to be in whom the target for advertising is. Patients\nalready suffering from a disease will go to a doctor, so doctors will be the ones making choices\namong competing drugs. For a preventative drug, however, the patient will likely have more\ninfluence, because even if it’s a prescription drug, they may or may not choose to take it, and\nthey may find one drug more convenient than another and thus make a choice (while patients\nsuffering a disease are likely to put up with inconvenience to make themselves feel better).\nOkay, how would that change the marketing?\nWell, my guess is that doctors will respond most to effectiveness – because they will likely be\nmore scientific and have done more of their own research (even if it’s just talking to colleagues)\nabout a drug than patients. So that’s the most important thing to stress. Patients, however, will be\nless attuned to the science behind the medicine, and will also be very conscious of side effects,\nconvenience, etc. So a treatment drug would be mainly advertised in medical publications and\nsimilar areas, with a stress on the effectiveness of the medication. A preventative drug, however,\nwould likely be advertised more broadly, targeting the group that might be at risk for the disease,\nand stressing the awful consequences of getting the disease and how easy and safe it is to take\nthe prevention.\nOkay, that’s good. Let’s talk about the client’s problem. Should he spend the money to finish\ndeveloping the two drugs?\nAre they treatment drugs or preventative drugs?\nAt the moment they’re treatment drugs, although they could be preventative drugs in the future.\nThe normal pattern is for drugs to come out as treatments, because longer testing is required to\nprove value as a preventative. So the drug will be released as a treatment and then the company\nwould continue testing to see if it has value as a preventative. But consider the shorter-term\npossibilities as a treatment drug.\nOkay, first I’d look at the consequences of the two choices – to test or not to test. For the\ndecision to test, I’d want to look at the likelihood of success, to find out whether success was\nlikely in general and whether the two drugs had different chances of being successful. (Etc., etc.\nfor the whole tree).\n\nOkay, those are all important issues. Is there one thing you’d want to find out first?\nYes, I’d want to find out about competition - are we the first company to develop a treatment for\nosteoporosis? If not, is our treatment significantly different?\nThat’s a crucial question. No. In fact, both drugs we’re producing are essentially the same as\ndrugs our competitors already have out on the market?\nAre we producing generic drugs that will cost less?\nNo, we would not compete on price.\nDoes anything else distinguish our drugs? More effective? Fewer side effects? Anything?\nNo.\nHow well have the existing drugs done?\nThey’ve done very well. They’re the dominant treatments of the disease.\nSo we’re just going to duplicate their drugs to enter the market?\nYes. Our drugs will work in essentially the same way as the existing drugs.\nOkay, so to be successful, we’d have to differentiate our product somehow, or maybe our size in\nthe market would allow us to gain share just by entering the market – because of purchasing\narrangements, brand name, etc.\nNo, the competitors are just as big as we are. How would you go about differentiating a product\nthat nearly duplicates an existing product in the market?\nWell, one way would be advertising, so that you could potentially make patients ask for our drug\nover the others. Another way would be on cost, but we don’t want to do that. We might have\ncertain distribution channel advantages – contracts with hospitals, insurance companies,\ndrugstores, etc, to exploit to help.\nAnything else?\nUmmmm. (I think he was looking for a specific additional point, but I couldn’t think of anything\nelse. So he let me off the hook).\nWell, that is okay. What would your recommendation be?\nIt doesn’t seem like it’s worth investing all the money when there doesn’t seem to be a clear way\nto steal share from the existing products. On the other hand, a big provider or drugs may not\n\nwant to be left out of a particular market, for fear of losing other markets to a competitor with a\nfull range of products.\nThat makes sense. What if I told you that we found out while doing our research that a small\nstart-up company on the West Coast was developing a new type of treatment that would\nessentially make the existing treatment obsolete?\nWhat are its chances of being a technical success? And when would it come out?\nWe are fairly certain it will work if the firm can get financing to undertake the expensive last\nthree years of development. We even know how the new drug works. They’re about to begin that\nright now – so it’ll be at least three years until it reaches market.\nThen, first of all, I’d probably cancel testing of the existing drugs immediately even the\npossibility that the drug will become obsolete adds to the problems of the crowded marketplace\nand makes it a bad investment. If we’re fairly certain that the drug will succeed, it’s unlikely they\nwon’t be able to find someone to finance the testing.\nWhat would you tell the client to do?\nWell, he could do a few things. If there is a chance that the start-up will get delayed in bringing\nthe new drug to market, we could use what we know to develop it ourselves and beat them to\nmarket. But they’ve got a seven-year head-start on us, if our development takes the standard ten\nyear period. We could try to hamper their development somehow – perhaps using our size in the\nmarket – but that wouldn’t work for long anyway. They’re a small company?\nYes.\nAnd the client is a large company with lots of resources?\nYes.\nWell, then maybe they should buy the start-up – that way, the start-up would get its capital, and\nthe client would have a new drug that would trounce the competition in only three years.\nGood. That’s what we told them, and that’s what they did.",
  "Goizueta_2006_China Cancer": "China Cancer\nOur client is a major pharmaceutical company based in the U.S. with international reach. They\nare known in the industry for their cancer drugs. Recently, the company has experienced a\ndecline in sales growth and is considering a new business opportunity. The U.S. market has\nmany private companies that focus solely on cancer care. The client wants to own and operate a\nchain of private cancer care centers in China. These would be “out patient” type centers where\npatients could come in for treatments; long and short-term stays are possible. How would you\nevaluate the attractiveness of this opportunity?\nI would evaluate the market for such a center in China: demand, competition and regulation. I\nwould also assess the profit potential of the opportunity and consider if the company can take\nadvantage of its strong reputation. To assess the demand for the cancer care center, we would\nneed to determine the number of people in China with cancer.\nHow would you estimate that?\nWell, we can look at the number of people currently being treated through cancer care units of\nhospitals, private care, etc. Alternatively, we could estimate the percentage of the population\nwith cancer by looking at affliction rates across various countries and then multiply by the total\npopulation of China.\nOk, let’s say that this is a large number and it is growing…what next?\nWell, I want to look at the competitors in the market. You said the U.S. market already had a lot\nof cancer care centers; I’d want to find out who the major competitors are in China.\nActually, there are no cancer care centers like this currently in China; it would be a new concept.\nWho do you think the competitors would be for our client?\nI would assume hospitals, nursing homes, private nurses. Also, China has a history of treating\nailments through herbs and other natural substances; these old world physicians are probably a\nmajor competitor.\nYou’re right. When we worked on this project, we found that a significant number of patients\nwere being treated under these methods. Let’s say there is still room in the market for our client\nto enter despite this. What else would you look at?\nWell, then it comes down to the profitability of the centers. Profits are comprised of revenues\nand costs. Let’s look first at the revenues, which are comprised of the number of treatments and\nthe price per treatment. Since the center would focus strictly on cancer, I would assume the\nquality of the service would be better than the competition. [Interviewer nods yes]. Therefore, we\ncould probably charge a premium for the treatments.\nOh? Do you think you can? Who is paying for the treatments?\n\nHmm…you have a good point. Here in the US, the patient’s healthcare plan covers the cost of\nthe treatment. Can you tell me about China’s medical care policies? Do healthcare companies\ninsure consumers?\nActually, in China the government pays for all healthcare. In fact, the government has\npredetermined fees that it will pay for all kinds of treatments. They will not pay for more than\nthat amount.\nI see. So our client cannot charge a premium and expect the government to cover the expenses.\nAt the same time, since our client is providing premium service, I would expect that their costs\nare higher than those of hospitals, etc. Our client may not even be able to cover the cost of the\ncare they want to provide through the predetermined rates. [Interview nods yes.] Ok, so now we\nhave a different scenario. I think the client needs to assess if there is sufficient demand amongst\nthe wealthier segments of the Chinese population for a cancer care center.\nHow would you determine the size of this new market?\nWell, I think we can first segment the population of China based upon income and focus in upon\nthe top income levels. We can then apply the percentage of cancer incident to this number to\nestimate the number of potential cancer patients in the selected segments. Perhaps we can\ncalculate the cost of serving each patient and fixed costs to determine a breakeven number of\npatients. We can compare this breakeven number with the total potential cancer patients to\ndetermine the market share the client needs before they can turn a profit. Hopefully, this market\nshare is reasonable and the client can move forward.\nWell, you’ve covered most of the points that we looked into. Great job! Our client actually did\nmove forward with the opportunity and was very successful.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Deep Discounts": "Deep Discounts\nMajor discount retailer with over 1300 pharmacies. Pharmacy operations have flat sales in\ngrowing industry. Profitability is very poor relative to industry. Chain has history of\ndecentralized pricing and promotion for pharmaceuticals, leading to strong autonomy in field\noperations, as well as wildly inconsistent pricing. Customer pricing complaints and customer\nattrition is chronic. New head of pharmacy operations has engaged us to “solve” the pricing issue.\nHow should we proceed?\n- Who are the customers? How do they select a pharmacy? How important is price? Customers\nare generally older, repeat, discount-sensitive shoppers (as opposed to convenience oriented\nshoppers). Customers may initially select a pharmacy on referral, location, or price and tend\nto build strong loyalty to pharmacy sue to personal relation with pharmacist and high\nswitching costs (transfer of records, etc.…). Price tends to be a major factor. Particularly\ngiven nature of customer (usually pay in cash from fixed income) and trust relationship (Price\nfluctuations tend to be very bad). Inconsistent pricing on a give item may lead to price\nshipping, exposing all purchases to scrutiny and losing a customer.\n- How do we Price? We generally recommend a standard mark-up from cost, with price\nmatching to be determined by the pharmacist at the store. As mentioned before, this leads to\nwildly different pricing from store to store, as different pharmacists are vigilant to different\ndegrees regarding optimal pricing strategies.\n- Who are competitors? How do competitors price? Competitors come in three distinct groups:\nchain drug stores (Walgreen’s, Duane Reed, etc.), independent pharmacies, and discount\nchains with pharmacy operations (Wal-Mart, Kmart). Client is in the “discount” group, but\ncompetition is fierce between groups.\nNext step, Pricing study: Select a market basket of items in commonly dispensed quantities and\ncall for prices from a selection of competitors’ and our stores across the country. (Study finds\nthat prices on high volume items are very erratic, from our prices at the higher end to well below\ncost at some discounters. Less common items display more consistent pricing across chains, with\nour prices more or less in line. The items with the most aggressive pricing are maintenance items\nthat are taken for the rest of a patient’s life like heart, diabetes, and cholesterol. They represent\nan unavoidable expense and customers are very sensitive to pricing on these items).\nSolution: Test a pricing program where prices are set centrally for a number of stores in different\nmarkets. In this test, set prices very aggressively for items identified as key items, and try to\nmake up margins on non-key items. Monitor results, adapt and roll out if volume and profits\nwarrant.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Power Transformers Market-share (BCG)": "Power Transformers Market-share (BCG)\nA manufacturer of power transformers has been experiencing a decline in the market share. The\nclient has the biggest market share in the industry, closely followed by number 2 and 3 players.\nNumber 4 and 5 players have been relatively new competitors, been able to gain market share\nquickly. Our client has been experiencing declining revenues and profits. What should the client\ndo?\nPossible Solution 1:\n(I used very little frameworks, I had to ask a lot of questions to find out all the info. The\ninterview was very interactive.)\nIt turns out that there has been no new technology in the industry and our client's prices have\nbeen relatively stable. The product is sold mostly to utilities by bidding, and lately, we have not\nbeen winning enough bids. Therefore, our competitors must have been able to undercut us on\nprice. The hypothesis then is that they have a lower cost structure but we don't have any info on\ntheir cost structure. The product does not differ much in quality.\nWhen our client receives the order, the engineers design the product based on the specifications\ngiven. It turns out that engineers spent a lot of time designing the products because they enjoy\ncoming up with innovative ideas. However, they are not necessarily adding value by designing\ncool power transformers.\nThe products can be classified into three categories (medium, large, and something - not\nimportant), in each of these categories the manufacturing process is somewhat similar.\nTherefore:\n1. Break down each activity as a percentage of total cost.\n2. You will find out that design is really a much bigger percentage of total costs than what it\nshould be.\nRecommendations:\n1. Engineers need to be explained how their work affects the cost of all subsequent activities,\nsuch as assembly, purchasing, etc. They need to design with cost savings in mind, for example,\nuse the same components when necessary instead of carrying huge inventories of every possible\ncomponent.\n2. Share knowledge from one project to another, they shouldn't have to duplicate the design part\nthat applies to every transformer every time.\nPossible Solution 2:\nOther A: Revenues falling can mean one of three things:\nprices are steady and quantity is falling, or\nquantity is steady and price is falling, or\nboth price and quantity are falling.\n\nAfter a series of questions, I discover that the firm has been losing bids with their customers,\nutility companies. To discover why, I backed up and considered the market that the firm was\noperating and found out that they had 4 other competitors bidding on transformer sales. The #2\nand #3 competitors were also losing revenues (and market share) while the #4 and #5\ncompetitors were gaining share. The #4 and #5 companies were starting to win more bids from\nthe government because they always came in at the lowest price. Their ability to do this (as I\nlater discovered) was due to an effective integration of their bid, design and manufacturing\nprocesses, which lowered their operating expenses and allowed them to come in with lower bid\nprices yet maintain their margins.\nAn alternative approach would entail:\nTaking inventory of all real estate holdings\nDetermining redundancies by location.\nCombining those facilities where there will still be utilization is under capacity.\nFor those facilities where utilization would exceed capacity, determine NPV of staying put,\nexpanding existing facilities, or renting new space.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Hospital Profits (McKinsey)": "Hospital Profits (McKinsey)\nSituation:\nA not-for-profit hospital asked McKinsey to help reduce the $10 million loss that the\norganization was experiencing for the last 3 years. If the hospital continued this level of loss for\nmore than 2 more years, then the hospital endowment would be completely gone and the hospital\nwould need to close its doors. Quick action was necessary.\nProblem:\nThe chairman of the hospital’s board asked you to help develop a plan to quickly return the\nhospital to a small profit. What framework would you use to help you frame the issues?\nSolution:\nThe best framework for this case is probably the profitability framework (cost/revenue first\nbranch). Try to think through how this structure might apply to a hospital setting.\nSituation:\nThe McKinsey team quickly realized that the hospital’s loss was due to a new law which\nbasically fixed hospital prices because of the new DRG (diagnosis related groups) hospital\npayment system in New York State (i.e. price per unit could not be changed).\nProblem:\nWhat profitability improvement levers should the team focus on first if the team wants to quickly\nreduce the hospital’s loss? What would you expect to find?\nSolution:\nA good approach to this issue might discuss the different costs associated with performing the\nhospital’s services and the current capacity vs. demand for the hospital. The correct conclusion\nis that t is quicker and easier to change the cost structure and capacity of an organization than to\nchange the demand for the hospital’s service (remember the price per unit is fixed so the revenue\nlever remaining is increasing the units of service). As it turned out, the hospital had more\ncapacity than necessary and very high fixed costs. Reducing the capacity and shifting some costs\nfrom fixed to variable would help restore the hospital’s profit.\nA more complete answer would discuss some of the revenue levers even though they may take\nlonger to work. The team could explore some of the marketing issues such as:\nWhat draws physicians and patients to a hospital and from where do the patients come? (It turns\nout that most of the patients come from the local communities surrounding a hospital and that\nfocusing efforts on local neighborhoods that are underrepresented by the hospital can increase\npatient volume.)\nHow does the client hospital compare to the competitors along service dimensions that are\nimportant to patients and admitting physicians? (The hospital was outstanding at patient care but\nlacked convenience.)\n\nWhat are the trends in patient care and how should the hospital change to exploit the\nopportunities? (Recent trends are toward outpatient services and away from admitting patients\nfor long periods of time. For example, cataract surgery used to be an inpatient procedure\nrequiring a hospital stay of three days or more. In the last few years, most of the cataract\nprocedures performed require no hospital stay. There seems to be an opportunity providing a\nvery convenient outpatient facility to the community.)",
  "Goizueta_2006_Eye-drops Pricing (McKinsey)": "Eye-drops Pricing (McKinsey)\nSituation:\nYou have worked as a McKinsey associate for two years and have recently become an\nengagement manager. As you complete your preparation for a progress review, a former client\ncalls you needing immediate help.\nThe client, a marketing vice-president of a major pharmaceutical firm, is working on a business\nplan for a new revolutionary product. The client quickly explains that their researchers have\ndeveloped eyedrops which completely eliminate nearsightedness in 60% of the cases (the cases\ncaused by eye strain rather than irregularly shaped eye lenses) if the drops are used twice a day.\nProblem:\nThe client has been working on a business plan but is having a difficult time with one piece of\ninformation. The client needs a directional estimate of the retail price they should set for the\ndrops so that he can complete the business plan. How would you help the client structure his\nthinking on the price and what is your back-of-the-envelope estimate on the price that he should\nuse in the business plan?\nSolution:\nOne rough cut pricing analysis would determine the market price for the product that is being\nreplaced...in this case, eyeglasses or contact lenses. For example, if eyeglasses cost $120 and\nlast on average 2 years, then a two-year supply of drops could be sold for $120.\nA more advanced analysis might determine that eyedrops are simple to use and completely\ntrouble-free so that they should replace the most expensive option including all the costs\nassociated with that option. For example, this may include $100 per year in optometrist fees,\n$180 in contact lenses ($120 per pair plus on average each user loses on lens in a year), and $25\nin contact lens cleaning solutions and other supplies, for a grand total of $305. Using this\nexample, the retail price of the one year supply of drops should sell for $305.\nThe most advanced issue trees will include the fact that this new product is actually much better\nthan the alternatives, issues of dynamic pricing strategies (e.g. start high and reduce over time to\nbest understand elasticities), and pricing so that marginal revenue equals marginal cost.\nProblem:\nAfter talking through the pricing issue, you agree with the client that the price of the drops\nshould be roughly $200 per year. Because you have been so helpful, the client wants to discuss\none more issue.\nYou look at your watch and determine that you have precisely 10 more minutes before you\nabsolutely must leave for your progress review. The client explains that he needs to complete his\nbaseline business plan within an hour so that he can share it with the management committee\nlater that afternoon. He would like you to help him produce a ballpark estimate of the market for\n\nthe product. Specifically, what dollar level of sales might he be able to expect per year in the\nlong run in the US market?\nSolution:\nBecause you have already estimated a reasonable price, you must now estimate the number of\nyearly supplies that the client can expect to sell in the US. One possible organizing structure\n(with estimates) is:\nEstimate the number of people in the US 250 million\nEstimate the percentage of (1) using corrective eyewear 20%\nEstimate the percentage of (2) that are nearsighted 70%\nUse the client’s figure for the percentage of (3) that can be helped 60%\nEstimate the percentage of people that will adopt the new product 50%\nPut it all together: (250 million)(.2)(.7)(.6)(.5) = 10.5 million people\nMultiply be the price per unit (10.5 million)($200 per unit) = $2.1 billion\nNOTE: this assumes a proprietary product with no competition. If a competitor is assumed,\nmarket share must also be considered.",
  "Goizueta_2006_HMO Profitability (McKinsey)": "HMO Profitability (McKinsey)\nBackground on HMOs:\nAn HMO is a form of health insurance in which customers pay a fixed monthly fee for coverage\nwhich does not change based on the quantity of services provided. Often times, customer do pay\na nominal ($5 or $10) co-payment when they use the services of the HMO.\nIn return for this fixed payment arrangement, customer of HMOs must select physicians and\nhospitals who are on a pre-approved list, as determined by the HMO organization. The HMO\norganization then contracts with physicians and hospitals to provide services to the customers at\nan agreed-upon price.\nEach party receives value from the type of arrangement:\nPhysicians and hospitals get guaranteed business when their customers need service\nCustomers get a lower price for their health care\nThe HMO organization makes money on the difference between what the customers pay and\nwhat the physicians/hospitals charge\nBackground:\nMcKinsey is working for a large insurance client who owns seven HMOs in several different\ngeographic markets throughout the country. (These HMOs are of the type where they contract\nwith physicians/hospitals for their services, rather than having these professionals on their\npayroll, like the Kaiser HMO model). Six of the seven HMOs are currently profitable, however,\non market - Purgatory, TX - is losing over $4 million per year.\nYour client is particularly concerned about their image as a player in HMOs, given upcoming\nhealth care reform. They believe it is critical to have profitable HMO operations in every HMO\nmarket, and are therefore very worried about Purgatory dragging down earning of their overall\nHMO operation.\nThey know that the medical costs of Purgatory are higher than the competition in this market, but\nhave not been able to reduce those costs given the small scale of the operation. Large scale is\ntypically the best way to negotiate lower costs with physicians and hospitals, thereby lowering\nmedical costs, which are the bulk (about 85%) of any HMOs cost base. The remainder of the\ncost is S, G, & A. Your client is currently one of the smallest players in the market. Given this\ndire situation, they have asked McKinsey to help them determine how to handle the Purgatory\nmarket.\nQuestion:\nWhat key issues would you want to probe to begin to address the issue of what to do in the\nPurgatory market? Develop an outline of the areas you would like to learn more about and the\nspecific key questions you would like answered about each area.\nSolution:\n\nSince costs cannot be reduced given your client’s current scale, you may first want to determine\nif there are opportunities to generate increased revenue to cover your cost base. To do this you\nmay use a variety of frameworks. One useful framework may be the 4 P’s. Using this\nframework as a guide, you can develop a comprehensive set of questions to better understand the\nexisting revenue improvement opportunity.\nProduct – How do your client’s product features compare to that of competitors, e.g. hospitals\nand physicians in the network, types of illnesses covered? Which of these features matter most\nto the consumer?\nPrice – How does your client’s pricing compare to that of competitors? If it is higher, do product\nfeatures support this higher price? How price sensitive is the consumer?\nPromotion – Is your client developing enough demand pull by using advertising and promotion?\nPlace – How productive are your client’s sales channels versus that of competitors?\nAdvanced solutions will first clarify the extent of the cost problem. Specifically, if market level\nprices are below the client’s marginal cost - which is indeed the case - selling more product at\ncompetitive price levels will only further damage profitability in the short term. In this case, the\npricing lever should be the focus of further analysis.\nBackground:\nMore facts about Purgatory – After some fact finding, you discover a number of key issues\nregarding the Purgatory HMO market and your client’s position.\nProduct:\nAll products in the market have comparable features, e.g. contract with same hospitals and\nphysicians, offer similar coverages. Your client is unlikely to be able to develop a product\nfeature that cannot be quickly copied by competitors.\nPrice:\nHMO consumers are very price sensitive.\nYour client’s prices are slightly higher than that of market leaders.\nPromotion:\nYour client does very little promotion, however, the effectiveness of spending on promotion has\nnot been proven.\nPlace:\nThere are two ways to sell HMO products – through independent sales agents and a direst\nsalesforce. Your client does not have a direct salesforce. However, a quick calculation has\nindicated that until the product is profitable on a marginal cost basis, adding a direct salesforce\nwill only exacerbate the current profitability problem short term.\nQuestion:\nGiven the constant talk regarding healthcare reform, your client is desperate for an early clue as\nto what you think they should do in Purgatory. Their primary objective is to have profitable\n\nHMO operations to report to industry analysts, therefore the losses in Purgatory must be\naddressed.\nIn response to their needs, you must develop a hypothesis for what you believe the client should\ndo in this market based on the facts you now have. In addition, you must identify the key\nquestions that must be addressed to confirm or refute your hypotheses. Furthermore, to make\nthem comfortable with how you will proceed, you must give them a sense of the types of\nanalyses you will do to further address your outstanding questions.\nSolution:\nA potential range of answers exists. The key here is logical support for the selected hypothesis\nbased on the few facts that are available.\nThe bottom line for relatively small HMOs in markets such as Purgatory is that they are much\nlike any start-up business, expected to consume cash versus to make a profit for a period of time\nbefore a significant sale is reached. This is because medical costs – the key component of an\nHMO’s cost – are inversely proportional to scale, e.g. a large HMO can negotiate very low rates\nwith physicians and hospitals because their size provides them with market power. However, to\ngain membership in an HMO, prices must be competitive. Therefore, in the early years of an\nHMO, losses should be expected due to the need for market level pricing concurrently with\nhigher than competitive cost.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Additional Questions (With abbreviated solutions)": "Additional Questions (With abbreviated solutions)\n- Midwest Bank (BCG): You have been asked by the President of a Midwest bank to see if PC-\nbased or online banking is something that his firm should pursue. His bank is in 3 states and\nhe has #2 market-share. He is skeptical and does not think that he can generate much profit\nbecause his competition does not charge for their services, yet there are fixed costs in setting\nup such an endeavor. However, he is concerned because the larger east and west coast banks\nare entering the market and offering online banking. What should he do?\nDefinitely 3 Cs: After a series of questions, I discovered the nature of the customer\nsegment that such a service would target (i.e.: families and individuals with a lot of\nfinancial transactions that would be find value with the convenience of at home banking). I\nhad to do a quick market sizing brain teaser (i.e.: 100 mm households, 30% with PCs, 10%\nuse PCs for more than email, games and word processing, ec.) to realize that the products\npurchased by the few customers who would tend to use online banking provided the\nmajority of the profits for a bank (i.e., sort of like an 80-20 Pareto rule). The fixed costs of\nlaunching the project were found to be somewhat small. I ended up recommending that the\nbank should launch an online banking service because of the need to retain the high profit\ncontribution customers.\n- Tiring Company (Mitchell Madison): Your client is a tire manufacturer. How do you market\ntheir tires? The product was not any different from competitors, and the company did not\nhave competitive advantages.\nSeemed to be looking for customer segmentation: Price Sensitive and Price Insensitive.\nSo how do you sell this product to both consumers?\nDo you charge the price that the sensitive customer will pay?\nBut then you're loosing out on the revenue the insensitive customer would have provided.\nOption: mail coupons out. the price sensitive customer will look in circulars and use it.\nthe insensitive will not sift through papers. Will go in and pay the full price.\nOther ideas:\n- Market hard to retailers as many consumers ask for recommendations.\n- Educate consumers on the need to change their tire every x miles or months.\n- Could add additional services, i.e. someone come to house to change tires, free oil\nchange (must work with retailers to do this)\n- Competing with Goodyear who has strong brand equity. Do we do a blimp? Or, like\nDunlop, tennis balls?\n- Customers will likely not understand any competitive advantage we have\n- Pricing will have to be competitive with other tire companies\n- Other customer segments: those who only buy Goodyear, those who routinely change\ntires, those who buy recycled tires\n- Would we want to sell to car dealers? Would likely have to have contract with one and\nthat would give them a lot of power over us and we would be dependant on their sales\nOther Answer: The tire was on par with competitors and my company was not a big name\nin the market. They seemed to want me to focus on efficiency of spending advertising\ndollars. Especially on targeting the right customer segments by utilizing something like\ncar purchasing and demographic data to determine who might be buying replacement tires.\n- Belco Bloopers (PriceWaterhouse Coopers): Case was based on Bellco. I had to read a two-\npage case write-up and answer 3 questions. It was an issue of strategic options for a regional\n\ntelephone company (still under the protection of government regulation) to go pursue\ninvestments into video dial tone technology or not, given the continuous entrants into that\nmarket. (, unknown date)\nThis was a case with many possible approaches. The key was to identify what were the\noptions available to the company and what information would be needed in order to make\na good decision. Porter's 5 Forces is good here. Also mention the role of government and\nwhat might happen with deregulation. With any investment, NPV must be determined.\nAlso could pursue joint venture or acquisitions. As long as the argument was reasonable,\nyou could make the argument that it was a viable option (including doing nothing!)\n- Anderson Entrepreneur: Think of a business that you could start at the Anderson School (i.e.,\ncatering to students/faculty at Anderson). Walk me through the analysis of starting that\nbusiness. (Unknown company, 1999)\nMy idea was to start a company that provided video of Anderson student interviews for\nrecruiters on the web. The interviews would be conducted by a licensed, regulated third-\nparty like an ETS type organization. The interview could consist of resume, fit and case\nquestions which would be video-recorded by the company. The company would put the\nvideo on the web, and charge consulting (and other) firms a fixed fee to access the site.\nThe key benefit is that it would eliminate the need for first round interviews. I tried to\ncalculate how much value would accrue to the consulting firms (e.g., 4 interviews at an\naverage billing rate of $250/hour times 8 hours) to drive my pricing. I also tried to gauge\nacceptance from the key stakeholders (students, CMC, recruiters)\n- Cruise Choice: A company is considering purchasing one of two cruise lines. “A” operates in\nthe Mediterranean and has an initial cost of $25 million, while “B” operates in the Caribbean\nand has an initial cost of $50 million. Both lines are profitable, and the company has an ROA\nof 20%. Which one would you choose? How would you start your analysis? What factors do\nyou need to consider?\nFactors/Issues to consider:\n- What is the goal/motive for purchase (diversification, extension of existing business\nline, profit, etc.)?\n- What are any potential synergies or core competencies that the company can leverage\nto this business?\n- Are there environmental factors, e.g., political, international, economic such as\ninflation, exchange rates, tax rates, demand cycles.\n- What is each cruise line’s useful life? (Assume 10 years.)\nAssume all of the above does not significantly impact your analysis and go with the choice\nthat will yield the highest NPV. (Assume tax rate is 60% for “A” and 40% for “B”.)\nChoices:\n1. Do nothing (NPV=0)\n2.

What factors should it consider? How should it\ngo about doing this? What factors are critical for its success?\nBefore answering this market entry question, the interviewee should set up a basic\nframework to use as a guide to uncover the relevant issues. The following is an example\nof one such framework.\nCompany:\n1. What are its motives for entering this market?\n2. What are the firm’s distinct strengths/core competencies it can leverage to succeed\n(e.g., proprietary technology, low-cost production, non-unionized labor)\n3. Can it fund diversification through a joint venture, acquisition, or build the\noperation?\n4. Will the company have access to suppliers for inbound and outbound logistics (raw\nmaterials for manufacturing and distribution channels of finished goods)? Or will\nit have to build its own channels?\nMarket:\n\n1. How attractive is the U.S. market and can it withstand a new entry?\n2. What are the reasons for the current growth and is it sustainable?\n3. How is the market different from the others the company is in? What are the\ndrivers of success in the U.S. market, e.g., price, quality, delivery, brand equity, or\nexisting relationships?\n4. Are there any barriers to entry, e.g., economies of scale or scope, product\ndifferentiation, government or legal barriers, retaliation by existing firms, etc.?\nCompetition:\n1. Who are the major competitors in the market? What are their strengths &\nweaknesses?\n2. Are more competitors expected to enter the market? Retaliation by existing firms?\n3. What control over suppliers and other resources does the competition have?\n4. How does your firm compare to competitors in the US market?\nCustomers:\n1. Do we know who the main customers are, e.g., private real estate developers, end\nusers, or the government?\n2. Have customer’s preferences changed? Is there strong brand loyalty?\n3. What do customer’s place a premium on? What is price elasticity?\n- Fire Flyer: A large commercial airline is in the process of evaluating the merits of its frequent\nflyer program. How would you determine the value of this program?\n- The value of this program is the benefits minus the costs.\n- Benefits can be determined by finding out (a) how many clients switch due to frequent\nflyer incentives and (b) how much do these customers pay for a ticket when they do so.\n(Ways to determine this additional revenue include marketing research, customer\nquestionnaires, or comparing flight booking trends before the program was offered to\nthe number of bookings during the flyer program.)\n- The cost is determined by demand side factors such as most traveled seasons or days of\nthe week, most traveled destinations, demographic characteristics of those who redeem\nmiles, and segmenting the customer base into business and leisure given their different\nprice elasticities.\n- The cost is also determined by supply side drivers such as the number of frequent flyer\nmiles given away or the number of miles redeemed. (This information should be\nreadily available to the airline through the ticket coding on the CRS that books airline\nflights.)\n- The cost is also driven by incremental administrative, logistical, in-flight, advertising\nand promotion costs of the program.\n- A good way to calculate the cost would be $ per frequent flyer passenger mile or mile\nredeemed.\n- You may suggest ways to reduce or limit these costs by improving operations of the\nprogram or limiting the window of opportunities during which passengers can redeem\nmiles.\n- Book Bomber: You are a new associate at McKinsey and get a call from a partner that is\nforming a team to help a major book publisher explore strategic opportunities and risks. She\nasks if you are available for lunch today. If so, she would like to discuss the industry over\nlunch. You explain to her that you do not have experience in the industry but would enjoy\nhaving lunch with her today. You do not want to disappoint the partner, but she has set high\n\nexpectations for your lunch conversation. How would you structure your thought process for\nthinking through the strategy of the book publisher? What are your experiences with books\nwhich will help you think through the current issues in book publishing? What types of\nstrategies might help the client?\nThe first framework that come to mind for thinking through a strategy case is the “Forces\nat Work” (Porter) framework. The students should be able to think through the elements\nof the framework based on their experiences:\n- Increasing buyer power has been increasing due to the movement away from the corner\nbookstore toward the large chains (e.g. Barnes and Noble) that give discounts to\nreaders off the publishers price.\n- Increasing substitutes caused by video games, videos, cable systems, books on tape,\nand video on demand.\n- Increasing competition between publishers caused by reduced margins (buyer power)\nand saturated market (increasing substitutes) and proliferation of titles. Also no real\nbranding among publishers (who published the last book that you read?).\n- Increasing competition leading to higher advances to well known authors (millions of\ndollars in many cases).\nAdvanced answers from students might discuss what can be done to help the industry. For\nexample:\n- Become a market leader by announcing new terms and conditions for the large book\nretailers. If the other major players in the industry follow the lead, the industry may\nbecome more profitable as a whole. If not, the client may need to move back to the old\nterms in the industry.\n- Focus on the books or types of books that have an expected positive NPV. The\nproliferation of books probably has caused many unprofitable titles.\n- Forward integrate into bookstores.\n- Travel Travails: An Israeli travel agent has been extremely successful. His primary source of\nrevenue is customers who fly to and from the U.S. He manages to fill up over two planeloads\non a daily basis. Given his success, he is considering buying an aircraft and flying the U.S.-\nTel Aviv route himself. What advice would you give him?\n- Find the source of your client’s success. In this case he is attracting customers due to\nhis own promotion and reputation. He will probably continue to do so if he buys his\nown aircraft.\n- Assess your client’s complete understanding of the industry and venture he is\nconsidering. He should clarify issues such as hub space availability, international air\ntraffic regulations, and other specifics of the industry.\n- Assess your client’s capital resources. Does he have the funds to support this\nventure?\n- Analyze the current state of this segment of the airline market. As a travel agent, he\nknows the pulse of the consumer fairly well. Is the market in a growth trend? Who\nare the dominant competitors and what would you anticipate their reaction to be? If\nthe route is very busy, it is probably very lucrative for other airlines.\n- Competitor’s reaction: The major operator happens to be El Al which has deep\npockets. If your client enters the industry he would probably trigger a price war. If\nnot, other small operators would follow and El Al would begin to lose an important\nsource of profits.\n\n- The only way your client could fight this war would be to differentiate himself from\nEl Al and the other airlines by charging a lower price. However, El Al would match\nany such move and your client would be forced out of business.\n- Seems the best recommendation would be not to enter the market as a small operator.\n- Baby Airline: How would you compare the airline industry with the baby food industry? In\nwhich would you invest your own money?\n- The industries could be compared by going through some version of Porter’s Five\nForces or 3 C’s analysis. Consider the following:\n- Markets to determine current drivers of success or change\n- Overall profitability trend\n- Nature of the competition\n- Control of suppliers and distributors\n- Existence of substitutes\n- Customers and how they are segmented and what are their preferences\n- Competition in the airline industry is intense.\n- Fixed costs are high and competitors keep cutting prices which results in low profit\nmargins.\n- Microeconomic arguments indicate that airlines will keep cutting prices as long as they\nare covering variable costs. Since fixed costs are high and undoubtedly financed with\ndebt, these companies can end up defaulting on interest payments.\n- Customers are segmented into price inelastic business travelers and very price sensitive\nleisure travelers.\n- Brand equity and loyalty are relatively low.\n- On the other hand, the baby food industry is less competitive.\n- There are only two or three large players who do not indulge in cutthroat pricing; thus,\nmargins are higher than in the airline industry.\n- Products are well-differentiated with customers being quality conscious and willing to\npay a premium for quality.\n- Brand loyalty is high.\n- As an investment decision, the baby food industry is better than the airlines due to\nhigher profit potential.\n- Acquisition Target: A turnaround specialist has retained your services to help her evaluate a\nmedium-sized lumber company as a potential acquisition. How would you determine whether\nthe acquisition was worthwhile?\n- First ask what are her specific motives for acquiring the company? For example, is she\nlooking to sell off pieces of a failing company to competitors who could run it better or\nis she looking for a well-run, profitable business to run?\n- Because most of the company’s products are sold to the construction industry, it faces\ncyclical demand.\n- Most of the company’s production facilities are fully depreciated and somewhat\nantiquated.\n- Some reduction in the workforce will be necessary to achieve levels of efficiency on\npar with the best in the industry.\n- The company has extensive holdings of forests with a historical ROI for these assets of\n16%. However, this is less than the company’s cost of capital of 18%. If the company\n\nwere acquired, some of the acreage of forests could be sold to 1) provide cash to fund\ncapital improvements and 2) improve ROA.\n- The potential exists to appease environmentalists and improve operating efficiencies by\nincreasing selectivity in tree cutting and upgrading the process machinery to peel trees\nmore efficiently.\n- Conclusion: Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to acquire the company should\nbe based on a conservative assessment of 1) market potential 2) the potential to\nimprove the company’s operations, and 3) predicted competitor’s reaction. (Perform a\nmarket, company, customer, and competitor analysis). Because of the cyclical nature\nof the industry, it is important to examine the downside and upside scenarios. Sales\nbelow projections will be a problem, but sales growth higher than expected may also be\na problem if the company is short on working capital and operating at full capacity.\n- Micro Subsidiary: A large microelectronics company is considering participating in a\nmicrochip project that will receive 50% of its funding from the government. The company\ncurrently uses millions of dollars worth of microelectronics each year with the cost steadily\nincreasing. Although the company already has a small microchip subsidiary, its capacity is\nsmall and technology is relatively old. It is interested in developing application specific\nintegrated circuits (ASICs).\nWhat are the key considerations to making this decision? What factors are important for\nsuccess in the ASIC business? Should the company get involved and with whom?\n- What is an ASIC, when are they used, and what are they used for? An ASIC combines\nthe functions of many semiconductor components on one chip, decreasing the size and\nweight and increasing speed and reliability. Assembly costs are reduced, but\ndevelopment costs are higher.\n- What is the market outlook for the product (ASIC)? High growth, currently about 15%\nof integrated circuits are ASICs and this figure is expected to rise to 35% in the next 10\nyears.\n- Who are the major customers and what are the drivers of their preferences? Two key\ncustomer segments are entertainment electronics and automotive applications.\n- How is the industry structured, how competitive is it? There are about 150 firms\nproducing ASICs of which only a handful are of any substantial size.\n- Who are the key competitors and what are their main business lines? There is\ncurrently only one producer of ASICs in a similar line of business but this competitor\nhas much more sophisticated production capabilities.\n- Would it be cheaper or is it possible to outsource this production?\n- Are there already joint ventures or strategic alliances that exist? Some strong\nalliances exist in the industry and the possibility of converting old production facilities\ninto ASIC facilities may lead to great over-capacity or market saturation when the next\ngeneration of chips takes over.\n- What is the product life cycle of the ASIC?\n- Are there significant barriers to entry? What are the expected costs of entry? A state\nof the art production facility large enough to meet the company’s needs would cost\naround $250 million. In addition, considerable effort would be required to find the\nstaff with suitable expertise. Also, firms whose core business was semiconductors\nwould have significant technology and R&D advantages.\n\n- How is the ASIC business different from that of standard integrated circuits with\nregards to production volumes and fixed and variable cost? Typical ASIC production\nvolumes are much lower so there exists a need to find some way to reduce costs.\nExplore the possibilities of shorter production/design cycles and interchangeable parts.\n- What are your client’s current purchasing habits? Currently purchases nearly all of its\nmicroelectronics through one subcontractor who delivers high value.\n- Do potential joint venture partners exist?\n- Top Dog: You have been hired by a food processing company that recently introduced a new\nhot dog to the market. Sales in the first two weeks have far exceeded the marketing\ndepartment’s projections. Your client thinks he may need to add more capacity. What advice\nwould you give him?\nThe following are relevant questions about the product and market you should want to ask\nyour client regarding consumer’s buying preferences, competitive break-up, sales and\npromotions, etc.\n- Is your hot dog product significantly different from others on the market? (fat free,\ncheese filled, etc). In this case, the answer is NO.\n- Does your product appeal to a specific market niche that others do not? (kosher, sports\nfans, specific ethnic recipe, etc). In this case, the answer is NO.\n- Is your hotdog product priced significantly lower than other products out there? In this\ncase, the answer is NO.\n- Have you been offering grocers and distributors a special introductory price? In this\ncase, the answer is YES.\nIt appears that the client’s initial sales surge has been influenced by one-time buyers\nattracted to the low price promotion. Follow-up questions might include:\n- How often do most grocers re-order hot dogs? In this case, 2 times/week\n- Has your client received any re-orders? In this case, the answer is NO.\nAt this point you should ask your client to re-evaluate his projections. Hot dogs are\nsomewhat of a commodity product that compete primarily on price. There are numerous\nwell-established firms in the industry with no one firm holding a large market share.\n- Grocery List: A regional chain of grocery stores currently receives its stock on a decentralized\nbasis; i.e., each store deals directly with the various suppliers. The president of the chain is\nwondering whether it would be better if they established a centralized warehouse through\nwhich all supplies would be delivered and then disbursed by company trucks. What are the\nkey considerations to make in this decision?\nFor this case, you need to perform a hard (financial) and soft (impact on organizational\neffectiveness) analysis of this decision.\n- Financial: You need to determine if the savings from bulk purchasing would more than\ncompensate for the cost of:\n- Building and maintaining the warehouse\n- Employing additional personnel and trucks\n- Capital tied up in inventory for the additional period\n- Do the stores buy similar products (i.e., do purchasing synergies exist)?\n- Will delivery frequency to the stores be better or worse? Consider the costs of stockout\nand the need for fresh produce.\n\n- Will the stores prefer delivery direct from the supplier or from the warehouse?\nConsider the time tied up in order processing and the flexibility of delivery times and\nquantities.\n- Have any of your competitors experimented with such operations and were the results\nsuccessful?\n- What impact will this switch have on your alliances/relationships with your suppliers?\nWill all of your employees support this decision given some potential long-standing\nrelationships with suppliers?\n- Will orders still be placed individually with payments done in a centralized office\nlocation?\nYour solution will depend upon your interpretation of the financial and organizational\ntrade-offs inherent in the two methods of delivery. To propose going to the new method,\nyou need to establish not only that it will cost less, but also that all of the affected players\ncan be persuaded to buy into it.\n- Sweet Money: Aspartame is an artificial sweetener and the key ingredient in Nutra Sweet.\nFor years Nutra Sweet had a monopoly in the artificial sweetener business, but in 1992 it was\nchallenged by the Holland Sugar Company (HSC) in Europe. In 1994, HSC announced that it\nwould compete with Nutra Sweet in the U.S. as well. Coke and Pepsi, the two principal\nbuyers of Aspartame, immediately announced that they would buy from both HSC and Nutra\nSweet. HSC took the Cola companies at their word and built an expensive plant in\npreparation to sell in the U.S. Yet the HSC sales never materialized – Coke and Pepsi both\nsigned multi-year contracts with Nutra-Sweet. Why did they do this? What should HSC have\ndone differently?\n- Coke and Pepsi had a dependable source of Aspartame at unchanging prices for many\nyears.\n- Coke and Pepsi used the two suppliers against each other. The threat of HSC made\nNutra Sweet offer multi-year deals to these two buyers at very low prices.\n- HSC was shut out because it did not obtain a specific written contract/order from both\nCoke and Pepsi guaranteeing purchase orders before it built its plant. Now its only\nhope for survival is to either identify other potential buyers of Aspartame to cover their\nfixed costs or try to sell off their facility to Nutra Sweet or some other willing buyer.\nHSC can also entertain the thought of pursuing legal recourse on Pepsi and Coke for\ndamages.\n- Airline Route Expansion: A major American airline is considering establishing new routes\nfrom Tokyo to several sites in the United States. Would you recommend this action to your\nclient?\n- This case is different from the NY-Tokyo airline question because it deals with\nestablishing new routes as opposed to acquiring existing ones.\n- As always, determine your client’s motive for this business decision. What is your\nclient’s ability to fund this decision and how does it fit into his/her overall firm\nstrategy?\n- This case requires a complete examination of the customers and the competition.\nYou need to assess if there is a demand for these routes to support your decision and\nwhat carriers already exist in these markets and how they are operating.\n- Customers consist of both business and leisure travelers. While business travel from\nJapan to the U.S. has been declining at about 25% over the last year, leisure travel has\n\nincreased at a faster rate. It is expected that leisure travelers will continue to grow at\na faster rate than business travelers do. Currently, about 50% of all Japanese travelers\nto the U.S. are leisure travelers.\n- Examine what the market is like and if this trend is sustainable in the short and long\nterm. Can the market withstand another entrant? Identify any anti-trust or regulatory\nstatutes that would impede the establishment of these routes. What issues need to be\nconsidered in the Japanese market/government?\n- Look at what competition presently exists in these markets and what competitor\nreactions will be.\n- As it turns out, it is extremely expensive to buy gates at Tokyo’s crowded airport. As\na result, competition will not only come from other airlines at Tokyo airport, but also\nfrom a new airport that is being built in Osaka.\n- Furthermore, Osaka is expected to attract a very high percentage of the leisure\ntravelers. It is very inconvenient for leisure travelers to fly out of Tokyo, where the\nprices tend to be higher. It is estimated that once the Osaka airport is built, leisure\ntravelers at Tokyo could decrease by 25-30%.\n- If your client continues with his/her plans to buy gates in Tokyo, s/he will find it\ndifficult to attract the growing number of leisure travelers needed for their new routes\nto the U.S. It probably makes more sense to buy gates in Osaka instead.\n- Another insight is the recognition that Osaka will increase the number of airport gates\nin Japan. The intense demand for gates in Tokyo will decrease with the greater\nsupply of gates in Osaka. While this does not change the benefits of buying gates in\nOsaka, it may create new, cheaper opportunities to buy gate space in Tokyo in the\nfuture to establish new business traveler routes to the U.S.\n- Once you have a good idea of what the demand will be like, analyze the various cost\ncomponents of this business decision to determine whether or not you will have\nenough revenue to cover your cost in both the short and long terms and what your\nmargins will be like.\n- Role playing (Deloitte): You are a consultant asked to visit a client and identify the problem\nby asking questions. Afterwards, we will pretend that you are back at the Deloitte office and\nreporting to the senior managers regarding what you found and your recommendations.\nCase Question: Your client is a manufacturer of plumbing products and is not making\nmoney. Why? (Declining Profitability Question)\nHard to say of course, but the framework is Revenue minus Costs.\nSome information given to me: many competitors, low margin business, but your firm is\ndoing worse,\nLooking for:\n- the fact there are 3000 products and 200 product lines.\n- the fact that in the manufacturing process, it takes a long time to switch from one\nproduct line to another\n- the fact the finance did a study that 600 products are sold for under cost\n- the fact that canceling lines would upset distributors (who are external but exclusive)\nwho want whole lines\n- the fact the it critical to understand what is profitable by accounting standards versus\nhurdle rate standards\n\n- Starman (Deloitte): You have been asked by the CEO of Starman, a heavy construction\nequipment manufacturer, to help them with some short and long term business issues. The\nshort term goal is to increase profits, which they have seen steadily erode. Their long term\ngoal is to remain a viable player in a competitive industry. Here are some facts that are given\nto you:\nStarman is #1 of 3 of the largest manufacturers in the US. However, the other 2\ncompetitors have grown faster than Starman has in the last 10 years. The industry is $15\nBB and is seeing a CAGR of 7%.-Demand for Starmans's products has seen steady growth\nin the last 25 years at about 5-10% per year. Currently, Starman has 12% market share.\n(Deloitte Consulting, Winter 1999, for summer associate position)\nApproach I took:\n- I broke it down in terms of short and long term needs. I spent a good 25 minutes\ngathering information regarding the items affecting profitability (i.e.: revenue and\ncosts) and the positioning of the company to its customers relative to the competition. I\nalso asked questions regarding the value chain and where Starman has relative\nstrengths and weaknesses versus the competition.\n- There seemed to be many places one could go with this case (i.e., I discovered that\nStarman was not as integrated with their suppliers as their competition and that they\nhad operating expenses that drove up their variable costs. As a result, their operating\ncosts were increasing at a greater rate than that of the competition).\n- It seemed that there were no right answers, as long as you listened carefully to the\n\"client\" and asked intelligent, logical questions that allowed you to structure the\nproblem to identify root causes. From the problem identification, you could then make\nsome recommendations regarding what additional information is needed and/or what\ncorrective measures might be considered.\n- Music Magic (BCG): Two large entertainment (specifically music) conglomerates merge.\nEach own real estate. Total assets worth 900 million dollars. How does one deal with the real\nestate function within the new firm (integration). The overarching objective is to save money\nnow!\nSome points:\nConsolidation: pretty basic points on duplicate needs, fixed costs, etc.\nKey: Return on assets. Do they have good return on assets and what do they do with\nthem?\nHis point, the WACOC for a firm is high because it is volatile and but low for lease\nbecause it is stable, so in most cases, sell the land and lease long term to use the capital for\nbetter use.\nBoth firms do similar work, one is headquartered in the US and one in the Netherlands are\nhas a presence in many other countries. Local presence is important - start by looking at\nhow to integrate the headquarters.\nOptions:\n- keep both\n- close one location and keep another\n- close both and get a new one\nIssues to consider:\nstrategy - where is it important for them to have the most presence?\n\npeople - where is the management from, are they willing to relocate, what additional costs\nwould relocation result in?\nDo NPV analysis of the above 3 options.\n- Consumer Finance (BCG): Your client is the CEO of a consumer finance bank that\nspecializes in at-risk credit lending. In other words, lending to consumers who would have\ndifficulty obtaining loans elsewhere. Several years ago the bank diversified into mass\nmarketing credit cards. This division is losing revenue. Why? (BCG, Winter 1999, for\nsummer associate position)\n2 answers:\nTheir core competency is in lending to at-risk clients, not the mass\n-\nmarket. 60% of their profits are derived from 10% of the volume, at-risk customers.\nThey should focus on this market.\nRevenue is made of price and quantity. Price is free and quantity is\n-\ndependant upon their interest rate level. When you dig deeper, the bank has been\nlosing customers after introductory offers run out. There are no switching cost.\nDigging deeper, the bank is keeping their interest rate the same, while their competitors\nare lowering theirs.\n- SKU Jumble (PriceWaterhouse Coopers): Detailed operations case with 2.5 pages of text.\nLike a mini-version of a full Harvard business school case on operations. Talked about\nmanufacturing operations and supply chain issues and marketing issues such as demand\nforecasting, product mix/breadth of product lines. This particular case described a\nmanufacturer of fireplace inserts having problems relating manufacturing based on too many\nSKUs in the product mix, too many conflicting demands placed on the factory (quality vs.\nlead time vs. cost), too many non-value added operations in their order fulfillment process and\nan unclear management hierarchy which made it difficult to make and implement decisions.\nThe ideal answer to this case will also address the HR type issues involved, for example one\nof the plant foremen was very close to retiring and therefore reluctant to make big changes.\nFrameworks used: Basic financial ratios used in operations like COGS, fixed operating\nexpense ratio, var. manufacturing expense ratio, fixed assets ratio etc. Economic /\nbreakeven analysis, EOQ model from operations.\nGeneral Tips: Expect a longish case, part of their tactic in the interview situation is to\nmake you feel under pressure by saying \"don't worry about me\" after they give you case\nand then trying to distract you by looking at you at glaring at their watch etc. Idea is to\nmake you feel like there is so much work in front of you that you can't possible get it done\nin the 20 minutes they have defined for you. Best advice on this is to totally ignore the\ninterviewer once you have clarified the time limit for studying the mini-case and any\nquestions. Then try to read and get your presentation together in less time than what they\nsay you should take (ie, 18 minutes instead of 20).\n- Opera House: The Royal Opera Company has been facing declining profits over the past few\nyears. Why?\n- Has there been a drop in attendance? No, attendance has been fairly constant, and it\nmay have actually increased a little bit.\n- Have revenues declined? No.\n- I am assuming there has been an increase in costs. Have there been any major\nchanges in the cost drivers? Well, what do you think are the main costs?\n\n- Salaries (players and administrative personnel), fixed overhead. How would you\ndetermine where the cost problem is?\n- First, I would want to see if there is a change in the pattern of current vs. past\nspending. Second, I would want to benchmark the Royal Opera Company with other\nsimilar companies. Actually, the opera company has been trying to meet public\ndemand for variety by putting on more different shows per season.\n- I assume that there is a high fixed-cost with developing an opera rehearsal time, sets,\netc. and a relatively lower variable cost with each production? Yes…what would you\nsuggest?\n- The Royal Opera could cut costs by coordinating with their marketing department and\nidentifying the big demand shows and offer fewer operas per season. They might\nalso maintain their variety by sharing productions with other opera companies. So,\nthe Royal Opera could send some actors to, say, the Sydney Opera and get some\nactors in return for several productions.\n- Yes. But what if the actors don’t want to spend a great deal of time on the road?\nHow would you handle that issue?\nI present the travel as a prestigious opportunity to increase exposure on the international\ncircuit. If necessary, I would divide the company into traveling and permanent groups.\n- Big 6: You have been called in by a Big 6 accounting firm that is experiencing declining\nprofitability in its auditing operation. What actions would you take to help them improve\nprofitability?\n- First determine whether the industry itself is in a state of declining profits or if just\nyour client is losing money. If it is just your client, benchmark your client’s operations\nagainst the competition to see what they are doing more successfully to profit. In this\ncase, the entire industry is in a slump and competition is intense as firms fight to\nsurvive.\n- Remember profits are revenues minus costs. To improve profitability, your client\nneeds to either increase revenue or reduce costs.\n- Increasing revenues would require increasing volume or price.\n To increase volume, the client’s marketing and promotions department must\nidentify the current drivers of success in the industry. What do the customers or\npotential customers place a premium on (e.g., service, low-price, quality, reputation,\netc.)? Determine if your client is providing the type of services the customers.\nYour client could increase volume by cutting prices but that would require cutting\ncosts in order to sustain profitability.\n Raising prices would increase revenues but your client would have to differentiate\nitself significantly or use promotional incentives. It also must consider that\ncompetitor reactions will be strong and prompt given the present nature of the\nindustry.\n- Reducing costs requires examining the cost structure of the firm. Fixed costs are\noffices, equipment, and personnel. Variable costs are general consumables, travel, etc.\nIt turns out that the single largest component of costs is personnel. Reducing personnel\ncost would imply either cutting salaries, cutting staff, or raising staff productivity. The\nbest course of action is probably to try to increase productivity and resort to other\nalternatives later.\n\n- To increase staff productivity, the client could ask the staff to work longer hours (must\nprovide incentives).\n- The client could also review the layers of management in the firm to identify areas of\nexcess waste. For example, the partner-to-associate ratio may be optimized, which\nmay result in increased productivity per labor dollars.\n- Software Stumble: This case is about a system software house. Company Z develops\ncustomized applications for a large variety of customers in very different industries. Recently,\nhowever, top management has found out that the results of Company Z are well below\nindustry averages. You are brought in to diagnose the current situation, identify key issues,\nand recommend possible solutions to help bring the company to a higher level of profitability.\nThe following information should be made available in response to questions asked by the\ncandidate:\nLast year’s P&L (% of sales)\nRaw material 70%\nLabor 20%\nDistributed Overhead 10%\nSG&A 15%\nProfit -15%\nAlso, the raw material is a commodity petrochemical and at least two of the other\ncompanies in the industry are making moderate profits.\nAvoid getting bogged down in the following areas:\n- Dropping the product line – this is not possible because hoses are necessary for boiler\nsales\n- Raw material prices – they are the same as everyone else’s\n- Allocation of overhead – no cash savings and offers little potential\n- SG&A: standard industry fee paid for independent installers\nExamine the possibilities of:\n- Contracting out for the hoses – apparently not possible\n- Scale economies – client is big enough to achieve scale production\n- Labor costs – wage rates and productivity are average for the industry\n- Raw materials purchasing practices – materials are purchased through long term\ncontracts with the price based on the spot market minus a cash discount\nMore relevant questions:\n- How is our product engineering operation wired into the marketplace? – There is little\ncontact between the engineering and marketing organizations.\n- What kind of feedback are we receiving from our sales force? – Customers are\ndelighted with our hoses but don’t require all the product features.\n- Are there other areas in the company where similar problems exist?\nThe best answers, following a logical progression, should stumble upon the actual answer:\nthe product has been overdesigned, requiring excess raw material.\n\n- Mapping Measures: Your client, company C, sells maps to schools along with two other\nmajor companies. Company A sells its maps at a 10% premium and still maintains the\nhighest market share, while company B follows the same pricing structure as your client and\nhas captured the same market share as your client. What should your client, company C, do\nto increase its share and profitability?\nOverall issues:\n- Is there any product differentiation? No. Even company A’s products are similar to\nyour client’s.\n- Who is the customer? Principals and superintendents of schools.\n- Does company A offer any complimentary products? No\n- How are customers and orders handled? Salespeople visit customers and if some maps\nneed replacing, an order is placed.\n- Is there a difference in the size of sales forces? Yes, company A has a larger one.\n- What is the market area (local or national) and how many schools are in the market?\nHere, the interviewee is asked to estimate the number. Start with population, move to\nnumber of people who are “school age” and then estimate the number of schools.\nStrategic Issues:\n- To increase market share and/or profitability, you need to increase revenues or\ndecrease costs.\n- To increase revenues, explore the demand function to see how to increase sales. What\ndrives your customer’s preferences? Is there any brand loyalty or are the maps\ncommodity items?\n- To take sales and market share away from Company A, consider lowering prices,\nincreasing the sales force, increasing promotional efforts, etc. One solution might be to\nset-up a toll-free number for customers to call in orders (keep in mind the potential\neffect on the sales force). Promotional efforts could include sending price schedules to\ncustomers stating lower prices compared to competitors.\n- Another way to increase revenues is to increase prices, but that would require\ndemonstrating why your product is significantly superior to justify the premium. This\nis not a good approach given the undifferentiated nature of the product.\n- Finally, compare your cost structure to your competitors and explore ways to lower\nyour fixed and variable costs, etc.\n- News Dues: You have been hired by a newspaper publisher who has been experiencing\ndeclining readership and, as a result, declining profitability. What would you suggest she do?\n- First, if readership (demand for your product) is declining, you should determine\nwhether your competitors are experiencing the same problem (is it an industry-wide\nconcern or is it particular to the client). In this case, it turns out that all publishers\nshare the same problem and that television is the main culprit.\n- To address this issue your client could do two things:\n- Study other markets where television is prevalent but newspaper readership is\nhigh (like Japan) and use any knowledge you can gain to promote readership in\nthe U.S. Your client could share costs via newspaper publisher associations.\n- Explore the possibilities of phasing out of the newspaper industry and entering\nthe television industry. This is highly improbable given the high costs of entry\n\nbut you could explore any competitive advantages you could leverage to that\nindustry and the opportunity of a joint venture with an existing TV company.\n- Second, if readership is down in the industry and your client still believes it can be\nprofitable to stay in the industry, you need to utilize the marketing department to\naccurately determine customer preferences and tailor contents to them. Remember that\nany differentiation that is imitable will be quickly neutralized by competitors.\n- Third, examine your different geographic market segments to see if margins and\ndemand differs greatly. If there are markets that are clearly still prospering, maybe\nyour client could focus target readership efforts to these more profitable areas.\n- Fourth, build mechanisms to continually adapt to changing reader tastes. This could be\naccomplished by market studies, flexible and versatile staffs, etc.\n- Fifth, your client could focus on cost reduction as a means of increasing profitability.\nPossibilities include consolidating operations and/or reengineering them.\nConsolidation would help in deriving economies of scale whereas re-engineering could\nidentify and eliminate operational inefficiencies. Issues such as low capacity levels,\nchanging input prices, and distribution and labor shift costs should all be explored.\nLower cost could also lead to lower prices, which may stimulate demand.\n- Building Brouhaha: Your client manufactures and sells 11 different building products such as\nconcrete, lumber, and bricks, and is profitable but has been losing market share over the past\nfew years. The company is presently second or third in the industry. What information\nwould you need to gather to assess your client’s problem and what recommendations would\nyou make? Note: In the real interview, you spend the first 20 minutes acting like you are\ndiscussing the problem with your client and then the last 20 minutes back at the office\ndebriefing your manager.\nThe following are some of the questions you might want to inquire about.\n- What is the present state of the construction material market? Pretty good, the industry\nfollows economic cycles and it is presently in an upswing.\n- Who are the company’s customers? Two different types of customers, large general\ncontractors and little shops.\n- What are the company’s strengths or core competencies? The company competes on\ncost and high quality. It supposedly has a strong sales force and reputation for\nproviding the best quality products.\n- If market share is falling, does that mean sales have been falling? I don’t know - here\nis all of our sales data manually entered on paper and stuffed into all these boxes.\n(This is one of their first hints as to part of the problem. It turns out that none of their\nsales recording systems and possibly accounting systems in general are automated)\n- What is the management and corporate structure like? A new CEO came in a few\nyears ago and presently all 11 divisions are operating as separate business entities.\nManagers in each business unit are compensated on how profitable they are. (Second\nhint, your client needs to consolidate its operations.)\n- What is the company’s present capacity level? Presently have excess capacity.\n- If sales are down, what does this outstanding sales force of yours know about how your\ncustomer’s preferences have changed? It appears there is a trend towards regional\nsuperstores that provide a variety of items with one-stop shopping. Your smaller\ncompetitors can compete better on this regional basis with better geographic\n\naccessibility. It seems your competitors are meeting the customers changing needs but\nyour client is not. The customers complain about poor service – your client is getting\nlazy and complacent. (Third hint, your marketing people should know the pulse of the\ncustomer and it appears they do not.)\n- Have your cost increased overtime? I did a value chain analysis and after dragging me\nout for awhile, they finally conceded that there were no significant changes in either\nfixed or variable costs.\nConclusion/Recommendations:\n- Need to work on their sales and other accounting systems and make them automated\nand more accurate and efficient. They claim that sales are down yet they may not be\nable to accurately quantify by how much or in which regions of their market.\n- Need to consolidate the companies operations and create greater synergy among the 11\ndifferent business units. This way they can leverage each other’s skills and have all of\nthe managers’ goals aligned. People would also be less myopic in the way they run\ntheir divisions and this may resolve some of their capacity problems. Possibly suggest\na different compensation policy that rewards all managers if the firm’s overall bottom\nline increases.\n- Get marketing people to talk with the customer, suppliers, distributors, etc. to\nunderstand the recent trends in consumer preferences. Then get marketing people to\ncoordinate with manufacturing and distribution people to put changes in marketing\nplan into action.\n- Daft Drugs: A pharmaceutical manufacturing company has a problem. While it has what it\nbelieves are superior products and good distribution channels, its rivals consistently have a\nlarger market share. For the past two years, the CEO of this company has spent three times\nthe industry average on advertising. There has been blanket coverage on newspaper and\ntelevision. Market research reveals that consumers show name recognition for most of the\nadvertised products and the campaign is more successful than hoped; yet sales remain slow.\nYou have been hired as a consultant to rectify the situation. How would you approach it?\n- This is a marketing case. Lead the candidate through analysis of the customer\nsegments. Questions such as who are the primary and secondary customers of your\npharmaceutical client.\n- The fact is that most pharmaceuticals are purchased by doctors and not by the general\npublic. However, the company’s advertising focuses on radio and TV, targeting the\ngeneral population.\n- The company would be better off spending its advertising resources in journals that\nspecifically target medical practitioners, for example.\n- Airplane Assay: You are a consultant to the CEO of an airplane manufacturer. In the last\ncouple of years you have gone from being number one in market share to number two. In\naddition, another company has announced that it will be entering the business and is presently\ntooling up its plan. As a consultant, what are the concerns your client might face, what\nadditional information might you want, and what recommendations would you have?\nAs a consultant, you are concerned with three items:\n- The state of the airplane manufacturing industry (the market)\n- The reason the firm has lost market share\n- Methods for preventing the new entrant from stealing market share\n\n1) The airplane industry’s demand is a function of travel among two classes: business and\nleisure. Business travel increases as a result of globalization. Leisure travel increases\nwith growth of middle and upper classes. Business travelers are primarily insensitive\nto price; leisure travelers are very price sensitive. The consultant should ask if there\nare any regulatory, economic, or other factors that may be drivers of future change in\nthis industry.\n2) If your client is losing market share, either the industry itself is shrinking (in this case it\nis not) or your client is losing sales to its competitors. You need to ask why they are\nlosing sales – maybe their costs and/or prices are increasing compared to their\ncompetitors. Find out what are the drivers of success in this industry (i.e., what do the\ncustomers place a premium on: price, safety, brand equity, quality, etc.?)\nBenchmark against existing competitors:\nIt turns out that the competitor’s plane is cheaper to operate because it is more fuel-\nefficient. The consultant should ask whether the firm is interested in manufacturing\nmore fuel-efficient planes. The answer would depend on the future of oil prices. It\nmay be better to compete on the basis of price, safety and service.\n3) Methods for preventing the new entrant from stealing market share:\n- Create barriers to entry such as low prices, control of resources, technology patents,\nlocked-up distribution channels\n- Establish long-term contracts or strategic alliances with both customers and\nsuppliers\n- Exploit high concern of purchasers for proven safety track records\n- Threaten to use excess capacity\n- Electronic Trouble: You have been hired by a large electronics manufacturing company\nbecause it has been getting continual complaints from its customers about late delivery of\nproducts. How would you research the problem and what would you recommend?\n- It turns out your client presently does most of its business in the U.S. and Canada with\nminor international customers.\n- Your client has just made a huge capital investment by creating its main manufacturing\nfacility in China and management is forced to stand by this investment decision. China\nwas chosen (vs. the U.S.) because of lower labor costs.\n- When you examine their operational process, it turns out most of their processes are\nmachine automated anyway.\n- Distribution channels/outbound logistics: It turns out your client transports its finished\ngoods to the U.S. via ship as opposed to air freight or other means. This trip across the\nPacific takes a minimum of 5 weeks. (So your client has deliberately added 5 weeks to\nits lead-time to save on labor cost although most of the operational processes are\nautomated anyway!)\n- Solution: Explore other quicker means of getting the product to your customers. With\nregards to the large plant investment that management is forced to support, you have a\nfew options. Explore new opportunities in the Asian market to take advantage of the\nplant’s proximity. Also, if your client has the funding and is sure of the domestic\ndemand, it should build a smaller plant in the U.S. to react quicker to U.S. customer\nneeds. If your client does not have the financial backing, it should look into the\n\npossibility of outsourcing some of the domestic manufacturing processes to\nindependent contractors.\n- When you analyze the customer’s preferences, it turns out that there is a demand for\nonly about 25 of your client’s products in the marketplace. A review of your client’s\ncurrent product line reveals they are producing over 1000 different electronic products.\n- All of the additional set-up times, machine run specifications, packaging and\ndistribution of this over-extended product line is extremely costly in the absence of\nconsumer demand.\n- Solution: Make sure the manufacturing people are communicating with the marketing\ndepartment so your client produces what the customer wants or needs. You should\nrecommend that your client significantly scale down its product line.\n- Ill-equipped Equipment-maker: A medical equipment manufacturer in the southeastern U.S.\nhas called you because it feels its working capital requirements are much higher than those of\nits competitors are. As a consultant, how would you help solve your client’s problem?\n- Start off by going through the list of items that may be increasing your client’s working\ncapital. (Recall from accounting that working capital is your current assets and\nincludes things such as cash, marketable securities, receivable, and inventory). In this\ncase, you will discover that your client’s inventory levels are inordinately high.\n- The client’s organization is made up of three divisions. The inventory problem can be\ntraced to a division that was acquired by the client two years ago. This division\nmanufactures equipment for arthoscopic surgery, namely capital equipment and blades\n(something like razors and razor blades, only more expensive).\n- It turns out the technology for this equipment has been changing rapidly and the rate of\nobsolescence of inventory is very high. Earlier sales forecasts had been overly\noptimistic and the client finds itself loaded with obsolete finished goods inventory.\n- As a corrective action, decide on the appropriate level of inventory by adjusting\nforecasts, getting an idea of manufacturing lead times, and determining customer\nexpectations of order lead times.\n- After appropriate levels of inventory are determined, it turns out that the client has 2.5\nyears of capital equipment inventory that it does NOT need to carry since these items\ncan be quickly manufactured after receiving the order. To help take this finished goods\ninventory off the books, finished goods could be dismantled and sold. Also, idled\nmanufacturing capacity could be adapted to make other goods if the facilities are\nflexible enough.\n- Credit Union Problems: You are a consultant whose services have been retained by a credit\nunion that serves an army base and a number of rural communities in Montana. This business\nhas been around for a long time. Its profits have been declining and it is losing market share\nto several new competitors. The credit union has a main office and 5 branches. You are\nbeing briefed that day at 9:00 a.m. by the President, who tells you that you will have a\nmeeting with the CEO at 3pm to tell him the things you would look at. The President also\ntells you that he is planning to quit. What things would you want to know in order to quickly\ndetermine the problem areas in the company?\nThis question requires that you quickly find out what the important problem areas are for\nthe credit union. Ask good, probing questions and move on if it is apparent that this is not\na problem area.\n\nThings to ask and tell the interviewer:\n- Was this company profitable before?\n- When did profits and market share begin declining?\n- If profits are declining, are your costs increasing or is your revenue/demand decreasing\nor are you experiencing a combination of both?\n- Benchmark against how your competitors are doing.\n- Find out what factors make them successful, for example, when did they come into the\nmarket? Are they doing anything differently that they weren’t doing before?\n- Are there any new regulations that may have been introduced in the state of Montana\nthat may have changed the way that credit unions must be run?\n- How are the various branches performing? (You want to find out whether the whole\ncompany is doing poorly or just selected areas.)\n- Does your client know who his customers really are and what they place a premium on\n(service, accessibility, cost, etc.)?\nThe problems with this company ended up being:\n- First, the company had an extremely old cost accounting system that prevented them\nfrom knowing what their true costs were.\n- Second, operations were a complete mess – in particular, they had high overhead costs\nwith respect to their competition. They need to find ways to cut costs.\n- Staffing levels were too high; they also took much longer to process a loan than any\nother credit union.\n- Customer service was a disaster and, as a result, they were losing customers to their\ncompetitors.\n- Cosmetic Strategy: Eurocos, Inc. produces and sells various cosmetic products in several\nEuropean countries. The company’s different brands are well established in the markets. The\nvarious products are quite similar in terms of raw materials and production. The company has\nbeen doing very well in the past; however, profits have been shrinking in recent years. The\nCEO of Eurocos, Inc. thinks of changing his strategy in the industry. He asks you if this is a\ngood idea and what he should do.\n- Again, if profits are decreasing, either costs are increasing or revenue/demand is\nshrinking or a combination of both.\n- Market: Industry has many small to medium size companies with few large firms\nowning several brands. There are many small to medium size brands.\n- Eurocos produces all products in all countries and transportation costs are small.\n- The structure of the industry is fragmented because there are low entry barriers, high\nproduct differentiation, diverse markets and customer needs, and tariffs and customs\nbarriers.\n- How can fragmentation be overcome: Create economies of scale to lower costs and\nmove up learning curves. Separate product’s commodity aspect from fragmenting\naspect.\n- Lower costs: consolidate production process to keep manufacturing cost low. This will\nwork because there will be economies of scale in production due to better sourcing,\nlonger runs, and better quality.\n\n- Increase revenue/demand: Keep the marketing and branding decentralized to the\ndifferent countries where they know the pulse of the consumers in each market.\nAdditionally, have the marketing department communicating with manufacturing to\nmake sure that there is still sufficient demand in separate markets to justify the wide\nproduct lines.\n- Company will move down the learning curve. Also, company will keep the\n“fragmented” marketing required in the market. Total inventory will decrease – safety\nstock at original plant locations can be pooled centrally to further lower costs.\n- Synthetic Mix: A client produces a range of synthetic materials in varying widths and lengths.\nEach material is used for packaging but differs in physical properties in terms of costs, weight,\nflexibility, and general performance. Each material can be coated with any one of four or five\ntypes of chemical coating which make the materials more or less impervious to heat, light,\nwater, vapor, etc. All of the machines on which these materials are made are housed in one\nenormous factory location. Each machine is capable of running any one of the various\nmaterials and/or coating combinations. The client does not wish to invest in additional\nequipment at this time. The client has asked us what combination of products he should run\nto increase his plant’s profitability. How would you go about determining the optimal mix of\npotential products on these machines?\n- Market share: The industry is highly fragmented. A variety of small manufacturers\nsupply similar products to a wide range of customers. Your client estimates she has\nless than 1 percent of the total market. No competitor has more than 3 percent of the\ntotal market.\n- Cost: Each product has a different manufacturing cost depending on materials used and\nthe manufacturing process.\n- Price: Each product has a different price depending on both the client’s manufacturing\ncost and the market for the product.\n- Essentially, if you are examining profit potential you want to find the best product mix\nof revenues (customer demand) and cost (supply).\n- Revenues: Your client’s products seem to be commodities given there seems to be no\nindustry leader. Thus, the marketing department should determine what products have\nthe highest customer demand and identify what drives customer preferences: price,\nquality, etc. It sounds like there is little brand loyalty. Concentrate on the products\nthat will generate the highest revenue.\n- Costs: Your costs can fluctuate widely given different set-up and lead times plus the\nraw material and packaging costs. Determine if there are products that are costly\nrelative to their demand and should be dropped. Explore ways to consolidate\noperations, run times, etc. for a more flexible process. Ultimately, you want to have a\nfirm idea of the margins on each product. Margins combined with knowledge of\nconsumer preferences should drive the production mix. Also, take into consideration\ncapacity, resource, and other input constraints.\n- Delivery Pain: Your client is the largest package delivery service in Canada. During the past\n30 years, the firm has established a network that allows it to deliver packages to anywhere in\nCanada. Until last year, competition had been non-existent and profits were strong. Starting\na year ago, a new company began parcel pick-up and delivery to only three cities: Toronto,\nMontreal, and Vancouver. Although overall volume has declined by only 10% for your client,\nprofits have decreased by an alarming 30%.\n\nOutline your hypothesis for this decline in profitability. Explain what analytic measures\nyou would use to diagnose this problem and where you would gather the necessary data.\nWhat suggestions would you recommend to your client to restore profitability and prevent\nthis from happening further?\n- The new entrant has a fleet of older trucks that run between the three cities. Your\nclient has a new fleet that services all of Canada. Your client’s fleet mix has been\noptimized such that efficiency and capacity utilization are high considering the network\nof locations.\n- The new entrant charges 50% less than your client for package delivery.\n- Your client and the new entrant both charge by the pound-mile. One pound carried one\nmile is a pound-mile.\n- This case is about the cost-benefit analysis of serving the entire market or just its most\nprofitable segments. The new entrant has initiated service in the three markets where\neconomies of scale are present. Due to the higher volume of packages between these\ncities, larger trucks and efficient distribution centers have made such limited service\nmore profitable.\n- How to reach or explain this conclusion: Use historical sales and expense data (or a\ncost measure such as pound-mile) to show that major city routes have subsidized\ndelivery to smaller cities and towns.\n- Compare the margins of customers in different rural and urban locations to see if\ndelivery to these inconvenient locations justifies the additional expense of the service.\nIf not, consider the possibilities of what to do with these customers.\n- Explore ways to maintain your urban customer base by either lowering operation costs\nand thus prices or rewarding loyal city customers with discounts or other promotions.\n- Recognize that this delivery service to all of Canada is a source of competitive\nadvantage to your client and those businesses that ship to these areas cannot afford to\nlose this service.\n- Employ strategies to exploit this competitive advantage given the absence of\nsubstitutes and the price inelasticity of this segment of the market. Determine a new\npricing strategy that will increase charges for rural deliveries. Note that this may invite\nnew entrants if rural delivery becomes very profitable.\n- Develop long-term strategic alliances/contracts with customers who use your rural\ndelivery capability. Offer the same flat rate only when a customer agrees to use your\nclient for both rural and city deliveries.\n- Search for synergies with other companies that also deliver to rural areas such as\ngrocery, beverage, or snack delivery companies.\n- Astro-demand: Your client has developed a new kind of astro-turf that they claim is far better\nthan any other existing products. You have been hired to estimate demand per year for the\nnext three years in actual number of square feet of astro-turf. After 3 years the client’s patent\nruns out and new competitors will introduce similar products.\nIn estimating market demand one methodology is the following: 1) Determine the overall\nmarket 2) Segment the market into different components 3) Try to determine the drivers of\ndemand in each segment of the market 4) Review/challenge your assumptions for market\ndemand for each segment.\n\nOverall Market: Could include professional sport teams, college athletics, and high school\nsports\nSegment the Market: Determine which sports would demand the new astro-turf: football\nbaseball, soccer, and lacrosse. Now make assumptions regarding the number of potential\ncustomers in each of these sports. Always pick round numbers for easy calculations.\n(Anytime you make assumptions about the market’s potential customer base, you can\nremind the interviewer that under normal circumstances, you would utilize a host of\nresource tools such as market research, industry data, sales and promotional feedback,\nclient focus groups, etc.)\nProfessional Teams: Number College Teams: Number\nBaseball 20 Football\nSoccer 15 Div. I schools 100\nLacrosse 12 Div I AA 50\nFootball 28 Div II 50\nDiv III 25\nSoccer (grass more popular) 75\nTotal 75 Total 300\nAssume all fields are the same size and require the same amount of material: 120 yd x 60\nyd or 7200 sq ft per field. Multiply 7200 by 375 fields to get the total potential market of\n2,700,000 sq yd. Now, speculate on how much of the total market you expect to penetrate\neach year considering how often stadiums change fields, what the recent trends are with\nrespect to natural grass, etc. Apply these percentages, e.g., 10-20%, to get yearly demands\nof 270,000-540,000 sq yd.\n- New York Banking: How would you determine whether a location in New York City holds\nenough banking demand to warrant opening a new branch?\n- Company: Your client needs to assess its motives for opening a new branch:\nprofitability, expansion into new markets, drive out existing competitors, etc. You\nmust examine how or if the new branch would complement your client’s existing\ncompetitive strengths and business strategy (retail or commercial, high growth or high\nprofitability) and what purpose the branch would serve. If your client is focused on\ndeposits and withdrawals only, an ATM may be sufficient.\n- Market: Examine the demographics of the area surrounding the prospective branch.\nPopulation, business concentration, income levels, etc. should be compared to those of\nhistorically successful branches. Is the area too saturated or can it sustain another\nbranch? What is the economic climate of that area – is it a growing business\ncommunity or are people and companies leaving the area?\n- Customers: Perform market research to determine the drivers of success in this area.\nWhat do potential customers place the highest premium on (e.g., cost, service,\naccessibility, etc.)? How do these qualities fit into your client’s business profile?\n- Competition: Anticipate what your competitors’ reactions to your client’s entry could\nbe. This would depend on the importance of the area to competitors in terms of profits,\n\nmarket share, diversity of business operations, etc. Your client will have to match\ncompetitor’s incentives to customers and should estimate these costs.\n- Knit Wit: How would you assess the world demand for knitting machines?\n- One method to look at this is to say the world demand for knitting machines is\ndependent upon the world demand for cloth. In order to evaluate the world demand for\ncloth, we need to know how much new cloth (in square meters) is being purchased per\nyear per number of people in the world.\n- In order to refine our number, we may segment the world population by level of\npersonal wealth.\n- Also consider these three factors in this question: 1) The current level of the ratio of\ncloth manufactured per year to the number of knitting machines. 2) The average useful\nlife of a knitting machine. 3) The existence of substitutes for knitting machines and\ntheir impact on knitting machine demand.\nAnother way to approach this question is to analyze the world market for knitting\nmachines. This would involve examining the following questions/issues:\n- Who is the world market (segmented by country, region, ethnicity, per capita income,\netc.)?\n- What does historical business data for the knitting industry tell us about world\ndemand? (This information may be found from industry sources, trade journals,\ngovernment agencies like Dept. of Agriculture and Commerce.)\n- Which people/countries make up the consumer demand for knitting machines? (Who\nare the customers?)\n- What companies are the major suppliers of knitting machines?\n- What are the drivers of change in this industry? Technology? If so, what new\ntechnological advances in equipment have made the knitting machine obsolete and how\nfast is this development spreading across the world markets?\n- Chinese Tea: How much tea is there in China?\nThe following is one of many approaches to answering this question. Ask the interviewer\nif s/he minds if you use pen and paper to assist in your calculation.\n- Assume you will give the answer in total number of tea bags in the country.\n- Start off by making some assumptions about population, imports versus exports, and\ntea storage.\n- Assume total population of China is 1 billion people.\n- Assume maybe that they export half as much as they have in the country at any given\ntime.\n- Assume that you are calculating the daily total and that the Chinese keep a weeks\nworth of tea at any given time (so multiply your total by 7).\n- Segment the total population into 3 age groups to calculate total consumption/amount.\nSay ages 0-20, 20-40, and 40 and above that constitute 400,400, and 200 million\npeople each.\n- Now make assumptions as to how many tea bags each group consumes a day, say 1, 3,\nand 3. This gives you a total daily consumption of 2.2 billion tea bags times 7 days a\nweek plus half that amount for exports for a grand total of 23.1 billion tea bags in\nChina on any given day.\n\n- Finally, your interviewer may ask you which of your assumptions you would challenge\nor question if you had more time for analysis.\n- Penny Shopping: You own a shopping mall. How many pennies are in it at any given time?\n- First, identify all possible sources of pennies: merchants (both registers and safes),\ngumball and other machines, public water fountains/wishing wells, banks, and change\non people.\n- Now make assumptions about each source.\n- Merchants and banks: Guess/assume how many stores, size of stores, number of cash\nregister and safes, and how many pennies in each.\n- Machines and fountains/wishing wells: assume how many there are and how many\npennies are in each.\n- People: assume how many are in the mall at any given time and guess how many\npennies they each have on themselves.\n- Add up the sub-totals to get your answer.\n- Chicago Shogun: Your rich uncle has died and left you a piece of prime real estate in\ndowntown Chicago. If you were building apartments on the property, how many stories high\nwould you build?\nThis is a financing decision case and is all about options, opportunity costs, and net present\nvalue. Questions and issues you should raise include:\n- Is there an existing building on the property or is it empty land?\n- Are there any liens or mortgages on the property?\n- Are there any factors that might threaten ownership or development?\n- The first decision is whether or not to build at all. It may be that you can make more\nmoney by simply keeping the land or by selling the property to someone else who\nvalues the property more than you do.\n- The second decision is whether to build apartments versus offices, homes, etc.\n- You would need to ask if the property is zoned for apartment buildings. Are there\nlimits on how high apartments in this area can be? What is the neighborhood like?\nAre there condos, apartments or slums?\nSolution: If you are indeed going to build apartment buildings and have freedom to make\nthem as high as you want, then the number of floors is a marginal revenue/marginal cost\nquestion. You build an additional floor if its marginal revenue is greater than its marginal\ncost.\n- American Car Owners (Mitchell Madison): What percent of the world’s cars are owned by\nAmericans?\nThe answer is between 30% and 35%. I assumed there are 100 million American\nhouseholds and each household has 2 cars. Therefore, 200 million cars are owned by\nAmericans. I then divided the rest of the world between developed and non-developed\nnations. There are 1 billion people in developed nations, and I assumed half had cars ->\n500 million cars. In the underdeveloped nations, I just guessed 100 million cars.\nTherefore, the percent of cars owned by Americans is 200/600 = .33\n- Probability Potpourri (Mitchell Madison): Part I: A has a probability of 1/2, and B has a\nprobability of 1/2, what is the probability of A and B?\nPart II: You are a contestant in Let’s make a deal. You select door #2. Monty Hall opens\ndoor #3 to reveal nothing behind it. Should you stay at door #2, or switch to door #1?\n\nPart I:\nFirst ask if it is independent, if so 1/4,\nIf A and B are correlated than the answer can be between 0 and 1/2.\nPart II:\nYou should switch to door #1. Door #1 offers a 2/3 chance for the prize, while Door #2\noffers a 1/3 chance. It is the same as giving you the choice of Door #2 or both Door #1\nand #3. You would select the latter.\n- Movie Man (Mitchell Madison): You own a movie theatre. Currently, you price movies at $8.\nNow, you want to divide your customers into 2 segments, recent movies and recent movies\nseen later. You will price these movies at $10 and $6. How would you assess the success of\nthis?\nThings to consider in answer: price elasticity of each segment, fact is, for first run theaters,\nyou pretty much have perfect competition, it is a commodity, so you would lose your entire\naudience. For the second run people, the price would actually be inelastic.\nNote, since movies are commodities, most of the money is in the concession, think about\ntotal volumes of people in the theater.\nAnother idea: if you do charge 10 dollars you must differentiate your product, large screen,\nor something.\nOne more idea:\nQuestion whether a third segment should be added (independent films).\n-\nAnalyze existing outlets that appeal to these segments.\n-\nRun regressions on results.\n-\n- Pay Day (Mitchell Madison): You are with the firm for one year, discussing with the partner\nthe compensation package for associates. What do you recommend?\nThis is tricky since I didn't know if my goal was to raise my salary or benefit the firm.\nSome issues discussed:\nCompetition: other consulting firms, banks, and start ups.\nWhat makes MMG different? Compensate accordingly think about non-pay compensation.\nAlternate idea:\nAlign Mitchell Madison values with incentives by implementing\n-\nmetrics.\nPerform competitive analysis (McKinsey, BCG, Bain, etc.) and\n-\ncustomer analysis (prospective new hires) to determine how to keep new\nhires.\n- Pulp and Paper (Mitchell Madison):A major USA pulp and paper player buys a competitor in\nEurope, which produces the same kind of products. These are tissue products, napkins,\nkitchen towels, etc. The problem is a decrease on ROA.\nOther info:\n- Business units are divided by country. Every country produces for his own market.\nThey act like kingdoms and have their own specifications for their country products.\nFor example, kitchen towels have small hills to give the sensation of volume (I cannot\nremember the technical name). Every country has different specifications for those hills.\nHave you ever noticed that different brands have different hills?, maybe not, unless you\nare very sensitive.\n\n- Although paper machines are working 98% of the time (they produce big rolls of\npaper), converting lines (produce retail rolls or napkins) are working 30% of the time.\nIs there a converting overcapacity?\n- Every do not want to change their specifications, because they think that customers\nwill notice the difference.\nThe merger has not produced the synergies that were expected. It is reasonable, for\nexample, to have the same kind of hills in all European products, and produce, for example,\nall kitchen towels in Germany and distribute to all the countries from there. In that case\nconverting machines will work much more than 30% of the time.\nThis will stop, for example, machines in France. In that case this machine can be sold and\nROA increase.\nThis change is better if the company switches to brand management instead of regional\nmanagement.\n- Health Insurance (Mitchell Madison):The California government passed legislation forming a\nprivate group to access health insurance for small business owners and their employees. They\nreceive $500m annually from the government and had a $5 million subsidized loan that they\nhad been paying back. In four years, their membership grew to 125,000, but the fifth year it\nonly grew to 130,000. The legislation also stated that any insurance company that signs a\ncontract with us must give us comparable rates as to big companies. The company had not\nincentivized their broker staff appropriately and had tried to sell direct - alienating them\nfurther. Brokerage fees also had a complex calculation. Should they become a private, not-\nfor-private company and disassociate with the government?\nInterviewer was concerned with the breakeven point of cove\nOther issues:\n- We have one other competitor who’s about 1/3 of our size; their rates are more\nexpensive but they are growing slightly faster (at least in the last year)\n- Most insurance companies are excited to go through us but the largest in the market is\nnot\n- We have 3% of the insured market but it seems unlikely that we can grow quickly\nbecause we have a high penetration in our target market and other small business\nowners do not have the cash flow—to grow customers we’ll likely have to wait until\nthose small businesses become mature\n- We have contracts with about 20 insurance companies (about 10-12 per region) but 2-3\nare our largest players in each region. This increases their power over us. If we move\naway from being associated with the government, they can and likely would increase\ntheir rates\n- The $500m subsidy is minimal compared to our bottom line\n- We’ll have to refinance the loan if we move away from the government and pay higher\ninterest but we’ve been prepaying the loan thus far\n- Members can choose insurance from any of the insurance companies that the group\nassociates with, even members within the same business—this is their strongest\ncompetitive advantage (CHOICE)\n- Clients paid them the pro-rata cost of the insurance, a broker commission, and an\nadministrative fee. The administrative fee was the primary source of revenue.\nThe interviewer was after two items: a) What is wrong with the company? b) Is the\ncompany viable as an independent non-profit company.\n\n- Incas and Business (PriceWaterhouse Coopers): In the 16th century, Francisco Pizzaro with\n168 men and 40 horses defeated a town of 80,000 Incas. Characteristics of the Incas:\n- they were rich, and they has mastered the art of making gold and handicrafts.\n- they had agriculture but no way of storing food for long\n- they regarded the king as a god.\n- there had recently been civil war among the Incas and the brother of the king had led\nan uprising against the king.\nDraw parallels between this historical incident and modern corporations in terms of\nstrategy, IT, HR, marketing and finance.\nFinancing: Getting cash from the Queen of Spain\nHuman Resources: Recruiting and motivating the soldiers and sailors\nTechnology: Leveraging diverse technologies from gun-power to navigation\nKnowledge transfer: Pizarro learned from Cortes and other adventurers. The Incas did not\nhave a written language, so knowledge transfer was difficult.\nMarketing: Playing one Incan faction off against the other faction.\n- New tire producer (McKinsey): Please calculate the Brazilian market for a new tire producer.\nShow your calculation. How may tires are sold per year in Brazil.\nUse market size framework. First separated in auto and others. Decided to go with auto\nonly, separated in new and reposition market, life cycle and so on.\nGeneral Tips: Be interactive. Be creative. Be organized. Do not think a simple frame work\nis going to save your life.\n- Bank loans (BCG): One bank used to provide financial service to big industrial companies.\nBecause of recent economic crisis, those big companies are facing troubles to repay their\ndebts. The bank is looking for new customers, e. g. small or medium sized companies. How\ncan the bank determine the credit of those companies to make loan decisions?\nFinancial ratio analysis was useful.\n- Revlon (PriceWaterhouse Coopers): The question is purposely vague – you are asked by CEO\nof Revlon to estimate how many shades of lipstick the company should carry. You could\nthink in terms of\n- Market penetration – Revlon is “mainstream brand”; talk about brand extensions, etc.\n- Profit – 20% of products make 80% of profits\n- How many lines of shade are physically possible – from brown/dark red to pink to\nother colors\n- Should Revlon think about “seasonal”/faddish colors? Again, brand name erosion.\n- What about manufacturing process? At what point are the “color dyes” added? How\nwould each scenario (beginning vs. end) affect production costs of lipstick\nChannel – just how much shelf space would Revlon’s retailers devote to its products?\nThink department store and drug-stores and estimate size of counter.\nFrameworks used: Perhaps 3C-4P’s, but no specific framework applicable – one of these\nestimates questions but I use a number of ways to “triangulate” the answer.\nOperations concepts such as bottlenecks, lead time, etc. were also useful.\nTaking Supply Chain class was extremely helpful for this case.\n- Hilarious Bill: Bill Clinton has just fired Hillary as Chief of Health Reforms and has\nappointed you to fill the position. While in this office, you discover that kidney dialysis is a\n\nmajor portion of public health care expenditures. What analytical techniques would you use\nto determine if this cost could be reduced?\n- Essentially, you would want to see if the high costs are due to greater incidences, the\ncost of the procedure, or both. You would also want to determine if the costs are\nhigher due to illegal or unscrupulous practices such as embezzlement of funds,\npayoffs, etc.\n- Analyze the proportion of public versus private health expenditures that are applied to\nkidney dialysis treatment to determine if unscrupulous practitioners are pushing this\nexpensive treatment onto the public health budget.\n- Compare the incidence of kidney disorder in this country with other countries. Is\nours higher? If so, can public policy or efforts to increase awareness help to reduce\nit?\n- If incidence is indeed higher in the U.S., build a model (regression perhaps) that will\nsomehow determine the factors that have the most causal relationships with kidney\ntreatment. Perhaps those who are typically covered by public funds (the poor,\nelderly) have a higher incidence of kidney problems. Is there room for any type of\npreventative program for these groups?\n- If the cost of the procedure seems high compared with similar medical procedures, it\ncould be due to professional fees, consumables, or high capital equipment costs.\nLimiting the amount of government compensation could cut professional fees.\nEmploying new technologies could cut consumables and equipment costs.\n- Oil Slick: What factors determine the world price of oil?\n- Consider the influence of the capital markets and how future spot oil prices and\nspeculation in the market impact world oil prices.\n- Prices in general economic terms are a function of supply and demand in the market.\n- Demand: Explore the factors aside from price that would effect demand such as new\ntechnology, import quotas, wars, etc. It turns out that global demand for oil is\ninelastic meaning that changes in prices have less of an effect on quantity demanded.\nIf this is the case, fluctuations in supply will have a greater impact on the price.\n- Supply: Examine the impact of the various regional suppliers and their cost structures\n(for example, high cost in the U.S., low cost in the Middle East).\n- At this point, you may recommend drawing a simple graph. The low cost producers\nsuch as Saudi Arabia would be at the lower left end of the supply curve while high\ncost producers such as the U.S. would be far to the right on the quantity produced x-\naxis. Thus, we can conclude that Saudi Arabia, assuming that it has the capacity to\nproduce more than it currently is, controls the price of oil. However, its production is\nlimited by OPEC rules. If, however, they use their excess capacity to control price\n(as in the case of the Persian Gulf War), the pricing power lies in their hands. Oil\nprices did not skyrocket during the war because Saudi Arabia promised to increase\nproduction to a level that eclipsed the global pre-war level.\n- Aluminum Advantage: An aluminum can manufacturer has discovered a way of improving its\nmanufacturing process. As a result, its manufacturing costs have been reduced from 89 cents\nto 79 cents. How can your client best exploit this new cost advantage?\n- Clearly your client should either drop prices and pass the savings onto customers\nwhile increasing demand or keep prices the same and reap additional profits.\n\n- It turns out that your client is the leader in its market with 40% share and supplies\ndirectly to major beverage manufacturers. The number two competitor in the market\nhas about 30% of the market and the rest is shared by many small competitors.\n- Substitutes: Aluminum cans have a lower priced substitute, steel cans, which have\ninferior printing and stamping characteristics. Steel cans are used by customers who\ndo not want to pay the premium for aluminum cans.\n- If our client drops prices, other competitors will have to follow since this is a\ncommodity market and not following would mean a quick demise. The decrease in\nprice may increase your client’s market share marginally, while some smaller\ncompetitors will have to start exiting the industry and larger competitors will have to\ninvest in R&D to try to uncover our client’s cost advantage.\n- Impact on steel can substitutes: Steel can users will start switching to aluminum cans\nwith the lower price thus hurting manufacturers in that market. The resulting growth\nin the aluminum can market will attract steel can manufacturers to enter. Since some\nof these manufacturers have deep pockets and strong backing, these new entrants\ncould pose a future threat to your client.\n- Conclusion: It is probably best for your client to retain prices and generate extra\nprofits now. The cost advantage and subsequent lowering of prices may help in the\nfuture during a price war.\n- Corny Costs: A corn refining company has a high proportion of fixed costs. It has 2 principal\nbuyers, each buying a little over 40% of the product. Should the refining company try to\nchange its customer base? Why or why not?\n- First, examine your client’s cost structure to find out what components make up these\nhigh fixed costs such as plant, equipment, and other capital expenses. Explore ways\nto decrease fixed costs such as outsourcing, more efficient plant operations, newer\nand more productive equipment, reducing overhead, etc.\n- Next, benchmark these costs against competitors or leaders in the market to try to\nascertain why their fixed costs are disproportionately lower than your client’s.\n- Why does your client have only two major customers? Is this rationale due to a long\nstanding relationship, joint venture, niche market, low overall demand, etc.?\n- It turns out that the buyers pay transportation costs and the company has no cost\nadvantages by having only two buyers.\n- The company is a price taker.\n- Investigate demand and capacity. One way to overcome high fixed costs is with large\nsales volumes to spread over these fixed costs. Does your client have more demand\nfor its refining services than just these two principal buyers do? If it does have more\ndemand, do your client’s facilities have enough capacity to meet the market’s\ndemand?\n- The key point is that companies with high fixed costs need to always operate at or\nclose to capacity. Having only two buyers gives each buyer a lot of power. It is thus\npreferable to have many buyers each with a smaller share.\n- Utility cost-cutting: A credits and collections department of a medium size utility company\nhas hired you. They have two primary means of receiving customer’s payments. The first\nway is through the mail, which accounts for 90% of their billings. The second way is a\ncollections office located in a community close to downtown. Presently it costs them only\n\n$0.10 per bill through the mail but $1.20 per bill through the agency they operate downtown.\nThey have hired you to help them reduce the cost per bill of the agency. What would you do?\n- First, always clarify if your client is talking about 90% of sales volume or sales\nrevenue. In this case it does not matter.\n- Inquire about why it is so critical to keep this costly facility open for such a small\npercentage of their sales. It turns out your client is very loyal to its customers who\nprefer to use this walk-up facility.\n- Explore what other uses your client can use the facility for to generate revenue to\nspread out these costs. It turns out there are a couple of video games in the front\nfoyer and there are two big rooms in the back they rent out to local clubs but both\nreally have no potential impact on helping cover costs.\n- Is there a cheaper area for this building to be located? It turns out that the answer is\nno. Your client likes the present location given its proximity to its customers.\n- How does your client’s competition operate its collection facilities? Do they have\nsimilar problems? Is it possible to outsource at a cheaper cost? No, it turns out your\nclient is the only one to have this sort of operation.\n- Explore the cost associated with this building. It turns out the facility has long since\nbeen paid for and has very little overhead cost. It staffs 5 people all the time. (Hint,\nis there always enough demand to warrant 5 personnel?) It turns out they are not\nalways that busy and can have fewer shifts throughout the month. This brings the\ncost per bill down to $1.00.\n- Examine all the functions this office serves. It turns out your client uses this facility\nto also open customer accounts and as a customer service center. (This is the main\nissue of the case, your client should be splitting the cost per bill in three because this\ncomplex serves three different functions.)\n- This gets the cost per bill down to $0.30 per bill, which is as low as you can get.\n- Real-estate Windfall: You inherited a parcel of land along Sunset Blvd. What will you do\nwith it?\nThis is a financing decision case and is all about options, opportunity costs, and net present\nvalue. Questions and issues you should raise include:\n- Is there an existing building on the property or is it empty land??\n- Are there any liens or mortgages on the property?\n- Are there any factors that might threaten ownership or development?\n- Are there limits on how high apartments in this area can be?\n- The interviewer may entertain several notions of what to do with the land depending on\nthe direction of the discussion. Assume the land is not in a residential area but instead\nis located in a business area.\n- Assuming that your goal is to try and earn the greatest return on this land, this case\nturns into a classic NPV problem. Discounting your net cash flows (the difference\nbetween your operating revenue and costs), you have essentially four different options\nin which to earn the highest NPV:\n1) Sell the property\n2) Build on the land\n3) Lease the land\n4) Some combination of 1,2, and 3\n\n- With each option, discuss the different methodologies of assessing the value of selling,\nbuilding, or leasing. Benchmark against existing property values in the area and\nidentify the pros and cons of each option depending on trends in the real estate market.\n- Multimedia Christmas: A small multimedia company recently released 2 CD-ROM’s late.\nThey lost a lot of money and now need to raise cash quickly for the upcoming Christmas\nseasons. How would you approach this?\nObviously the key here is that cash needs to be raised quickly. Here are some options to\nexplore to raise the sufficient funds:\n- Look at the balance sheet. Are there significant account receivables that can be quickly\ncollected? (It turns out there are some but are not due yet, so offer these customers\ndiscounts for immediate payment).\n- Investigate the option of borrowing cash from banks and other institutions.\n- Are there parts of the business, excess inventories, etc. that could be divested?\n- Can they get advances from some of their long-standing customers on product orders to\nbe delivered next year?\n- Japanese Investment: Your client is the California State government. They are trying to\nattract Japanese business investors to the state. They want them to open businesses here to\nincrease jobs and improve the economy. How would you market this concept to Japan?\nFor any marketing question, a fail-safe framework is an analysis of the 3Cs:\n- Customers: What does California have that Japan needs – look for links in the\neconomy. For which sector(s) would it be cheaper for Japanese manufacturers to build\nin CA; e.g. computer hardware. Financial considerations: which companies can afford\nto open new plants or establish operations? They should be exclusively targeted. Also\nexamine companies that already have existing business relationships or investments in\nCalifornia.\n- Competitors: What other regions could Japanese businesses go to and are they going\nthere? Why or why not? What other states/countries are trying to attract Japanese\ninvestments? What are their tactics, and what will their reaction be to California’s bid?\nWhat Japanese firms already have strong alliances with other territories? These firms\nshould not be at the top of the target list.\n- Company: In this case, the state of California. Any solution should highlight\nCalifornia’s competitive advantage. Consult a marketing and advertising firm to\nidentify and promote the most attractive aspects of having a business venture located in\nCalifornia. Illustrate positive economic trends, the fact that Southern California itself\ngenerates one of the top ten GNPs in the world. Highlight the climate, access to raw\nmaterials (port of S.F. and L.A.), strong Asian and other cultural consumer base, access\nto various distribution channels, etc.\n- Consulting: You have been hired by a consulting company to evaluate the future of the\nconsulting business. How would you approach this?\nThis is a Porter’s Five Forces question. In general, any questions that ask for a broad\nindustry analysis can usually be structured around the Five Forces.\n- For example, who are the customers? Possibly any firm could use consulting services.\nAre there market segments? Are some firms using consulting more than others?\n\nIdentify any changes or current trends in consumer’s behavior. What is most important\nto your potential customers (e.g., cost, quality, service, reputation, etc.)?\n- Who are the competitors? Companies may choose to solve problems in-house or use\nindividual experts in particular areas as opposed to hiring consulting teams. What are\nyour competitors’ strengths and weaknesses?\n- What is the overall industry like? Analyze the threat of new consulting companies\n(minimal) and industry trends. What are the drivers of success in this industry?\n- What are your client’s particular core competencies and how can they leverage these to\nachieve a sustainable competitive advantage? What different types of consulting does\nthe firm engage in? What external factors would affect your client's business (e.g., the\neconomy, regulatory actions, international business growth, etc.)?\n- Magazine Publisher: A magazine publisher is trying to decide how many magazines she\nshould deliver to each individual distribution outlet in order to maximize profits. She has\nmassive amounts of historical data for sales volumes through these outlets and a well-\nconstructed internal accounting system. How should she go about computing an appropriate\namount?\nThe best way to solve this case is to draw out an analytical framework and fill in the gaps.\nIt should be immediately observed that in economic terms, to maximize profits, you need\nto set marginal revenues equal to marginal costs (the revenue of one more magazine sold\nequals the incremental cost of that magazine).\n- The marginal revenue for a magazine would be its cover price multiplied by the\nprobability that it will be sold.\n- The probability of sale, within an appropriate confidence interval, could be determined\nfrom historical data.\n- The marginal cost could be determined from the internal accounting data.\n- While it is not always possible to calculate these individual increments in a business,\nanother similar method would be to use the data to look at the revenues and costs\nassociated with each distribution outlet.\n- Try to assess the demand of each region in sales revenue and then look at the different\nprofit margins for each location. You should be able to identify if it is costing too\nmuch to distribute magazines to an outlet that is not generating as much sales as\nanother location with a greater.\n- Skis: How many skis were sold in the U.S. last year?\nLike cases before, the key here is to carefully walk the interviewer through your\nassumptions and then come up with a figure. Here is a good approach:\n- Assume 250 million people in the U.S.\n- Assume 10% of the population actually skis (You many want to support this\nassumption by anecdotal or other evidence.) That gives you a total skiing population\nof 25 million.\n- There are two important breakdowns among these 25 million – those who own their\nown skis and those who rent. Probably only 25% own skis (you know this because you\nare an avid skier, have a lot of friends who ski, etc.) for a total of 6.25 million new skis\nbuyers.\n- Estimate how often people buy new skis – say every three years. So of the 6.25 million\nskis buyers, roughly 2.1 million bought skis last year.\n\n- Those who rent probably ski less frequently than those who own. But ski rental places\nbuy lots of skis. It is hard to estimate the number of skis bought by rental shops but\nmake assumptions as above. *Need to come up with a guess for the number of ski\nrental shops in the U.S. Then make an assumption for the number of new skis they buy\neach year, remembering that most rental skis are used.)\n- Add this number to your 2.1 million and you have your total of ski units.\n- Bubble Gum: Estimate the number of bubble gum chewed in a day in the US. Make any\nassumptions required to solve the problem. State the assumptions and the calculation in your\nsolution.\nAssumptions:\n- Number of people in the US = 250 million.\n- 75% of gum is chewed by people ages 8-15.\n- 75% of population between 8-15 chews gum.\n- 10% of population is between 8-15 (assumes flat population distribution between ages 0\nto 70; 10% of population in each age bracket).\n- People who chew gum chew an average of two sticks per day.\nNumber of people between ages 8-15: 250 million *.1 = 25 million\nPortion of people ages 8-15 who chew gum: 25 million *.75 - 18.75 million\nAmount of gum chewed by ages 8-15: 18.75 million *2 = 37.5 million\nsticks\nTotal gum chewed: 37.5/.75 = approx. 50 million sticks\nof gum/day",
  "Goizueta_2006_USPS Employment": "From Cornell's case-book\nUSPS Employment\nHow many people work for the post office?\nSOLUTION STRUCTURE\nThis is a pure estimation case. What matters is the way you get to an answer, not necessarily the\nanswer itself. As the interviewee is working through the problem they should make it abundantly\nclear what their assumptions are. To test the interviewee, you could always ask, “Why did you\nmake that assumption?” or “What is your reasoning for that assumption?” It can be tackled\nmany ways but here is an example of one way it could be done:\nAssumptions:\n- There are four kinds of employees: drivers, tellers, admin., and sorters. The air transport side\nis mostly composed of private carriers.\n- Of all the zip codes possible (99,999), all are allocated to an area and used. (round to 100,000)\n- Every zip code has one post office.\n- Every post office serves the same number of entities.\n- There is an average of three windows (tellers), three sorters, and four letter carriers attached to\neach zip code. (10 employees)\n- Add on 10% for the admin and intrastate drivers.\nDo the math: (100,000 x 10) x 1.1 = 1,100,000 people work for the post office\nIn reality:\n890,000 people work for the post office. There are 38,000 post offices and 234,000 letter carriers.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Shortstop to Base": "Shortstop to Base\nIn professional baseball, how long does it take for a baseball to travel from the shortstop to first\nbase?\nSOLUTION STRUCTURE\nAssumptions:\n- The bases are 90 feet apart.\n- The distance from shortstop to first base is about 120 feet.\n- A major league pitcher can throw about 90-95 mph.\n- A major league shortstop can throw about 80 mph.\nThe key is to be able to convert miles per hour to feet per second.\n80mph to feet/hour:\n5280 feet/mile: (80 x 5280) = 422,400 feet/hour\nConvert units:\n- 60 minutes per hour, 60 seconds per minute = 3600 seconds/hour (422,400/3600) = 117\nfeet/second\n- 120 feet from shortstop to first base, thrown at 117 feet per second = (120/117) = just over a\nsecond (1.02 seconds).\nDon’t be afraid to round off these large numbers\n- 5000 feet/mile x 80 = 400,000\n- 4000 seconds/minute: 400,000/4000 = 100 ft/second\n- 120/100=just over a second\nIt’s much easier this way.

  "Goizueta_2006_Colorful M&M's": "Colorful M&M's\nHow many M&Ms of each color go into a 3-ounce bag?\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n- 20 M&Ms make up a 3 ounce bag\n- There are six colors of M&Ms: yellow, red, green, blue, brown, orange\n- They all cost the same to produce\n- Research indicates that customers have no preferences of color.\n- Color is added on at the end of the mfr process\n- They are mixed in the same ratio that they are produced\n- Capacity of adding color:\n- 3 tanks hold the 3 primary colors: yellow, red, blue\n- 1 remaining tank used to mix colors to prepare: green, brown, orange\n- Each of the 4 tanks has equal capacity.\n- The 1 mixing tank pulls yellow, red, and blue as needed from the same supply that fills the\nthree primary tanks.\n- They only refill the primary tanks when all three have emptied.\n- Tanks are allowed to run out before they refill for batch control purposes\n- Proportion to mix brown: 2/3 yellow, 1/6 red, 1/6 blue\n- Proportion to mix green: ½ yellow, ½ blue\n- Proportion to mix orange: ½ yellow, ½ red\nSOLUTION STRUCTURE\nThis case is designed to get you into a manufacturing state of mind. The idea is that you will\nburn through yellow faster than any other color since it is needed the most. Therefore, there\nshould technically be more red and blue M&Ms in every bag. They will still be produced after\nthe supply of yellow has run out, stopping production of yellow, green, orange, and brown.",

How do you go about analyzing the investment?\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nThe property has 5,000 acres of open, undeveloped land.\nThe property is 45 minutes from Telluride, a skiing area, a home of a large summer film festival,\nand a five-star resort and spa. The land has several small hills and abuts a mountain.\nThere are 7 horse-riding stables in the area, two of which offer cattle drives, like in City Slickers.\nCompany currently owns hotels, strip malls, and office buildings nationwide.\nSOLUTION ANALYSIS\nYou need to determine the highest and best use for the land in order to assess its value. To do\nthis, you should start with the 3Cs:\n- Competitors - Analyze other similar plots of land that have been developed with like\ncharacteristics – Utah, Montana, even Eastern regions such as New Hampshire.\n- What other commercial developments exist in the area? Is there an abundance of any\none type—horseback riding stable, fly-fishing camps?

  "Goizueta_2006_Video-retailer Profitability": "Video-retailer Profitability\nOur client is a major entertainment company on the West Coast. One of their divisions is a\nleading home retailer. During the late ‘80’s and early ‘90’s this division had a great run-opening\n4,000 stores and realizing considerable profits. In the last two years both growth and profit have\ndeclined substantially. You have been brought in by the CEO to assess the situation and provide\nrecommendations.\nBackground: Our client’s division is not unlike a chain of Blockbuster video stores. The majority\nof their business is in movie rental with a much smaller portion in sales.\nSOLUTION STRUCTURE\n- Start with a simple: (Profit = Revenue – Costs) structure\n- Analyze the competitive situation\n- Analyze the “substitution” factor – how else are consumers getting movies?\nCosts: Revenues:\nCost of the new movies: (Actually decreased) # of rentals: (decreased, traffic down)\nOverhead: (No change) Price of rental: (No change)\nSG&A: (No change) Sale of rentals: (decreased)\nLeases, other: (No change) Accessories: (No change)\nKey Learning:\nCosts have actually decreased, but not enough to offset the decreased store traffic.\nCompetitive Assessment/Substitutes: (List potential causes of decreased traffic)\n- New movie stores: (No real change)\n- New In-home sources – cable on demand: (Potential for future but no real current affect)\n- Sales of movies for home use and collection: (Sales have increased dramatically)\n[Once the key issues have been identified, the interviewer describes the changing industry:]\nWhen division was growing, it could buy excess numbers of the new releases to satisfy customer\ndemand. Later, they would send the excess copies to the new stores as part of their “library” of\nexisting tapes. With fewer new stores opening, this is no longer an option-therefore fewer new\nreleases have been ordered.\nRecently, the studios have allowed new releases to be sold through warehouse stores (Wal-Mart)\nat the same time they are made available to the rental retailers. Thus, many of our customers are\npurchasing rather than renting. In addition, when customers rented a new release, they quite\noften rented an existing tape from the library (additional lost revenue).\nBased on this industry outlook, what would you recommend for the division?\nProvide a recap:\nIt appears as though the major issue facing the division is a reduction in store traffic for new\nreleases. This is mainly due to the sale of these same releases through alternate channels. How\ncan we regain store traffic or offset the rental losses?\n\nRecommendations: (these are just a few of the potential options)\n- Develop new, more convenient locations-kiosks, pick-up/delivery\n- Develop pricing/bundling formats combining new releases with existing movies\n- Offer “rent to buy” programs – rent the first time, then have option to purchase",

The company is located in central New York, where\nit has resided since its founding almost 100 years ago. Its customers are primarily marketing\nconcerns, not unlike P&G, that brand your client’s products. Despite years of steady business\nand profits, the last three quarters have been below expectations. In fact, the company is losing\nmoney, and shareholders are not happy. You have been hired by the CEO to investigate the\ncompany’s profitability. She is expecting some recommendations.\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n- The product is unchanged – no new formulas, sizes, etc. – nothing that would affect sales\n- Profit margins are generally steady (but very small! – soap is a commodity, after all)\n- The economy is normal – no exogenous variables (i.e., customer out of business, etc. –\nnothing going on here)\n- Recent downsizing reduced labor force by 15%\n- Old equipment was recently scrapped – the plant was almost 100 years old!\n- New plant equipment – purchased on credit (yes, this results in a new fixed cost, if asked)\nRevenue Drivers\nQ: What are the revenue drivers? A: You tell me, you’re the consultant – why don’t you outline\nwhat you think they are.\nQ: What has changed? A: Nothing: sales, price, volume, market size, customer base, etc. are all\nsteady.\nVariable Costs\nQ: What are the variable costs? A: You tell me, you’re the consultant – why don’t you outline\nwhat you think they are.\nQ: What has changed? A: Raw materials unchanged, labor reduced.\nFixed Costs\nQ: What are the fixed costs? A: You tell me, you’re the consultant – why don’t you outline what\nyou think they are. Reduced labor costs from downsizing means less fixed costs. Loan and\ninterest payments for equipment > existing profit margins (this is the key). Nothing else has\nchanged, if asked.\nSOLUTION STRUCTURE\n- Framework: Profits = Revenues – (FC + VC)\n- Examine revenue drivers: What’s changed?\n- Examine variable costs: What’s changed?\n- Examine fixed costs: What’s changed?\n- Summarize analysis\n- Provide recommendations\nSOLUTION ANALYSIS\n\nGive up? The company recently purchased plant equipment to replace old plant equipment. The\nold equipment was paid for but the new equipment gave rise to fixed payments for the loan and\ninterest.

Client does\nnot.\n- Competitor produces in large batches and has loads of inventory.\n- High changeover costs in jam production process at both the client and the competitor – there\nare no dedicated lines for different types of fruit.\nSOLUTION ANALYSIS\n- This is not a numbers case per se, although interviewee should attempt to ID the key\ncomponents of the $1MM extra cost that the client has. The extra costs arise from:\n- Changeovers / JIT system\n- High overtime\n- Buying fruit out of season\n- Dedicated fleet\nRecommendations:\n- Move to larger batch size.\n- Ditch JIT and produce to forecast to smooth production and overtime.\n- Buy fruit in season.\n- Consider outsourcing transport.\nKey underlying problem:\n\nHow do you gently tell the client that her $1MM new computer system is a bad decision and a\nsunk cost?\nBonus:\nID the potential problems with the workforce when your recommendations decrease overtime\nand affect their pay dramatically.",

  "Goizueta_2006_Trucking Profitability": "Trucking Profitability\nA regional trucking company has hired you because they are slowly losing money. Why are they\nlosing money and how do you fix the problem?\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n- Located in North Carolina and serving a few large markets (NY, Atlanta, Pittsburgh, Chicago)\n- They ship two types of items: specialty furniture and commodity items\n- The furniture trucking market:\n- Loyal clients\n- High profit for the trucking company\n- The commodity market:\n- No loyalty\n- Losing money to compete – eroding your client’s profit margin\n- Sales force: located in major markets to drum up business (typically commodity orders)\n- Competition is increasing as a few large national trucking companies have entered their\nmarket.\n- Logistics of delivery\n- Furniture shipments are generally one way, i.e. they don’t have any furniture to haul\nback from their delivery points and must return empty if they want to ship furniture\nexclusively (way too expensive to run a truck empty)\n- The sales force finds stuff (typically commodity items) to backhaul to utilize the\nempty truck space\n- They could lease the empty space to a national carrier but they are the competitors\nand the revenue is lower than their current commodity trucking business\nSOLUTION ANALYSIS\nA typical way to look at this problem is Profit = Revenue – Costs. The revelation that the\ncommodity business is losing money and pulling the profit down appears to be a key piece of\ninformation. It leads you towards the idea of either getting rid of the commodity trucking, and\nrunning the trucks empty one way, or forming an alliance with a national carrier. The problem is\nthat running the trucks empty is way too expensive, and would cause you to loose even more\nmoney, and the revenue from an alliance is lower than the revenue you currently enjoy to truck\ncommodity items around. So what do you do?\nA good candidate should ignore the lower revenue. Revenue is not necessarily the issue, what is\nthe potential profit? By going with an alliance the company would be able to substantially reduce\ntheir sales force (costs) as they mostly drum up commodity business, which would be\nunnecessary. The lower revenue is offset by an even larger drop in costs.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Phone-repair Profitability": "Phone-repair Profitability\nYour client is a telephone company trying to reduce the costs and improve performance in the\nrepair service operation. How do you approach the problem? How would you go about\nimplementing your solution?\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n- The company has 5 regional centers in 5 different cities and a corporate headquarters.\n- You have been brought in through a process improvement initiative currently underway at\ncorporate. The regional centers are not aware that their repair service is being examined.\nSOLUTION STRUCTURE\nBegin with the 3 C’s to get details about your client and the nature of the competition in the\nindustry. Ultimately you can go through a profitability analysis to try and drill down to the root\ncause of the high costs in repair service. Don’t forget to outline a process to follow to implement\nyour solution.\nSOLUTION ANALYSIS\nThis is a regulated industry with a unionized labor force that will play a large role in your\nanalysis.\nGenerally, the utilities industry has faced very little competition for local service and has thus\nhad almost no need to institute and track performance measures with its management control\nsystems. You will almost certainly have to develop new baselines for measuring performance in\nthe repair service department within the company. Some possible measures could be: time to\nrepair, time to dispatch, customer satisfaction expressed through callback, etc.\nIf these baselines are new to the company, your team will need time for these baselines to\ngenerate information that can be compared with other “best-of-class” companies in this industry.\nThe profitability analysis should touch upon recent capital expenditures, deteriorating\ninfrastructure, high wages, escalating repair materials costs, low productivity in the department;\nanything that might contribute to high costs in repair service.\nDon’t forget the implementation part of this question. Basic ideas here include developing a\npilot program to test out your solution and selecting a pilot site, getting buy-in and cooperation at\nthe regional center level, establishing objective measurements to gauge the success of the pilot,\nand finally, developing and presenting a corporate-wide rollout of the proposed changes.\nChanging the culture of the regional centers is going to be a huge barrier to success in this\nproject. This component is largely the function of the “Change-Management” area of the firm.\nIssues here might be union wage pressure, job security, changing the demands on the workforce,\ngaining commitment from informal leaders that can champion your solution.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Insurance Profits": "Insurance Profits\nAn insurance company has two annuity products: a fixed annuity product and a variable annuity\nproduct. These products have a target ROI of 15% but are only earning 5% right now. The fixed\nannuity product pays the clients a fixed income stream at fixed interest rates. The variable\nproduct has returns that vary with the market. The market is doing great and the company is\nwondering how to improve their returns on these products. How would you go about thinking\nabout this problem? What are some potential areas for improvement?\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n- On the fixed product, the company makes money based on the spread between the fixed\nincome stream they’re paying out and the money they’re earning on the investment in the\nmarket.\n- On the variable product, the company earns money through charging fees.\n- The company sells 20% of the fixed product and 80% of the variable product.\nSOLUTION STRUCTURE\nStart with the 3Cs to understand the risk profile of the company, the nature of the competition it\nfaces, and the customers that buy these instruments. Then move to a profitability analysis to\nidentify where this company is losing money. If you are not familiar with annuity products, you\nshould ask sufficient questions to ensure that you understand how the products make money for\nthe insurance company.\nSOLUTION ANALYSIS\n- The obvious answer seems to be that they need to get into higher paying investments to\nachieve higher market returns. However, keep in mind that they have fixed annuity product\nthey are committed to paying.\n- The company could calculate the duration of their liabilities (the fixed stream of cash\noutflows) to ensure that they have adequate assets to support their liabilities.\n- The company could also focus on cutting costs to raise their returns. They have marketing\n(ads, pamphlets, phone personnel), broker fees, sales personnel, transaction fees. The\ncompany does all of this in-house. They could probably outsource and have these services\nperformed more cheaply.\n- The fees the company charges for the variable rate product could be compared to the\ncompetition. If they are too high, the company may want to lower fees to get a higher volume\nof customers. If they are too low, they may want to raise rates to be more competitive.\nChances are, the existing customers with an annuity probably won’t withdraw their funds.\n- The mix of products could also be considered. The company only earns a flat fee on the\nvariable product. The amount of return made on the fixed product can vary widely, but has\nthe potential to make a very good return with smart investing. The company should shift\nmarketing and sales efforts to the fixed product.\nSince more and more people are investing in 401K plans and other retirement plans, this could\nbe a potentially large target market for a secure fixed annuity product.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Airline-route Acquisition": "Airline-route Acquisition\nA major airline is considering acquiring an existing route from Tokyo to NY. How can it\ndetermine if the route is a good idea?\nSOLUTION STRUCTURE\nProfitability analysis looks like the best approach. Simply determine if revenue less costs equals\na positive profit. Then, analyze the factors that go into revenue and the factors that go into cost\nto come to a conclusion.\nSOLUTION ANALYSIS\n- Occupancy rates and expected prices will determine revenues. Both of these will be\ndetermined by expected demand, the competitive environment, and the extent to which our\nclient could win over passengers from competitor routes. Mentioning fare wars and\ncompetitor reaction is a good idea. Looking at competitor occupancy rates and fares could be\nused as a point of research.\n- Operating costs will depend on expected fuel costs, incremental costs for landing rights, etc.\nMost airplanes are fixed costs because they are owned or under long-term leases. However, is\nthere another route that is more profitable that these planes could be dedicated to? It is also\nvery important to estimate the cost of cannibalization of existing Tokyo-LA, LA-NY routes.\nWill these routes be continued at the same level of operation? And last but not least, it is\nimportant to note that losing passengers to cannibalization is better than losing them to\ncompetitors.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Cable Operations": "Cable Operations\nTwo years ago a venture capital company purchased a cable TV system that had access to 3\nmillion households in Arizona and New Mexico. The VC firm was attracted to the extremely\nlarge subscriber potential, and the potential for considerable return. Despite their best efforts,\nthey have failed to turn a profit in the past three years. You have been hired to determine if they\ncan turn a profit or if they should sell.\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n- The cable system features fiber-optic lines to each street corner, but not yet direct to the home.\n- Fixed costs are extremely high due to the distance between cities in the system.\n- The debt and maintenance costs are also higher than system in metropolitan areas.\n- The current system is only at 43% capacity (# of subscribers) vs. a 63% industry average.\n- Low subscription rate (43%) is not attributable to life-style or cable programming. People in\nthe service area actually watch more TV than the national average; the programming offers\nwhat they like to watch.\n- The cable company covers an even mix of small city urban, suburban and rural areas.\n- The population is rising faster than the national average, growth is suburban.\n- There are 4 network stations (reaching the whole area), and 9 independent regional broadcast\nstations. Also, 17 percent of the residents have satellite systems in operation (DirecTV,\nEchoStar, etc).\n- The quality of the reception of local broadcasts: for those in the immediate area, signal is\nvery strong.\n- The signal is free, but those subscribing to satellite services pay a monthly fee equal to that of\nthe cable service.\n- It takes 10 paying customers per sq. mile to break even, at least 20 potential per sq. mile to\neven consider entering the market. Although the area averages 20+ residents per sq. mile in\nrural areas, total actual subscribers is < 10.\nSOLUTION STRUCTURE\n- At a minimum, the answer should:\n- Analyze current revenues and cost structures – do revenues > costs?\n- Analyze the market potential of the area – is there growth potential?\n- Analyze the competitive situation and substitutes – is this product/service a winner?\n- Provide recommendations – establish a clear decision rule\nCOSTS REVENUES\nFixed costs associated with laying cable Subscribers’ monthly fees for basic services\nVariable costs of new customers (equipment) Subscribers’ fees for premium channels\nMaintenance of the cable system Subscribers’ fees for other premium services\nDebt associated with fixed costs Advertising fees from commercials\nFranchise fees to municipalities Commissions from shopping channels\nSOLUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThis is a straight profitability analysis to determine whether or not the VC firm should continue\nor withdraw. GOOD answers identify a decision rule that includes an analysis of: (1)\nprofitability – whether or not the venture is profitable (2) adequate return – whether or not the\nreturn exceeds the VC firm’s opportunity costs (3) management expertise – whether or not the\nclient has the managerial skills to make the venture succeed.\nHigh fixed costs are overwhelming the current revenues, and the current subscriber rate is low.\nGood answers should investigate why and if it can be fixed. Good answers also might identify\nthe insight that distance between customers is important. The rural character of this subscriber\narea means the sell-rate must be higher since there are fewer potential customers per sq. mile.\nOutstanding answers might uncover that as the cable TV business evolved, many rural residents\nalready have satellite dish systems that afford multiple channels. What would it take to win\nthese customers over, or why can’t they be won over.",

  "Goizueta_2006_Bank-loan Operations": "Bank-loan Operations\nA bank has a loan issuing operation that requires the following steps:\n- loan application generation at branch bank\n- complete applicant background check at branch bank\n- send application and background check to loan processing office\n- update/recheck background check (takes much less time than original check)\n- loan is approved or denied\nThe bank is considering getting rid of the first background check and only relying on the loan\nprocessor's check to speed their service for customers. If the loan processor does the whole check\nwith a new software system, the check takes 1 additional hour at the processor's office per\napplication.\n- The average profit margin per loan over time is $0.20 per dollar loaned for a \"good\" loan\n(loan is repaid)\n- The average marginal loss per loan over time is $0.50 per dollar loaned for a \"bad\" loan (loan\nis not repaid)\n- 50% of the applicants pass the first background check\n- 90% pass the second\nShould the bank proceed with the new system?\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n- Cost of branch bank background check = $100/loan (eliminate this cost with the proposed\nsystem).\n- Processor's labor hour costs $60 (at branch and at processing office).\n- Number of loan applicants is only 1,000 per year.\n- Average value of loan is $10,000.\n- The proposed processing program has a 40% acceptance rate.\n- Additional cost of new program is $50 per loan applicant.\n- The original loan processing system has 10% bad loans.\n- The proposed system has 5% bad loans (it is more discriminating).\nSOLUTION STRUCTURE\nThis case obviously tests your analytical skills. Do not answer the question without paper or\ncalculator to impress the interviewer if your math skills are poor, since this strategy could easily\nbackfire, making you look stupid. This case is straightforward, but make sure that you have all\nthe information necessary to develop an answer.\nYou should calculate a comparative profit per year for the original and proposed Systems.\nHere's an example:\nOriginal System:\n(1000 applications) x (0.45 loans per application) x ([90% good loans x $0.20 per dollar for a\ngood loan) - (10% bad loans x $0.50 per dollar for a bad loan)] x ($10,000 per loan) = (450\nloans) x ($0.13 expected per loan dollar) x ($10,000 per Loans) = $585,000 expected profit\nBut this method costs an additional $100 per loan application:\nProfit = $585,000 - (1000 applications) x ($100/application) = $485,000 comparative profit\n\nProposed System:\n(1000) x (0.4) x [(95% x $0.20) - (5% x $0.50)] x ($10,000) = $660,000 of profits\nBut, there's an additional cost of 1 hour per application at the processing office profit = $660,000\n- [($60/hr) x (1 hr/application) x (1000 application/yr)] = $600,000\nAnd there's the cost of the new program:\nProfit = $600,000 - ($50/application) x (1,000 application) = $550,000 of total comparative\nprofit\nSOLUTION ANALYSIS\nBased on the raw data, the bank should progress with the new system. However, you need to\ndiscuss whether the bank can make the change. Mention any retraining and system installation\ncosts that are necessary to change the system, and don’t forget to evaluate the cost of the new\nsystem itself. Also you may want to mention that a faster loan processing speed may help the\nbank get more business.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Mass-merchandiser Advertising (Deloitte)": "Mass-merchandiser Advertising (Deloitte)\nYour client is a major mass merchandise retailer in a turnaround situation. To improve\nprofitability and win back Wall Street confidence, the retailer is pursuing significant cost\nreductions.\nThe Advertising department has been charged with reducing Sunday circular advertising costs by\n$25 million in 2001. This represents a 10% cost reduction and translates into 5 million circulars\nper week from a baseline of 50 million.\nThe Regional VPs responsible for store sales believe that the distribution of Sunday circulars to\nindividual homes is strongly correlated with sales. They will push back on any cuts in their\nindividual regions.\nThe industry standard for coverage (circulation divided by households in a given area) is\napproximately 65%. However, at this retailer, coverage levels in individual markets and\nindividual zip codes vary widely from this norm.\nFinally, the CFO is one of your executive sponsors and has set expectations for immediate cost\nreductions, as well as a longer-term sustainable plan to maintain Sunday coverage levels in the\nfuture.\nKey Information to Consider\n- Sunday circulation is purchased at the “market” level for each of 500 US markets. Each\nmarket is supported by hundreds of newspapers capable of distributing the Sunday circular.\nWhen buying coverage from a newspaper, a retailer typically selects the specific zip codes for\nwhich distribution is desired.\n- You have access to Sunday circulation data for the entire US that identifies the number of\ncirculars delivered by each particular newspaper to each zip code, and the cost of distribution.\nIn addition, you’ve been given population and demographic information for each zip code and\nmarket.\n- Over the past few years, circulation decisions have been driven by those regions and stores\nthat “scream the loudest” for additional circulation.\n- The retailer has a robust customer database captured from check and credit card data that\nidentifies where customers live and where they shop.\nKey Interview Question(s)\n- How can you address the CFO’s demand for immediate and longer-term cost reductions?\n- How would you identify which 5 million pieces to cut while being cognizant of the impact on\nsales?\nPossible Recommendations & Key Points/Issues Candidate Should Cover:\n- Question 1: “Quick Hits” followed by a rational approach to assigning circulation by market\n- Question 2: Overall Approach & Measurement\n- Quick Hits-Immediate Savings\n\n- Measure the productivity of the zip codes. Zip code metrics could include: high\ncoverage, far distance from the store, low sales per households, high advertising\nexpense/sales ratio, low sales/circulation ratio.\n- Create frequency distributions to evaluate the metrics. Eliminate coverage in the\nmost unproductive zip codes, particularly zip codes that are on the tail end of several\nof these metrics.\n- The RVP’s will be more likely to agree to cuts in zip codes where sales are already\nlow.\n- Longer-Term Coverage Determination Model\n- Prioritize markets based on quantifiable metrics that indicate how valuable/potentially\nvaluable they are to the retailer. Such metrics might include: sales per household,\ncompetition indicator, total sales (market size) and market growth.\n- Assign target coverage levels based on this value.\n- Within each market prioritize zip codes based on the value to the retailer.\n- Buy coverage with this prioritization as a guideline.\n- Implement a Sales Impact Tracking Mechanism\n- Monitor zip codes/markets where cuts have been made to see how sales are impacted\nCase Wrap-Up\n- Quick hits were identified and implemented first to start the ball rolling with savings. This\naccounted for around 15% of the overall reduction in Sunday circulation.\n- The longer-term approach involved a market scoring methodology that would help us assign\ntarget coverage levels to each market. With target coverage levels based on sales per\nhousehold, market potential, and competition, instead of perception, the team was able to\nidentify cuts that were justifiable. Understanding market and zip code priorities helped the\nteam identify the additional 85% savings.\n- The team worked with the client and an outside print media-buying vendor, to make specific\n(which newspaper?, how many copies?) recommendations by zip code and quantify the\nsavings.\n- Even though the target coverage levels reduced coverage significantly in some of the largest\nmarkets, the client moved forward and made the cuts since the scoring model showed that\nthese markets may not be as valuable as previously thought.\n- Sales tracking has just begun. So far the impact of the cuts has been minimal.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Parcel Delivery Network": "Parcel Delivery Network\nThe client is the largest package delivery service in Canada. During the past 30 years, the firm\nhas established a network that allows it to deliver parcels to \"every address in Canada\". Until\nlast year, competition had been non-existent and profits were very strong. Starting about 15\nmonths ago, a new company began parcel pickup and delivery to three (and only three) Canadian\ncities - Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver. Although overall parcel traffic has declined by only\n10% for our client, profits have declined by almost 30% from last year's number. Outline your\nhypothesis for the alarming decline in profitability.\nExplain what analytical measures you would use to diagnose the problem and where you would\ngather the data necessary to perform the diagnosis. What approach would you offer to our client\nfor the restoration of reasonable profits and what strategy would you employ to prevent further\ndeterioration of profits?\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n- The new entrant has a fleet of older semi-trailer trucks that run between the three cities. Our\nclient has a very new fleet (more efficient) that services all of Canada. The client's fleet mix\nhas been optimized such that efficiency and capacity utilization are high considering the\nnetwork of locations covered.\n- The new entrant charges approximately 50% less than our client for delivery between the\nthree cities that they cover.\n- Our client and the new entrant charge by the lb-mile. One pound carried one mile is a lb-mile\nSOLUTION STRUCTURE\nStart off with a profitability analysis to pinpoint where the problem lies. Then, use the 3 C’s to\nsee what about the market is causing the problem. Finally, take a look at the costs of this\nindustry: does one of these firms have an inherent advantage? Are certain customers better off\nthan others? This is a complex case, so take your time and keep digging.\nSOLUTION ANALYSIS\n- The new entrant has initiated service in the three markets where economies of scale are\npresent. Because a large number of packages move between these three cities, larger trucks\nand efficient distribution centers make such limited service very profitable.\n- A more important facet of this case is how the interviewee reaches this conclusion. He/she\nshould use a cost measure like $/lb-mile to explain that the major city routes have always\nsubsidized delivery to smaller cities and towns.\n- Realize also that our delivery to all addresses in Canada is a tremendous advantage to our\nclient. Businesses that ship to customers outside of the major cities cannot afford to lose our\nservice.\n- Employ a new pricing strategy that will increase charges for rural delivery. Note that this\nmay invite the new entrant to begin rural delivery.\n- Develop long-term contracts with major business clients who use our rural delivery capability.\nOffer a flat delivery rate only when the business agrees to use our client for rural and city\ndelivery.\n- Search for synergies with other companies that also deliver to rural areas (this client actually\npaired with several grocery/beverage/snack delivery companies in the most rural areas).",
  "Goizueta_2006_Charge-card Competition": "Charge-card Competition\nAmerican Express (Amex) is a consumer services company providing a variety of services to its\ncardholders. Its primary service is its well-known charge card, that enables “members” (i.e.,\ncardholders) to purchase goods and services from millions of merchants that accept the card.\nUnlike other credit cards, cardholders are required to pay off their accrued balances each month,\nand interest is not charged.\nRecently, Amex has faced strong competition from new credit cards entering the market. They\nhave considered dropping the $55 annual fee. What are the economics of such a decision, and\nshould they drop the fee or not?\nSOLUTION STRUCTURE\n- Determine how American Express makes money.\n- Evaluate the pros and cons of dropping the annual fee.\n- Explore options for replacement revenue.\n- Make a recommendation.\nRevenue Drivers:\n- $55 x the number of members (could round to $50 for simpler math).\n- Q: How many people have the American Express Card? A: What is your best estimate?\n- The number of cardholders is approximately 14 million (you can round to either 10 or 20 to\nsimplify the math).\n- No additional revenues from consumers, since balances are paid monthly. (Amex doesn’t\nenforce late fees)\n- 1% merchant fees for all transactions from merchants honoring the Amex card.\n- Est. annual transactions are $1,000.00 per cardholder. ($1,000 x 1% x 10mm = $100 million)\nIssues to be addressed:\nIf the annual; fee is dropped, Amex loses $55 x number of cardholders.\nAmex would have to generate new or additional revenues to overcome the loss of annual-fee\nrevenue.\nUsing a conservative estimate, lost revenue will be 10mm x 55 = $550 million.\nQ: Will consumer spending increase sufficiently to generate merchant-transaction revenue?\nA: Not likely, since cardholders must still pay-off balances at the end of the month.\nTherefore, must increase number of cardholders to increase merchant-transaction revenue.\nQ: Is it possible to sufficiently increase the number of cardholders? A: How would YOU\nestimate this?\n- The average annual transaction revenues are $1,000 x 1% = $10 per member.\n- Therefore, the number of new customers required to overcome the revenue loss would be\n550mm/10 = 55 million\n- Now, is it possible for Amex to gain 55 million new members this year? Not likely, is it!\n- Also possible to raise transaction fees: more revenues, but must address consequences for\nvendor relations.\n\nQ: Does Amex enforce late fees? A: No, but most credit cards charge $20 - $25 for late\npayments.\nShould Amex charge interest and allow card-members to hold a balance?\n- Would the new revenues from interest offset losses from dropping the annual fee? Depends\non rate of interest and average balance. Q: What is the average APR and average monthly\nbalance? A: You tell me. (use 15% and $500)\n- If average balance = $500 at ~10% APR = $50 per member x 10 million members = $500\nmillion annually.\nRecommendations\n- Based on economic analysis, don’t drop the fee. It is difficult to replace the lost revenue.\n- While some options exist (i.e., charging interest on balances) the consequences should be\nexplored.\n- Amex could issue an interest-driven credit card under a new brand name (in fact, Amex did so\nwith the Optima card).\nSOLUTION ANALYSIS\n- The client specifically inquires about the economics of ending the annual fee. Good answers\nshould focus on this issue, and should provide recommendations based on the analysis. Good\nanswers should explore the issue of rival credit cards entering the market, how their product\noffering is similar or different from the American Express card, and the strengths and\nweaknesses of American Express’s position. Alternative revenues should be explored. One\noption is charging interest and allowing cardholders to hold a balance. Answers should\naddress how this would this affect the AMEX brand, i.e., the consequences of becoming a just\nanother ordinary credit card. Another is enforcing late fees, or raising merchant fees. The\nconsequences of these should be addressed also.\n- Outstanding answers should additionally explore the effects of competition among credit\ncards for revenues, and recommend how Amex could increase revenues without dropping the\n$55 fee. For example, comment on the quality of new members acquired, since competition\nis forcing many credit card companies to issue cards to riskier consumers.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Oil-drilling Investment": "Oil-drilling Investment\nThe year is 1950. You are Standard Oil Company of New Jersey (now known as ExxonMobil),\na company that excels in the refining and marketing of petroleum products. The success of your\ncompany depends, in part, on your ability to maintain adequate levels of petroleum supply.\nFollowing national energy shortages experienced during WWII, it is clear to your company that\nsecuring a source of foreign oil is key to maintaining your supply, and hence your market share.\nYou have been approached, separately, by two other petroleum companies to enter into joint\nventures. One company, Gulf, is interested in establishing drilling rights to a large field located\nin the small Arabian-peninsula nation of Kuwait. They have offered you a large stake in the\nventure. A second oil company, Royal Dutch/Shell, has offered you an equally large stake in a\nventure to establish drilling rights to a large field located on the border of Iran and Iraq. You do\nnot have the resources to enter into both ventures. Which one do you choose and why?\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nTo some of the interviewee’s questions, reply with “Explain how the answer to your question\nwould determine which partner is preferable.”\nSome variables and information to consider when comparing Kuwait vs. Iraq\n- Political stability and risk (domestic politics) – both areas, as of 1950, are unstable states.\nKuwait’s government is currently more stable, but the head of state is very old.\n- Political stability and risk (International) -- Kuwait does not have as many border disputes as\nIraq, and both have a tradition of working with foreign developers. Kuwait invited developers\ninto the country around 1912.\n- Legal/Regulatory environment: Legal risk due to market instability (legal foundation to\nenforce contracts and protect investments) – both areas have good legal systems, but law is\ndependent on the stability of the government. Risk is considerable. Few regulations exist in\neither country.\n- Socio-cultural environment – are skilled workers available or will they be imported? In both\ncountries, skilled labor is unavailable. Both countries are in favor of foreign oil development,\nbut there exist elements against the presence of foreigners, and against perceived economic\nexploitation.\n- Infrastructure (Ability to get product to market) – Both countries have significant access to\nports and newly developed pipelines (that cross neighboring country’s soil)\n- Infrastructure (Ability to extract oil) – This is the most significant cost to you, since the\ninfrastructure does not naturally grow in the desert. Oil does, but you’ll have to find it.\n- Human Resources and Management Talent – your company has the talent, but lacks\nexperience in the Middle East.\n- Other options – can you go it alone? – You need oil, where else would you develop it? The\ncosts and risks are too prohibitive – assume a joint venture/strategic alliance is necessary.\nRDS vs. Gulf\nBoth have experience in the Middle East. Both companies are comparable in every way, but\nRDS is much bigger, and has its market focus in Asia and Europe. Gulf is a US company\nfocused in the US and Europe. Both seek a long-term partnership. RDS has experience with\njoint ventures (in Asia), both good and bad.\n\nSOLUTION STRUCTURE\nGood answers will outline the conditions that make a joint venture workable. There is little\ninformation from which to base a rational choice, so the answer matters little. Instead, focus on\ndefining decision rules.\nSOLUTION ANALYSIS\n- What are your strategic objectives?\n- What are the variables affecting the decision?\n- Determine the decision rule for whether to go or not go.\n- Examine and compare the offers: which of your objectives are fulfilled or not?\n- What are the consequences of joining; what are the consequences of not joining?\n- Provide implementation and exit strategies, and other conditional provisions.",

Your client is also confident the business fundamentals are\nvery sound. The problem they face is that their stock price has been seriously affected by a\nrecent accounting scandal. Although the accounting problems have been cleared up, investors\nare wary.\nIn its membership business, your client markets memberships in shopping, travel, auto, credit\nprotection, and other personal services. It does so by off-branding its products to banks, credit\nunions, credit cards, clubs, and many other organizations. Its primary source of revenues in this\nbusiness is membership fees. Its distribution channels are direct mail, telemarketing, the Internet,\nand America Online. The Interactive division also operates a number of E-commerce sites that\ngenerate memberships, and some advertising dollars. Management has placed a number of\nimportant initiatives on hold due to lack of financial resources, and due to a lack of management\nfocus resulting from recent problems.\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n- The subsidiaries are recent acquisitions, most within the last two years.\n- The company as a whole formed as the result of a merger between two equal firms.\n- The business fundamentals are very sound; but investors may not believe the numbers.\n- The core business is memberships (selling the auto, travel, shopping, etc, service products).\n- The core competency is effectively leveraging subsidiaries and marketing partners for cross-\nmarketing opportunities to sell memberships; these are yet untapped due to diversion of\nmanagement focus.\n- There is competition within sub-categories (i.e., your client competes with AAA for auto\nclubs services) but little competition at the scale at which the client operates; there are few\nplayers in the national market.\n- Prices of membership services are stable (recent price increases did not affect membership\nflow).\n- Membership flows (how many people join or quit) have remained constant; memberships are\nincreasing rapidly.\n- The current situation is such that the individual pieces of the firm are more valuable than the\nfirm as a whole. i.e., the firm is currently undervalued.

The market (these days) rewards Internet\nbased companies, but has failed to perceive the value in your client’s interactive and software\ndivisions.

Quality?, Consumers?\nA: Lower quality than Frank’s two consumer segments: Those who do a lot of home cooking and\nuse only Frank's or Joe's, and those who just stop in and pick up a block of cheese.\nWhy have we been discounting? Are we losing our loyal customers?\nA: No. We're just under a lot of pressure from the retailer to match prices.\nIssues:\nDue to competitive pressure from private label, Frank and Joe have taken periodic price\nreductions. This has hurt their margins and may also cause them to lose their loyal customers\n(and lose their high-quality brand image).\nRecommendations:\n- Maintain premium price levels for Frank's current line of high quality cheese.\n\n- Manufacture a lower cost product under a different brand name to compete with private label\nbrands.\n- Utilize advertising revenues to communicate the benefit of using high quality cheese.",

Target segment is lower to middle income families.\n- Market share is 10%. Revenue drivers are subscriptions and advertising. The breakdown is\n50% / 50%.\n- Usually, in a newspaper company, advertising is the major source of revenue. Subscriptions\nare not that much since the market in NYC is very competitive. It is dominated by lots of\nother big firms such as the New York Times, etc. Consequently, advertising prices are very\ncompetitive and do not generate lots of revenue in the subsidiary. (Big firms do not want to\nadvertise in newspaper that has little market share).\nMarket condition in NYC:\n- Very competitive, very hard to differentiate since there are lots of competitors and excess\ncapacity. This is adversely affecting pricing and profitability in the market.\nSOLUTION ANALYSIS\nThe financial value of the subsidiary is negative. However, lots of companies in New York City,\nincluding the NY Times, are trying to enter suburban areas of NY because they are very\nprofitable. Therefore, this company (Daily News) is trying to enter the NYC market to distract\nthe attention of those companies that try to enter its market, as well as signal that if the NYC\nnewspapers try to grab share in the suburban area, Daily News could do the same thing in NYC.\nThe value of the subsidiary is its strategic value.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Petroleum-company Suppliers": "Petroleum-company Suppliers\nA large oil and gas company that has operations worldwide is divided into three business\nsegments: upstream, downstream, and chemicals. Upstream involves drilling and extracting oil,\ndownstream is refining the product into gas and selling it at stations, and chemicals is producing\npetroleum-based products. The upstream business segment is divided into approximately 30\ncompanies worldwide that fall under the parent company's umbrella of businesses. These\ncompanies use numerous suppliers and the parent company would like to cut supplier spending\nand, in particular, the parent company would like to know whether they are using the cheapest\nsuppliers in all cases.\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n- The parent company has upstream companies in four regions: Asia, Europe, the U.S., and\nAfrica\n- There are three suppliers that have a presence in all four regions (companies A, B, and C)\n- The upstream companies and the top two low cost suppliers in each region are:\nAsia - 10 upstream companies, 4 suppliers, rankings: A, B\nAfrica - 4 upstream companies, 4 suppliers rankings: A, B\nEurope - 10 upstream companies, 6 suppliers, rankings: B, C\nU.S. - 6 upstream companies, 8 suppliers rankings: C, B\nSOLUTION STRUCTURE\nA good way of attacking this case is to find out where the parent company has upstream\noperations geographically and then analyze the suppliers in each region and across the regions.\nDuring an actual interview, the case interviewer liked this approach and allowed me to\nconcentrate on one type of supplier in particular, the suppliers of drilling equipment.\nLike all other cases, there is no one answer. Instead you should mention several things:\n- Look at the strengths of each supplier (do they have specific equipment that gives them an\nadvantage even though they may not be low cost)\n- Will the suppliers reduce their prices if the parent company offers a larger volume of business\nor a sole-sourcing agreement, and do the suppliers have the resources for a larger volume\n- If A is chosen as sole supplier to the 10 companies in Asia and C for the 6 in the U.S., can you\ntransfer the cost cutting ideas between the two companies to receive further cost reductions?",

  "Goizueta_2006_Telecommunications Product-portfolio": "Telecommunications Product-portfolio\nA Baby Bell company is interested in diversifying into other areas besides telecommunications.\nThey are considering entering the market for electronic home security systems. Would you\nrecommend that they do so?\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n- The company is a holding company. The company has previously made unsuccessful forays\ninto software and into real estate.\n- The home security industry is highly fragmented. The top five players in the industry generate\nless than 4% of the total industry revenues. This implies that the industry largely consists of\nsmall, regional companies.\n- 10% of all residences currently own an electronic security system.\n- This is in some sense a razor and razor blade sort of business. The economics are:\nItem Retail price Cost/Margin\nEquipment & Installation $500-$1500 0-10% margin\nMonthly service $20/month $5/month\n- What strengths/competencies of the Baby Bell company are useful in this market?\n- Installation expertise\n- Operator services\n- Transmission system (phone lines)\n- It turns out that the \"expensive home\" segment of this market is saturated. Growth has been\nslow in recent years.\n- Price sensitivity is unknown in \"moderate-priced home\" segment.\nSOLUTION STRUCTURE\nUse an industry attractiveness framework, such as Porter’s Five Forces, to determine whether\nthis is a business you want to be in, or at least to determine what kind of returns you can expect\nto achieve. Then, use the value chain to look at where value is added in the home security\nbusiness. Another possibility is a basic 3 C’s to analyze the market potential. Finally, once you\nfeel you understand the market, determine if the core competencies of the Baby Bell are likely to\nmatch the demands of the home security market. The conclusion is that this business is a\nreasonably good fit for the company, but that more market research needs to be done to assess\nthe growth and profit potential of each segment of the market.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Glass Investment": "Glass Investment\nA producer of glass containers is considering making a $1 million investment to upgrade some\nprocess equipment. Would you recommend that they do so?\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n- This company has only one, albeit large, facility. There are quite a few other glass producers.\n- Margins and profits of the entire industry have been eroding for several years.\n- There has been and continues to be some cannibalization by plastic and metals. However,\nglass remains the material of choice for many applications, especially food products.\n- The main input material, sand, is inexpensive and plentiful.\n- Some of this company's competitors have already made a similar upgrade to their own process\nequipment\nSOLUTION STRUCTURE\nStart with a simple cost/benefit analysis. Look at the potential benefits from upgrading the\nequipment and compare that to the $1 million cost. To look at the benefits, consider the Porter\nFive Forces framework to look at likely returns from the industry. Remember that future cash\nflows from this investment must be discounted at the company’s cost of capital.\nSOLUTION ANALYSIS\n- The key insight in this case is to recognize the high competitive intensity in this industry. The\nprofit potential, at least in the short term, appears poor.\n- Given the fact that there are too many players and too little profit, some consolidation and/or\nexit of some companies from the industry appears inevitable. This company must decide\nwhether it is worth it to try to ride out this shakeout.\n- At least in the short term, the return on the $1 million investment will likely not be adequate\nto justify making it. However, one interesting possible justification for making the investment\nmight be to \"dress up\" the company in order to sell it",
  "Goizueta_2006_Auto-parts Business-entry": "Auto-parts Business-entry\nA specialty ceramic materials firm has decided to enter the automotive parts supply business.\nThey have developed new ceramic engine components that when used in a standard internal\ncombustion engine will increase fuel mileage by 20%, decrease pollution by 30%, and improve\nlongevity by 20%. Your client wants to know how to proceed.\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nThere is quite a bit of internal rivalry in the automotive parts business. This has driven profit\nmargins down to a minimum level. Buyer power is quite concentrated with the big three\nautomakers coming first, then the large engine manufacturers, and then possibly the large\nautomotive supply centers. There are very few supply issues as the components for ceramics are\neasily found. New entrants should not be an issue because the formulation for our product is a\nmix of patented materials and processes. Substitutes are the traditional steel components.\nProfitability analysis shows that our components costs $500 per engine set, while traditional steel\ncomponents costs $50 per engine set.\nSOLUTION STRUCTURE\nThe first place to start is with an industry analysis, perhaps using Porter’s 5 Forces to get an\nunderstanding of the automotive parts business. From there, look at the new venture’s\nprofitability and finally a marketing plan:\n- The best place to determine cost benefit is on miles per gallon savings. For example, for a 30-\nmpg car, the new components will get 36 mpg. The average person drives 12,000 miles per\nyear, which is 400 gallons with the old components and 333 gallons with the ceramics. At\n$1.25 per gallon, this is an $83 dollar a year savings. It will take the average driver over 5\nyears to save the extra $450.\n- However, the average semi-truck will drive over 100,000 miles per year. At 10 mpg to 12\nmpg the annual savings are over $2,000.\nThe next step is how to go to market. This company lacks any automotive distribution network\nor sales force. The company should form a joint venture for distribution with a current\nautomotive parts supply company.",

Is it possible\nand how would you achieve this?\nInformation to be given if asked:\n- ROIC Definition\n- ROIC is Return on Invested Capital. This can be achieved by growing the profits of\nthe firm and/or by decreasing the invested capital.\n- There are firms in the industry that have 20-30% ROIC. Hence the client’s target\nlooks achievable.\n- Customers\n- Client has 30% customers in Europe, 10% in Asia, 50% in North America and 10% in\nROW.\n- The client has 2 types of products – Standard (almost a commodity) and Engineered\n(designed specifically for the client).\n- The standard products are getting commoditized, hence have significant price\npressure.\n- The engineered products have good margins in the 1st year and then the margins\ndecrease in subsequent 3-4 years.\n- The client has 30,000 SKUs in their product portfolio.\n- The industries that the client serves are as follows:\nIndustry % of Revenues Standard product Engineered product\nAutomotive 55% 65% 35%\nElectronics 25% 45% 55%\nConstruction 10% 75% 25%\nOthers 10% 70% 30%\nNOTE: The interviewee should recognize the following by now based on the\nCustomer Information\n- Client % revenues from Electronics industry are quite low and that industry has the\nhighest % of Engineered\n- products. The client should focus more closely on that industry.\n- Engineered products offer much higher margins.\n- 30,000 SKU seem like a lot, and should address that in the case as well. There will be\ninterdependencies among these products.\n- Competitive Landscape\n- This is a highly fragmented industry with 20,000 competitors.\n- Investment/Cost\n- There are integration issues among the small companies under the client umbrella.\nThe issues pertain to decentralized sourcing, sales staff and back office operations.\nThese should be centralized to decrease cost (economies of scale) and improve\ncoordination.\n- The product portfolio needs to be optimized. Evaluate profitability of each product\nalong with its interdependency, i.e. its importance in a product portfolio supplied to\n\nimportant clients. Evaluate profitability of each client as well. Suggest using\ndatabases for this analysis.\n- Divest assets pertaining to certain non-profitable low volume standard products to\ndecrease capital investment. If these components are still needed for a client portfolio\ninvestigate outsourcing their production and having exclusive contracts to maintain\nquality.\n- Evaluate the capacity utilization and supply chain for the 50 plants. Decrease\ninvestment if possible.\nSolution:\nThe client can increase the ROIC from 10% to 20% by the following initiatives:\n- Optimize product mix while keeping product interdependencies in mind\n- Sell more engineered products by growing business in electronics industry\n- Decrease cost by improving the internal integration",

Now, 14 years later,\nthe product has developed a loyal following, but has yet to break wide open.\nCurrent users of the main product lines include professionals in the petroleum industry, financial\nmarkets, manufacturing, health care, academia, and others.\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n- Q: How large is the market? A: We don’t know.

Key difference: cheaper, less sophisticated\nproducts.\n- What is the price of the product? Software price is generally irrelevant. End-users are not as\nprice sensitive.\n- Company costs are not important. The company is very lean and well managed from a cost\nperspective.\n- Revenues were $10MM in the last fiscal year, but so what? The company is profitable and\ngrowing, just not fast enough.\n- Current distribution is through resellers – people call them to order the product (resellers sell a\nlarge variety)\n- Most software is sold direct to customers who contact the firm. These are current users\npurchasing up-grades, additional site licenses for co-workers, or people who’ve seen what the\nproduct can do for them.\n- Many new leads come from trade shows, direct mail, and print ads in technical journals.\nThese programs are effective but small.\n- Q: Who are the users? A: We don’t really know, since very little information is kept on\nbuyers.\nSolution Structure\n- Determine a mission – what is the purpose of this engagement/case? To help increase product\nsales for the client.\n- Define the problem and analyze why.\n- Examine target segment – who uses the product, who isn’t but should use the product?\n- Analyze the product – who would use it and why? What are the substitutes and competition?\n\n- Examine channels of distribution.\nSOLUTION ANALYSIS\nThe key issue is the means of selling the product. The current channels of distribution are not\nadequate to sell the product. Good answers should identify that the product is very complex,\ndifficult to use, but also a very powerful tool for users in specific industries. Therefore, the\nmarketing program must educate end-users. Good answers will explore, then provide\nrecommendations to improve channel performance. Outstanding answers may provide specific\nrecommendations for joint ventures.\nCritical insight: How large is the market? Good answers should provide what-if scenarios for\nvarious possibilities, i.e., if the key industries have been reached but on a small scale, marketing\nefforts should focus on finding new users who match current user profiles. But if key industry\nsegments have yet to be identified, perhaps marketing programs should focus on introducing the\nproduct to new segments of users.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Cutting-tool International-expansion": "Cutting-tool International-expansion\nA large American cutting tool manufacturer who has the dominant market share in the US, but\nminimal presence in other parts of the world, is considering entering the German market. They\nbelieve the German market could be attractive because of the large industrial base. How should\nthey enter?\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n- The cutting tools that this company manufactures are many different types of drill bits that go\nonto machine tools, and are used in metal working applications - from machine shops to auto\nmanufacturers, and many other industrial applications.\n- The business is divided between standard parts, and custom-designed parts for specific\napplications. The standard pieces are sold through distributors and direct through a sales\nforce, and the custom designed pieces are sold through a direct salesforce. The custom-\ndesigned pieces are much more profitable than the standard pieces, and our client is interested\nin this market.\n- (At the time of this case) Germany is a growing market for cutting tools, due to a strong\nindustrial base, especially in heavy industries where there is the possibility to sell many\ncustom designed pieces in large volumes to customers.\n- Germany appears attractive because it could provide a foothold to enter the rest of Europe,\nwhere again our client has a negligible presence. France and Italy also appear to be attractive\nmarkets, and the experience gained in Germany with European manufacturers could help to\nestablish a European name for the company.\n- There are about ten competitors in this market, all German, none of which has more than a\ntwenty percent market share. There isn’t a lot of movement among the competitors in terms of\nstealing share from each other. They are all basically growing along with the growth of the\nmarket in general.\n- Some of the competitors are stronger in the custom designed tools and other competitors are\nstronger in the standard pieces. All of the competitors have both direct and indirect\nsalesforces.\n- Each of the competitors has a very strong relationship with their customers. The loyalty of\nthe customers is so strong that the cutting tool firms send salespeople to customers of\ncompetitors every day for years in a row before winning the account. Once a supplier has\nestablished a relationship with the customer the supplier can be almost assured of a cash\nstream over a period of years. This makes the cost of acquisition of new customers extremely\nhigh.\nSOLUTION STRUCTURE\nThis case is adaptable to a few frameworks; you could try using Five Forces, but don’t get locked\ninto running through all five. Another approach you could use is to use a hybrid of the 3 C’s and\n4 P’s.\nSOLUTION ANALYSIS\n- Because the direct salesforce is the key to winning customers, and the strategic focus of our\nclient, our client could not enter through distributors. On the other hand, they could not hope\n\nto enter with their own direct salesforce because of the prohibitively expensive and long\ncustomer acquisition process.\n- They established a joint venture with a company that had a strong customer base, but did not\nhave superior engineering capabilities to custom design pieces.",
  "Goizueta_2006_Contract-manufacturing product-portfolio": "Contract-manufacturing product-portfolio\nMPL is a seven-year old contract-manufacturing firm located in Ithaca, New York. The founder\nand President, Shane French, has found a niche in the contract manufacturing space by providing\nhis customers highly customized service, particularly with respect to production schedules and\nsmall lot sizes. Contract manufacturing is, for example, placing microelectronics on printed\ncircuit boards (a.k.a. motherboards) for such components as computers, lasers, and electronic\nitems. Currently, customers provide MPL with parts inventory, and MPL performs the assembly.\nFrench investigated the field and is considering offering turnkey solutions. That is, providing\nready-made boards for clients (based on customer specifications). This would require an\ninvestment in inventory, but MPL could command a 20% mark-up on parts alone. This is how\nmany contract manufacturing firms grow revenues. Should MPL offer turnkey solutions?\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n- The competitive environment is very fragmented in the niche portion of the industry.\n- MPL has been profitable each year, growing 30% annually.\n- MPL has very little debt, and owns all its equipment ($30,000 bank loan for equipment).\n- Customer relationships are critical: MPL has a solid customer base.\n- MPL has a customer base of about 10 firms = 90% of its business is from repeat customers.\n- Relationships are not steady – client needs vary from time to time, job sizes vary considerably.\n- Business is strong but variable; customer demand comes and goes in waves, unpredictable.\n- Offering turnkey solutions would not smooth the production cycle.\n- MPL specializes in filling niche needs; small lot sizes, unusual delivery schedules.\n- MPL is currently not seeking new clients, lacks the capacity to service new clients.\n- MPL lacks the resources (skills) to forecast demand.\n- There is not enough skilled labor in the area to increase capacity – which is why they’re\nturning customers away.\n- Offering turnkey solutions would require an increase in capacity.\n- Parts supplies are plentiful; discounts are possible for bulk purchases.\nSOLUTION STRUCTURE\n- Determine a decision rule.\n- Identify the key factors for consideration.\n- Investigate the pros and cons of these factors.\n- Make a recommendation.\nSOLUTION ANALYSIS\nGood answers should uncover:\n- Advantages of turnkey: more $, more customers.\n- Disadvantages: requires greater capacity, would not smooth operational cycle (demand is\nhighly variable), large investment in inventory is financially unfeasible (payback would only\noccur over time), MPL lacks scale.\n- Identify steps to mitigate demand issues.\n- Increasing in capacity is a “step” function, not linear.\n- Discuss issue of resources (skilled labor).",

  "Goizueta_2006_Suntan-lotion Sales": "Suntan-lotion Sales\nYour client is a start-up venture in Southern California. They market a single tanning lotion\nproduct to beach-goers from San Diego to Los Angeles. Although sales volume is large, it has\nnot reached anticipated levels. You have been hired to find out why, and what can they do about\nthis problem. This is the company’s second summer in business.\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nAnswer only if directly asked, or answer “What do you think?” or “Why is that important?”\nWhy start the business?\n- They have conducted extensive market research and have found that their product should do\nquite well.\n- There are currently no other products targeting the Hawaiian Cocoa butter segment.\n- The product did quite well with consumers in focus groups that were conducted prior to\nlaunch.\n- These focus groups are representative of the target market, and indicate a real market need for\nthis product.\n- The goal was to attain a 5 percent market share – sales at this level would result in\nprofitability.\nTell me about their operation\n- The operation is three people – partners. They handle marketing (including distribution) and\nfinances. Production is out-sourced to a local manufacturer that is reliable and cheap.\nTell me about the market\n- The market is quite fragmented, with no dominant player. Coppertone, the leading brand, has\na 15% market share.\n- There are at least 10 different brands competing in several lotion/oil sub-categories.\nTell me about their pricing and positioning\n- The target market is people who purchase sun-tanning products at the beach.\n- The positioning is Hawaiian cocoa butter. This is a premium product, and is priced in the\nmiddle of the high-end.\n- Coppertone, a more expensive brand, is the leading seller.\n- Tell me About Distribution\n- The product is sold exclusively at bungalows – proprietor owned and operated walk-up shacks\non the beach that typically sell soda, snacks, and basic products to beach goers.\n- The product sits on the shelf, and buyers see it and select it. There are no additional shelf\npromotions.\n- One partner drives up and down the beaches refilling stock.\n- These bungalows do not charge slotting fees, while drug stores and grocery stores do.\n- Their lack of sophistication makes little opportunity to provide incentives to have them push\nthe product.\n\nTell me about promotions\n- Brand awareness was built through sponsorship of beach volleyball tournaments. There are\nno other promotions.\n- All signs, including follow-up market research, indicate this has been successful.\nHow have they been doing?\n- The 5% market share goal was reached, but estimates projected at least 7%.\n- They sell out of their product at each location the product is available. In fact, the product\nsells very well.\n- The firm is very profitable, but could be more so if sales attained projected levels.\nSOLUTION ANALYSIS\nThis tests your detective abilities. The answer is small and specific – can you find it? Use the 4\nP’s, and don’t give up so easily. Ask, what are the conditions necessary for high sales?\n(1) There must be buyers for the product,\n(2) the price must be right,\n(3) the product must be available.\nIn this case, the product was not available so people were not buying it. Solution? Make it\navailable. Problem solved. The key to this problem is distribution. Remember that this is a\nprofitable firm. Their problem is not economics, segmentation, competition, price, promotions,\nor the product – it’s distribution. Specifically, it is the delivery schedule of the product. The\nproduct sells out at each location, but it is some time before the shelves are re-filled. An easy\nsolution is to re-fill and check the bungalows more frequently. Future considerations may entail\na look at promotions and greater distribution, but for now the client is only interested in one\nproblem: meeting projected sales volume.",
  "Goizueta_2006_New Money or No Money? (McKinsey)": "New Money or No Money? (McKinsey)\nOur client is the CEO of a major regional bank. The bank owns a data processing company.\nRecently the president of the data processing company asked our client to invest $100 million in\nnew processing technology for the firm. The president felt that this investment would make\nthem much more competitive. At this time our client approached us and said “$100 million is a\nlot of money. Should I do this?”\nIf you were leading the engagement team working with this client, how would you design the\nstudy? What issues would you want to examine?\nComments\nQuestion number one, before coming up with a hypothesis, should be “what’s a data processing\nfirm?” Turns out they mostly process checks for small banks within the region. The president\nbelieves they can gain a greater share of these small banks with the new investment. We know\nfrom reading the newspaper that small banks are disappearing so immediately we have to be\nconcerned about the customer base. Work this into a hypothesis.\nMy hypothesis was that this would be a bad idea because of concerns about the customer base.\nThis question would ultimately lead to a basic NPV analysis. But, to reasonably determine the\ncash flows we have to know more about the three C’s: customers, competition, and company.\nIt turned out that the customer base was shriveling, that the competitors for the smaller number\nof banks were huge and low, low cost providers, and that the companies cost structure and\nparticular strengths would keep them from being competitive with larger players like TRW and\nEquifax no matter how much they invested in technology.\nRecommendation: don’t spend the $100 million, sell the data processing firm."
