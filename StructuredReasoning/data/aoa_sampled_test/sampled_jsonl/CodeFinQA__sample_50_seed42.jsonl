"gain or loss on ownership change in map results from contributions to map of certain environmental capital expenditures and leased property acquisitions funded by marathon and ashland . in accordance with map 2019s limited liability company agreement , in certain instances , environmental capital expenditures and acquisitions of leased properties are funded by the original contributor of the assets , but no change in ownership interest may result from these contributions . an excess of ashland funded improvements over marathon funded improvements results in a net gain and an excess of marathon funded improvements over ashland funded improvements results in a net loss . cost of revenues increased by $ 5.822 billion in 2004 from 2003 and by $ 6.040 billion in 2003 from 2002 . the increases are primarily in the rm&t segment and result from higher acquisition costs for crude oil , refined products , refinery charge and blend feedstocks and increased manufacturing expenses . selling , general and administrative expenses increased by $ 105 million in 2004 from 2003 and by $ 97 million in 2003 from 2002 . the increase in 2004 was primarily due to increased stock-based compensation and higher costs associated with business transformation and outsourcing . our 2004 results were also impacted by start-up costs associated with the lng project in equatorial guinea and the increased cost of complying with governmental regulations . the increase in 2003 was primarily due to increased employee benefit expenses ( caused by increased pension expense resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions and a decrease in realized returns on plan assets ) and other employee related costs . additionally , during 2003 , we recorded a charge of $ 24 million related to organizational and business process changes . inventory market valuation reserve ( 2018 2018imv 2019 2019 ) is established to reduce the cost basis of inventories to current market value . generally , we will establish an imv reserve when crude oil prices fall below $ 22 per barrel . the 2002 results of operations include credits to income from operations of $ 71 million , reversing the imv reserve at december 31 , 2001 . net interest and other financial costs decreased by $ 25 million in 2004 from 2003 and by $ 82 million in 2003 from 2002 . the decrease in 2004 is primarily due to an increase in interest income . the decrease in 2003 is primarily due to an increase in capitalized interest related to increased long-term construction projects , the favorable effect of interest rate swaps , the favorable effect of a reduction in interest on tax deficiencies and increased interest income on investments . additionally , included in net interest and other financing costs are foreign currency gains of $ 9 million , $ 13 million and $ 8 million for 2004 , 2003 and 2002 . loss from early extinguishment of debt in 2002 was attributable to the retirement of $ 337 million aggregate principal amount of debt , resulting in a loss of $ 53 million . minority interest in income of map , which represents ashland 2019s 38 percent ownership interest , increased by $ 230 million in 2004 from 2003 and by $ 129 million in 2003 from 2002 . map income was higher in 2004 compared to 2003 and in 2003 compared to 2002 as discussed below in the rm&t segment . minority interest in loss of equatorial guinea lng holdings limited , which represents gepetrol 2019s 25 percent ownership interest , was $ 7 million in 2004 , primarily resulting from gepetrol 2019s share of start-up costs associated with the lng project in equatorial guinea . provision for income taxes increased by $ 143 million in 2004 from 2003 and by $ 215 million in 2003 from 2002 , primarily due to $ 388 million and $ 720 million increases in income before income taxes . the effective tax rate for 2004 was 36.6 percent compared to 36.6 percent and 42.1 percent for 2003 and 2002 . the higher rate in 2002 was due to the united kingdom enactment of a supplementary 10 percent tax on profits from the north sea oil and gas production , retroactively effective to april 17 , 2002 . in 2002 , we recognized a one-time noncash deferred tax adjustment of $ 61 million as a result of the rate increase . the following is an analysis of the effective tax rate for the periods presented: .\n\n|  | 2004 | 2003 |

{"question": "the pretax pension expenses that reduced primarily due to the amortization impact of the favorable 2009 investment returns as compared with the expected long-term return assumption resulted in how much of a decreased expense from 2009 to 2010 , in millions?", "answer": "76", "task": "CodeFinQA", "context": "investment policy , which is described more fully in note 15 employee benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report . we calculate the expense associated with the pension plan and the assumptions and methods that we use include a policy of reflecting trust assets at their fair market value . on an annual basis , we review the actuarial assumptions related to the pension plan , including the discount rate , the rate of compensation increase and the expected return on plan assets . the discount rate and compensation increase assumptions do not significantly affect pension expense . however , the expected long-term return on assets assumption does significantly affect pension expense . our expected long- term return on plan assets for determining net periodic pension expense has been 8.25% ( 8.25 % ) for the past three years . the expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption established by considering historical and anticipated returns of the asset classes invested in by the pension plan and the allocation strategy currently in place among those classes . while this analysis gives appropriate consideration to recent asset performance and historical returns , the assumption represents a long-term prospective return . we review this assumption at each measurement date and adjust it if warranted . for purposes of setting and reviewing this assumption , 201clong- term 201d refers to the period over which the plan 2019s projected benefit obligation will be disbursed . while year-to-year annual returns can vary significantly ( rates of return for the reporting years of 2009 , 2008 , and 2007 were +20.61% ( +20.61 % ) , -32.91% ( -32.91 % ) , and +7.57% ( +7.57 % ) , respectively ) , the assumption represents our estimate of long-term average prospective returns . our selection process references certain historical data and the current environment , but primarily utilizes qualitative judgment regarding future return expectations . recent annual returns may differ but , recognizing the volatility and unpredictability of investment returns , we generally do not change the assumption unless we modify our investment strategy or identify events that would alter our expectations of future returns . to evaluate the continued reasonableness of our assumption , we examine a variety of viewpoints and data . various studies have shown that portfolios comprised primarily of us equity securities have returned approximately 10% ( 10 % ) over long periods of time , while us debt securities have returned approximately 6% ( 6 % ) annually over long periods . application of these historical returns to the plan 2019s allocation of equities and bonds produces a result between 8% ( 8 % ) and 8.5% ( 8.5 % ) and is one point of reference , among many other factors , that is taken into consideration . we also examine the plan 2019s actual historical returns over various periods . recent experience is considered in our evaluation with appropriate consideration that , especially for short time periods , recent returns are not reliable indicators of future returns , and in many cases low returns in recent time periods are followed by higher returns in future periods ( and vice versa ) . acknowledging the potentially wide range for this assumption , we also annually examine the assumption used by other companies with similar pension investment strategies , so that we can ascertain whether our determinations markedly differ from other observers . in all cases , however , this data simply informs our process , which places the greatest emphasis on our qualitative judgment of future investment returns , given the conditions existing at each annual measurement date . the expected long-term return on plan assets for determining net periodic pension cost for 2009 was 8.25% ( 8.25 % ) , unchanged from 2008 . during 2010 , we intend to decrease the midpoint of the plan 2019s target allocation range for equities by approximately five percentage points . as a result of this change and taking into account all other factors described above , pnc will change the expected long-term return on plan assets to 8.00% ( 8.00 % ) for determining net periodic pension cost for 2010 . under current accounting rules , the difference between expected long-term returns and actual returns is accumulated and amortized to pension expense over future periods . each one percentage point difference in actual return compared with our expected return causes expense in subsequent years to change by up to $ 8 million as the impact is amortized into results of operations . the table below reflects the estimated effects on pension expense of certain changes in annual assumptions , using 2010 estimated expense as a baseline . change in assumption ( a ) estimated increase to 2010 pension expense ( in millions ) .\n\n| Change in Assumption(a) | EstimatedIncrease to 2010PensionExpense(Inmillions) |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| .5% decrease in discount rate | $10 |\n| .5% decrease in expected long-term return on assets | $18 |\n| .5% increase in compensation rate | $3 |\n\n( a ) the impact is the effect of changing the specified assumption while holding all other assumptions constant . we currently estimate a pretax pension expense of $ 41 million in 2010 compared with pretax expense of $ 117 million in 2009 . this year-over-year reduction was primarily due to the amortization impact of the favorable 2009 investment returns as compared with the expected long-term return assumption . our pension plan contribution requirements are not particularly sensitive to actuarial assumptions . investment performance has the most impact on contribution requirements and will drive the amount of permitted contributions in future years . also , current law , including the provisions of the pension protection act of 2006 , sets limits as to both minimum and maximum contributions to the plan . we expect that the minimum required contributions under the law will be zero for 2010 . we maintain other defined benefit plans that have a less significant effect on financial results , including various .\n", "context_type":

well as the current state of technology and prior experience in remediating contaminated sites . these estimates are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect changes in facts and technical and legal circumstances . management estimates that as of december 31 , 2011 , the probable future costs for environmental remediation is $ 3 million , which is accrued in other current liabilities . factors that could result in changes to the company 2019s estimates include : modification of planned remedial actions , increases or decreases in the estimated time required to remediate , changes to the determination of legally responsible parties , discovery of more extensive contamination than anticipated , changes in laws and regulations affecting remediation requirements , and improvements in remediation technology . should other prps not pay their allocable share of remediation costs , the company may have to incur costs exceeding those already estimated and accrued . in addition , there

jpmorgan chase & co . / 2007 annual report expected loss modeling in 2006 , the firm restructured four multi-seller conduits that it administers . the restructurings included enhancing the firm 2019s expected loss model . in determining the primary beneficiary of the conduits it administers , the firm uses a monte carlo 2013based model to estimate the expected losses of each of the conduits and considers the rela- tive rights and obligations of each of the variable interest holders . the variability to be considered in the modeling of expected losses is based on the design of the entity . the firm 2019s traditional multi-seller conduits are designed to pass credit risk , not liquidity risk , to its vari- able interest holders , as the assets are intended to be held in the conduit for the longer term . under fin 46r , the firm is required to run the monte carlo-based expected loss model each time a reconsideration event occurs . in applying this guidance to the conduits , the following events are considered to be reconsideration events as they could affect the determination of the primary beneficiary of the conduits : 2022 new deals , including the issuance of new or additional variable interests ( credit support , liquidity facilities , etc ) ; 2022 changes in usage , including the change in the level of outstand- ing variable interests ( credit support , liquidity facilities , etc ) ; 2022 modifications of asset purchase agreements ; and 2022 sales of interests held by the primary beneficiary . from an operational perspective , the firm does not run its monte carlo-based expected loss model every time there is a reconsidera- tion event due to the frequency of their occurrence . instead , the firm runs its expected loss model each quarter and includes a growth assumption for each conduit to ensure that a sufficient amount of elns exists for each conduit at any point during the quarter . as part of its normal quarterly model review , the firm reassesses the underlying assumptions and inputs of the expected loss model . during the second half of 2007 , certain assumptions used in the model were adjusted to reflect the then current market conditions . specifically , risk ratings and loss given default assumptions relating to residential subprime mortgage exposures were modified . for other nonmortgage-related asset classes , the firm determined that the assumptions in the model required little adjustment . as a result of the updates to the model , during the fourth quarter of 2007 the terms of the elns were renegotiated to increase the level of commit- ment and funded amounts to be provided by the eln holders . the total amount of expected loss notes outstanding at december 31 , 2007 and 2006 , were $ 130 million and $ 54 million , respectively . management concluded that the model assumptions used were reflective of market participant 2019s assumptions and appropriately considered the probability of a recurrence of recent market events . qualitative considerations the multi-seller conduits are primarily designed to provide an efficient means for clients to access the commercial paper market . the firm believes the conduits effectively disperse risk among all parties and that the preponderance of economic risk in the firm 2019s multi-seller conduits is not held by jpmorgan chase . the percentage of assets in the multi-seller conduits that the firm views as client-related represent 99% ( 99 % ) and 98% ( 98 % ) of the total conduits 2019 holdings at december 31 , 2007 and 2006 , respectively . consolidated sensitivity analysis on capital it is possible that the firm could be required to consolidate a vie if it were determined that the firm became the primary beneficiary of the vie under the provisions of fin 46r . the factors involved in making the determination of whether or not a vie should be consolidated are dis- cussed above and in note 1 on page 108 of this annual report . the table below

should it become necessary . investor intermediation as a financial intermediary , the firm creates certain types of vies and also structures transactions , typically derivative structures , with these vies to meet investor needs . the firm may also provide liquidity and other support . the risks inherent in the derivative instruments or liq- uidity commitments are managed similarly to other credit , market or liquidity risks to which the firm is exposed . the principal types of vies for which the firm is engaged in these structuring activities are municipal bond vehicles , credit-linked note vehicles and collateralized debt obligation vehicles . municipal bond vehicles the firm has created a series of secondary market trusts that provide short-term investors with qualifying tax-exempt investments , and that allow investors in tax-exempt securities to finance their investments at short-term tax-exempt rates . in a typical transaction , the vehicle pur- chases fixed-rate longer-term highly rated municipal bonds and funds the purchase by issuing two types of securities : ( 1 ) putable floating- rate certificates and ( 2 ) inverse floating-rate residual interests ( 201cresid- ual interests 201d ) . the maturity of each of the putable floating-rate certifi- cates and the residual interests is equal to the life of the vehicle , while the maturity of the underlying municipal bonds is longer . holders of the putable floating-rate certificates may 201cput 201d , or tender , the certifi- cates if the remarketing agent cannot successfully remarket the float- ing-rate certificates to another investor . a liquidity facility conditionally obligates the liquidity provider to fund the purchase of the tendered floating-rate certificates . upon termination of the vehicle , if the pro- ceeds from the sale of the underlying municipal bonds are not suffi- cient to repay the liquidity facility , the liquidity provider has recourse either to excess collateralization in the vehicle or the residual interest holders for reimbursement . the third-party holders of the residual interests in these vehicles could experience losses if the face amount of the putable floating-rate cer- tificates exceeds the market value of the municipal bonds upon termi- nation of the vehicle . certain vehicles require a smaller initial invest- ment by the residual interest holders and thus do not result in excess collateralization . for these vehicles there exists a reimbursement obli- .\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program":

operating costs . our average paper and packaging prices in 2006 increased faster than our costs for the first time in four years . the improve- ment in sales volumes reflects increased uncoated papers , corrugated box , coated paperboard and european papers shipments , as well as improved revenues from our xpedx distribution business . our manufacturing operations also made solid cost reduction improvements . lower interest expense , reflecting debt repayments in 2005 and 2006 , was also a positive factor . together , these improvements more than offset the effects of continued high raw material and distribution costs , lower real estate sales , higher net corporate expenses and lower con- tributions from businesses and forestlands divested during 2006 . looking forward to 2007 , we expect seasonally higher sales volumes in the first quarter . average paper price realizations should continue to improve as we implement previously announced price increases in europe and brazil . input costs for energy , fiber and chemicals are expected to be mixed , although slightly higher in the first quarter . operating results will benefit from the recently completed international paper/sun paperboard joint ventures in china and the addition of the luiz anto- nio paper mill to our operations in brazil . however , primarily as a result of lower real estate sales in the first quarter , we anticipate earnings from continuing operations will be somewhat lower than in the 2006 fourth quarter . significant steps were also taken in 2006 in the execution of the company 2019s transformation plan . we completed the sales of our u.s . and brazilian coated papers businesses and 5.6 million acres of u.s . forestlands , and announced definitive sale agreements for our kraft papers , beverage pack- aging and arizona chemical businesses and a majority of our wood products business , all expected to close during 2007 . through december 31 , 2006 , we have received approximately $ 9.7 billion of the estimated proceeds from divest- itures announced under this plan of approximately $ 11.3 billion , with the balance to be received as the remaining divestitures are completed in the first half of 2007 . we have strengthened our balance sheet by reducing debt by $ 6.2 billion , and returned value to our shareholders by repurchasing 39.7 million shares of our common stock for approximately $ 1.4 billion . we made a $ 1.0 billion voluntary contribution to our u.s . qualified pension fund . we have identified selective reinvestment opportunities totaling approx- imately $ 2.0 billion , including opportunities in china , brazil and russia . finally , we remain focused on our three-year $ 1.2 billion target for non-price profit- ability improvements , with $ 330 million realized during 2006 . while more remains to be done in 2007 , we have made substantial progress toward achiev- ing the objectives announced at the outset of the plan in july 2005 .
