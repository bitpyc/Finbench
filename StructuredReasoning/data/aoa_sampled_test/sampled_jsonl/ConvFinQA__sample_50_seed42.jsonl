brazil distribution 2014 due to a portfolio evaluation in the first half of 2016 , management has decided to pursue a strategic shift of its distribution companies in brazil , aes sul and eletropaulo . the disposal of sul was completed in october 2016 . in december 2016 , eletropaulo underwent a corporate restructuring which is expected to , among other things , provide more liquidity of its shares . aes is continuing to pursue strategic options for eletropaulo in order to complete its strategic shift to reduce aes 2019 exposure to the brazilian distribution business , including preparation for listing its shares into the novo mercado , which is a listing segment of the brazilian stock exchange with the highest standards of corporate governance . the company executed an agreement for the sale of its wholly-owned subsidiary aes sul in june 2016 . we have reported the results of operations and financial position of aes sul as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented . upon meeting the held-for-sale criteria , the company recognized an after tax loss of $ 382 million comprised of a pretax impairment charge of $ 783 million , offset by a tax benefit of $ 266 million related to the impairment of the sul long lived assets and a tax benefit of $ 135 million for deferred taxes related to the investment in aes sul . prior to the impairment charge in the second quarter , the carrying value of the aes sul asset group of $ 1.6 billion was greater than its approximate fair value less costs to sell . however , the impairment charge was limited to the carrying value of the long lived assets of the aes sul disposal group . on october 31 , 2016 , the company completed the sale of aes sul and received final proceeds less costs to sell of $ 484 million , excluding contingent consideration . upon disposal of aes sul , we incurred an additional after- tax loss on sale of $ 737 million . the cumulative impact to earnings of the impairment and loss on sale was $ 1.1 billion . this includes the reclassification of approximately $ 1 billion of cumulative translation losses , resulting in a net reduction to the company 2019s stockholders 2019 equity of $ 92 million . sul 2019s pretax loss attributable to aes for the years ended december 31 , 2016 and 2015 was $ 1.4 billion and $ 32 million , respectively . sul 2019s pretax gain attributable to aes for the year ended december 31 , 2014 was $ 133 million . prior to its classification as discontinued operations , sul was reported in the brazil sbu reportable segment . as discussed in note 1 2014general and summary of significant accounting policies , effective july 1 , 2014 , the company prospectively adopted asu no . 2014-08 .

and approximately $ 55 million for strategic missile and defense systems due to lower volume . these decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of approximately $ 235 million for businesses acquired in 2014 ;

than in the fourth quarter of 2006 . containerboard export sales volumes are expected to decline due to scheduled first-quarter main- tenance outages . sales volumes for u.s . converted products will be higher due to more shipping days , but expected softer demand should cause the ship- ments per day to decrease . average sales price real- izations are expected to be comparable to fourth- quarter averages . an additional containerboard price increase was announced in january that is expected to be fully realized in the second quarter . costs for wood , energy , starch , adhesives and freight are expected to increase . manufacturing costs will be higher due to costs associated with scheduled main- tenance outages in the containerboard mills . euro- pean container operating results are expected to improve as seasonally higher sales volumes and improved margins more than offset slightly higher manufacturing costs . consumer packaging demand and pricing for consumer packaging prod- ucts correlate closely with consumer spending and general economic activity . in addition to prices and volumes , major factors affecting the profitability of consumer packaging are raw material and energy costs , manufacturing efficiency and product mix . consumer packaging net sales increased 9% ( 9 % ) compared with 2005 and 7% ( 7 % ) compared with 2004 . operating profits rose 8% ( 8 % ) from 2005 , but declined 15% ( 15 % ) from 2004 levels . compared with 2005 , higher sales volumes ( $ 9 million ) , improved average sales price realizations ( $ 33 million ) , reduced lack-of-order downtime ( $ 18 million ) , and favorable mill oper- ations ( $ 25 million ) were partially offset by higher raw material costs ( $ 19 million ) and freight costs ( $ 21 million ) , unfavorable mix (

2004 . sales volumes increased in 2006 compared with 2005 , particularly in the folding car- ton board segment , reflecting improved demand for coated paperboard products . in 2006 , our coated paperboard mills took 4000 tons of lack-of-order downtime , compared with 82000 tons of lack-of-order downtime in 2005 . average sales price realizations were substantially improved in the cur- rent year , principally for folding carton board and cupstock board . operating profits were 51% ( 51 % ) higher in 2006 than in 2005 , and 7% ( 7 % ) better than in 2004 . the impact of the higher sales prices along with more favorable manufacturing operations due to strong performance at the mills more than offset higher input costs for energy and freight . foodservice net sales declined to $ 396 million in 2006 , compared with $ 437 million in 2005 and $ 480 million in 2004 , due principally to the sale of the jackson , tennessee plant in july 2005 . sales vol- umes were lower in 2006 than in 2005 , although average sales prices were higher due to the realiza- tion of price increases implemented during 2005 . operating profits for 2006 improved over 2005 and 2004 levels largely due to the benefits from higher sales prices . raw material costs for bleached board were higher than in 2005 , but manufacturing costs were more favorable due to increased productivity and reduced waste . shorewood net sales of $ 670 million were down from $ 691 million in 2005 and $ 687 million in 2004 . sales volumes in 2006 were down from 2005 levels due to weak demand in the home entertainment and consumer products markets , although demand was strong in the tobacco segment . average sales prices for the year were lower than in 2005 . operating prof- its were down significantly from both 2005 and 2004 due to the decline in sales , particularly in the higher margin home entertainment markets , higher raw material costs for bleached board and certain inventory adjustment costs . entering 2007 , coated paperboard first-quarter sales volumes are expected to be seasonally stronger than in the fourth quarter 2006 for folding carton board and bristols . average sales price realizations are expected to rise with a price increase announced in january . it is anticipated that manufacturing costs will improve versus an unfavorable fourth quarter . foodservice earnings for the first quarter of 2007 are expected to decline due to seasonally weaker vol- ume . however , sales price realizations will be slightly higher , and the seasonal switch to hot cup contain- ers will have a favorable impact on product mix . shorewood sales volumes for the first quarter of 2007 are expected to seasonally decline , but the earnings impact will be partially offset by pricing improvements and an

contributions of $ 106 million . any subsequent adjustments to allocate earnings and dividends to our partner , or measure the investment at fair value , will be classified as temporary equity each reporting period as it is probable that the shares will become redeemable . ipl 2014 ipl had $ 60 million of cumulative preferred stock outstanding at december 31 , 2016 and 2015 , which represented five series of preferred stock . the total annual dividend requirements were approximately $ 3 million at december 31 , 2016 and 2015 . certain series of the preferred stock were redeemable solely at the option of the issuer at prices between $ 100 and $ 118 per share . holders of the preferred stock are entitled to elect a majority of ipl's board of directors if ipl has not paid dividends to its preferred stockholders for four consecutive quarters . based on the preferred stockholders' ability to elect a majority of ipl's board of directors in this circumstance , the redemption of the preferred shares is considered to be not solely within the control of the issuer and the preferred stock is considered temporary equity . dpl 2014 dpl had $ 18 million of cumulative preferred stock outstanding as of december 31 , 2015 , which represented three series of preferred stock issued by dp&l , a wholly-owned subsidiary of dpl . the dp&l preferred stock was redeemable at dp&l's option as

contained provisions that permitted preferred stockholders to elect members of the dp&l board of directors in the event that cumulative dividends on the preferred stock are in arrears in an aggregate amount equivalent to at least four full quarterly dividends . based on the preferred stockholders' ability to elect members of dp&l's board of directors in this circumstance , the redemption of the preferred shares was considered to be not solely within the control of the issuer and the preferred stock was considered temporary equity . in september 2016 , it became probable that the preferred shares would become redeemable . as such , the company recorded an adjustment of $ 5 million to retained earnings to adjust the preferred shares to their redemption value of $ 23 million . in october 2016 , dp&l redeemed all of its preferred shares . upon redemption , the preferred shares were no longer outstanding and all rights of the holders thereof as shareholders of dp&l ceased to exist .

additional $ 349 million in ipalco through 2016 in exchange for a 17.65% ( 17.65 % ) equity stake . in april 2015 , cdpq invested an additional $ 214 million in ipalco , which resulted in cdpq's combined direct and indirect interest in ipalco of 24.90% ( 24.90 % ) . as a result of these transactions , $ 84 million in taxes and transaction costs were recognized as a net decrease to equity . the company also recognized an increase to additional paid-in capital and a reduction to retained earnings of 377 million for the excess of the fair value of the shares over their book value . no gain or loss was recognized in net income as the transaction was not considered to be a sale of in-substance real estate . in march 2016 , cdpq exercised its remaining option by investing $ 134 million in ipalco , which resulted in cdpq's combined direct and indirect interest in ipalco of 30% ( 30 % ) . the company also recognized an increase to additional paid-in capital and a reduction to retained earnings of $ 84 million for the excess of the fair value of the shares over their book value . in june 2016 , cdpq contributed an additional $ 24 million to ipalco , with no impact to the ownership
