The Share Repurchase Program has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. There is no minimum number of shares of common stock that the Company is required to repurchase under the Share Repurchase Program. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has acquired 223,823 shares of common stock at an aggregate value of $9 million and an average of $40.80 per share. No shares were repurchased during the years ended December 31, 2021 or 2020.Note 16. Employee Benefit Plans401(k) PlansThe Company offers several savings and retirement plans to substantially all employees who are not covered by collective bargaining agreements, who meet certain eligibility requirements, namely terms of service. All existing savings and retirement plans transitioned into the Caesars Entertainment, Inc. 401(k) Plan with Prudential Retirement. Under the 401(k) plan, the Company matches contributions equal to 50% of the first 6% as outlined per plan documents.The Company’s matching contribution expense totaled $27 million, $11 million and $6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.Defined-Benefit PlansScioto Downs sponsors a noncontributory defined-benefit plan covering all full-time employees meeting certain age and service requirements. On May 31, 2001, the plan was amended to freeze eligibility, accrual of years of service and benefits. As of December 31, 2021, the fair value of the plan assets was $1 million, and the fair value of the benefit obligations was $1 million. The plan assets are comprised primarily of money market and mutual funds whose values are determined based on quoted market prices and are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. We did not make cash contributions to the Scioto Downs pension plan during 2021, 2020 and 2019.In addition, the Company also sponsors a defined-benefit plan for certain Tropicana Atlantic City employees under a Variable Annuity Pension Plan. As of December 31, 2021, the fair value of both, the plan assets and benefit obligations, was $21 million. Contributions to the plan were less than $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.The Company participated in a defined-benefit plan for employees of the London Clubs International subsidiary that provided benefits based on final pensionable salary. As of December 31, 2020, the plan had a net pension liability of $20 million, which was recorded within liabilities held for sale on our Balance Sheets. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we contributed $4 million to the plan. On July 16, 2021, the Company completed the sale of Caesars UK Group, in which the buyer assumed all liabilities associated with the Caesars UK Group.Deferred Compensation PlansCEI assumed Former Caesars deferred compensation plans, the Caesars Entertainment Corporation Executive Supplemental Savings Plan III (“ESSP III”) and the Caesars Entertainment Corporation Outside Director Deferred Compensation Plan. These plans are unfunded, non-qualified deferred compensation plans. Payment obligations pursuant to the plans are unsecured general obligations of the Company and affiliates of the Company employing participants in the ESSP III. The liability as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $3 million and $2 million, respectively, which was recorded in Deferred credits and other liabilities. As of December 31, 2021, certain current and former employees of Caesars, and our subsidiaries and affiliates, have balances under: (i) the Harrah’s Entertainment, Inc. Executive Supplemental Savings Plan, (ii) the Harrah’s Entertainment, Inc. Executive Supplemental Savings Plan II, (iii) the Park Place Entertainment Corporation Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, (iv) the Harrah’s Entertainment, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan, and (v) the Harrah’s Entertainment, Inc. Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (collectively, the “existing deferred compensation plans”). These plans are deferred compensation plans that allow certain employees an opportunity to save for retirement and other purposes.Each of the plans is now frozen and is no longer accepting contributions. However, participants may still earn returns on existing plan balances based upon their selected investment alternatives, which are reflected in their deferral accounts. The total liability recorded in Deferred credits and other liabilities for these plans was $43 million and $49 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.[Table of Contents](#i37dfc5eabc12461dbfc5ef573d80947e_7)107\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

The Tax Sharing Agreement provides that each party is allocated an amount of tax similar to that which would be owed had the party been separately subject to tax. In addition, any net federal and state benefits attributable to Exelon are reallocated to the other Registrants. That allocation is treated as a contribution from Exelon to the party receiving the benefit.

Retirement Benefits (All Registrants)Exelon sponsors defined benefit pension plans and OPEB plans for essentially all current employees. Substantially all non-union employees and electing union employees hired on or after January 1, 2001 participate in cash balance pension plans. Effective January 1, 2009, substantially all newly-hired union-represented employees participate in cash balance pension plans. Effective February 1, 2018 for most newly-hired Generation and BSC non-represented, non-craft, employees, January 1, 2021 for most newly-hired utility management employees, and for certain newly-hired union employees pursuant to their collective bargaining agreements, these newly-hired employees are not eligible for pension benefits, and will instead be eligible to receive an enhanced non-discretionary employer contribution in an Exelon defined contribution savings plan. Effective January 1, 2018, most newly-hired non-represented, non-craft, employees are not eligible for OPEB benefits and employees represented by Local 614 are not eligible for retiree health care benefits. Effective January 1, 2021, most non-represented, non-craft, employees who are under the age of 40 are not eligible for retiree health care benefits. Effective January 1, 2022, management employees retiring on or after that date are no longer eligible for retiree life insurance benefits.Effective January 1, 2019, Exelon merged the Exelon Corporation Cash Balance Pension Plan (CBPP) into the Exelon Corporation Retirement Program (ECRP). The merging of the plans did not change the benefits offered to the plan participants and, thus, had no impact on Exelon's pension obligation. However, beginning in 2019, actuarial losses and gains related to the CBPP and ECRP are amortized over participants’ average remaining service period of the merged ECRP rather than each individual plan.Effective February 1, 2022, in connection with the separation, pension and OPEB obligations and assets for current and former Generation employees and shared service employees supporting Generation, were transferred to pension and OPEB plans and trusts established by Generation.  \n264  \n  \n  \n\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

We provided the FCC with an upfront deposit of $123 in the third quarter of 2021 and paid the remaining $8,956 in the first quarter of 2022, for a total of $9,079. We funded the purchase price using cash and short-term investments. We received the licenses in May 2022 and classified the auction deposits and related capitalized interest as “Licenses - Net” on our September 30, 2022 consolidated balance sheet.  \nIn February 2021, the FCC announced that we were the winning bidder for 1,621 C-Band licenses. We provided the FCC an upfront deposit of $550 in 2020 and cash payments totaling $22,856 in the first quarter of 2021, for a total of $23,406. The licenses were received in July 2021. In the third quarter of 2022, we paid $98 of compensable relocation costs for a total of $1,703 Incentive Payments and compensable relocation costs paid to date for the C-Band licenses, with $1,605 paid in 2021.   \nCash paid, including spectrum deposits (net of refunds), capitalized interest, and any payments for incentive and relocation costs are included in “Acquisitions, net of cash acquired” on our consolidated statements of cash flows.

Each AT&T shareholder was entitled to receive 0.241917 shares of WBD common stock for each share of AT&T common stock held as of the record date, which represented approximately 71% of WBD. In connection with and in accordance with the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement (SDA), prior to the distribution and merger, AT&T received approximately $40,400, which includes $38,800 of Spinco cash and $1,600 of debt retained by WarnerMedia. During the second quarter, assets of approximately $121,100 and liabilities of $70,600 were removed from our balance sheet as well as $45,041 of retained earnings and $5,632 of additional paid-in capital associated with the transaction. Additionally, in August 2022, we and WBD finalized the post-closing adjustment, pursuant to section 1.3 of the SDA, which resulted in a $1,200 payment to WBD in the third quarter of 2022.

On January 12, 2022, in accordance with the January 2022 ASR Agreements, we made a payment of $1 billion ($500 million to Mizuho and $500 million to Wells Fargo) and received an initial delivery of 2.2 million shares of our common stock (1.08 million shares each from Mizuho and Wells Fargo). In January 2022, we recorded the payments to Mizuho and Wells Fargo as a reduction to stockholders’ equity, consisting of an $850 million increase in treasury stock, which reflects the value of the initial 2.2 million shares received upon initial settlement, and a $150 million decrease in capital in excess of par value, which reflects the value of stock held back by Mizuho and Wells Fargo pending final settlement of the January 2022 ASR Agreements.

Our remaining repurchase authorization was $2 billion as of November 1, 2022.In connection with employee stock plans, we acquired 0.07 million common shares for $32 million and 0.09 million common shares for $36 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  \nFor additional information regarding our stockholders' equity, refer to Note 16 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" in our 2021 Form 10-K.  \n11. INCOME TAXESThe effective income tax rate was 8.2% and 22.5% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, and 7.2% and 15.4% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively. The year-over-year increase in the effective income tax rates is primarily due to the impact of the August 2021 acquisition of the remaining 60% interest in KAH. In that period, we recognized a $1.1 billion mark-to-market gain related to our previously held 40% investment in KAH. This unrealized gain was not taxable, thereby reducing the effective income tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. The increase is partially offset by the August 2022 disposition of our 60% interest in KAH Hospice, which resulted in an increase to our tax basis in both the shares sold and the shares retained, thereby reducing the effective income tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022.  \nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law. The Inflation Reduction Act includes various tax provisions, which are effective for the tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2023. We do not expect these tax changes to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.   \nFor additional information regarding income taxes, refer to Note 2 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" in our 2021 Form 10-K.  \n  \n23\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

In the third quarter of 2021, Exelon reversed $81 million of severance benefit costs and $13 million of other one-time charges initially recorded in Operating and maintenance expense in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 associated with the early retirements. In addition, the expected economic useful life for both facilities was updated to 2044 and 2046 for Byron Units 1 and 2, respectively, and to 2029 and 2031 for Dresden Units 2 and 3, respectively, the end of the respective NRC operating license for each unit. Depreciation was therefore adjusted beginning September 15, 2021, to reflect these extended useful life estimates. See Note 10 — Asset Retirement Obligations for additional detail on changes to the nuclear decommissioning ARO balances resulting from the initial decision and subsequent reversal of the decision to early retire Byron and Dresden.In Pennsylvania, the TMI nuclear plant did not clear in the May 2017 PJM capacity auction for the 2020-2021 planning year, the third consecutive year that TMI failed to clear the PJM base residual capacity auction and on May 30, 2017, based on these capacity auction results, prolonged periods of low wholesale power prices, and the absence of federal or state policies, Generation announced that it would permanently cease generation operations at TMI. On September 20, 2019, TMI permanently ceased generation operations.

Decommissioning-related impacts were not offset for the Byron units starting in the second quarter of 2021 due to the inability to recognize a regulatory asset at ComEd. With the September 15, 2021 reversal of the previous decision to retire Byron, Generation resumed contractual offset for Byron as of that date. Based on the regulatory agreement with the ICC, decommissioning-related activities are offset in Exelon's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income as long as the net cumulative decommissioning-related activities result in a regulatory liability at ComEd. The offset resulted in an equal adjustment to the regulatory liabilities at ComEd. See Note 10 — Asset Retirement Obligations for additional information.  \nOther GenerationIn March 2018, Generation notified ISO-NE of its plans to early retire, among other assets, the Mystic Generating Station's units 8 and 9 (Mystic 8 and 9) absent regulatory reforms to properly value reliability and regional fuel security. Thereafter, ISO-NE identified Mystic 8 and 9 as being needed to ensure fuel security for the region and entered into a cost of service agreement with these two units for the period between June 1, 2022 - May 31, 2024. The agreement was approved by the FERC in December 2018.On June 10, 2020, Generation filed a complaint with FERC against ISO-NE stating that ISO-NE failed to follow its tariff with respect to its evaluation of Mystic 8 and 9 for transmission security for the 2024 to 2025 Capacity Commitment Period and that the modifications that ISO-NE made to its unfiled planning procedures to avoid 241  \n  \n  \n\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

(“Syros”). Under this agreement, Syros will use its proprietary gene control platform to identify novel therapeutic targets with a focus in myeloproliferative neoplasms and we have received options to obtain exclusive worldwide rights to intellectual property resulting from the collaboration for up to seven validated targets. We will have exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize any therapies under the collaboration that modulate those validated targets. We have agreed to pay Syros up to $54.0 million in target selection and option exercise fees should we decide to exercise all of our options under the agreement. For products resulting from the collaboration against each of the seven selected and validated targets, we have agreed to pay up to $50.0 million in potential development and regulatory milestones and up to $65.0 million in potential sales milestones. Syros is also eligible to receive low single-digit royalties on net sales of products resulting from the collaboration.In addition, in 2018, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Syros, pursuant to which we purchased 0.8 million shares of Syros common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million in cash, or $12.61 per share. Subsequently in 2018, we entered into an Amended Stock Purchase Agreement with Syros, pursuant to which we purchased an additional 0.1 million shares of Syros common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $1.4 million in cash, or $9.55 per share. In September 2022, Syros effected a one-for-ten stock split of its outstanding common stock, adjusting our ownership to 93,753 shares of Syros’s common stock. The fair market value of our long term investment in Syros as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was $0.6 million and $3.1 million, respectively.We intend to hold the investment in Syros for the foreseeable future and therefore, are accounting for our shares held in Syros at fair value whereby the investment is marked to market through earnings in each reporting period. Given our intent to hold the investment for the foreseeable future, we have classified the investment within long term investments on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, we recorded an unrealized loss of $0.3 million and $2.5 million, respectively, based on the change in fair value of Syros’ common stock during the respective periods. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, we recorded an unrealized loss of $0.9 million and $6.0 million, respectively, based on the change in fair value of Syros’ common stock during the respective periods.Innovent In December 2018, we entered into a Research Collaboration and Licensing Agreement with Innovent. Under the terms of this agreement, Innovent received exclusive development and commercialization rights to our clinical-stage product candidates pemigatinib, itacitinib and parsaclisib in hematology and oncology in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. We are eligible to receive up to an additional $94.0 million in potential development and regulatory milestones.We recognize development and regulatory milestones upon confirmation of achievement of the event, as development and regulatory approvals are events not controllable by us but rather development activities of Innovent and decisions made by regulatory agencies. In March 2022, we recognized a $5.0 million milestone for approval of PEMAZYRE (pemigatinib) in China.In the event of commercialization of the licensed molecule, we are eligible to receive up to $202.5 million in potential sales milestones from Innovent. We will recognize sales milestones in the corresponding period of the product sale upon confirmation of net sales milestone threshold achievement by Innovent. We are also eligible to receive tiered royalties from the high-teens to the low-twenties on future sales of products resulting from the collaboration.

The measurement involves various factors, assumptions, and accounting elections. The impact of assumption changes or experience different from that assumed on pension and OPEB obligations is recognized over time rather than immediately recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Gains or losses in excess of the greater of ten percent of the projected benefit obligation or the MRV of plan assets are amortized over the expected average remaining service period of plan participants.

CENG is 100% consolidated in Exelon's financial statements. See Note 23 — Variable Interest Entities for additional information. On April 1, 2014, Generation and EDF entered into various agreements including a NOSA, an amended LLC Operating Agreement, an Employee Matters Agreement, and a Put Option Agreement, among others. Under the amended LLC Operating Agreement, CENG made a $400 million special distribution to EDF and committed to make preferred distributions to Generation until Generation has received aggregate distributions of $400 million plus a return of 8.50% per annum. Under the terms of the Put Option Agreement, EDF had the option to sell its 49.99% equity interest in CENG to Generation exercisable beginning on January 1, 2016 and thereafter until June 30, 2022. On November 20, 2019, Generation received notice of EDF’s intention to exercise the put option to sell its interest in CENG to Generation, and the put automatically exercised on January 19, 2020 at the end of the sixty-day advance notice period. The transaction required approval by FERC and the NYPSC, which approvals were received on July 30, 2020 and April 15, 2021, respectively. On August 6, 2021, Generation and EDF entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which Generation purchased EDF’s equity interest in CENG for a net purchase price of $885 million, which includes, among other things, an adjustment for EDF’s share of the balance of the preferred distribution payable by CENG to Generation. The difference between the net purchase price and EDF’s noncontrolling interest as of August 6, 2021 was recorded in Common stock in Exelon’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The Other charges include costs incurred related to the initial suspension (the Suspension) and Wind down of our businesses and operations in Russia. These costs impacted all reportable business segments, with the most significant impact within the Performance Materials and Technologies reportable business segment. The Other charges include costs recorded in Cost of products sold, Selling, general and administrative expenses, or Other (income) expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, Cost of products and services sold includes $60 million primarily related to inventory reserves and the write-down of other assets, Selling, general and administrative includes $183 million primarily related to reserves against outstanding accounts receivable and contract assets, impairment of intangible assets, the write-down of other assets, and employee severance, and Other (income) expense includes $48 million related to foreign exchange revaluation on an intercompany loan with a Russian affiliate, impairment of property, plant and equipment, and expenses for called guarantees. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Other charges does not include a $2 million tax valuation allowance recorded to Tax expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations, directly attributable to our Wind down of businesses and operations in Russia. Given the uncertainty inherent in the Company's remaining obligations related to our contracts with Russian counterparties, the Company does not believe it is possible to develop estimates of reasonably possible loss in excess of current accruals for these matters (other than as specifically set forth above). Based on available information to date, the Company’s estimate of potential future losses or other contingencies related to Suspension and Wind down activities, including any guarantee payments or any litigation costs or as otherwise related to the Company's Wind down in Russia, could adversely affect the Company's consolidated results of operations in the periods recognized but would not be material with respect to the Company's consolidated financial position.

INCOME TAXES The effective tax rate was higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% and increased during 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to charges and accrual of reserves directly attributable to the initial Suspension and Wind down of our businesses and operations in Russia without corresponding tax benefit, an expense related to UOP matters without corresponding tax benefit, lower tax benefits for employee share-based compensation, and incremental tax reserves and state taxes, partially offset by the favorable resolution of certain foreign tax matters.NOTE 7.

Additions to capitalized exploratory well costs pending the determination of proved reserves are related to wells drilled on the Stabroek Block (Hess 30%), offshore Guyana, the Huron-1 well (Hess 40%) in the Gulf of Mexico, and the Zanderij-1 well on Block 42 (Hess 33%), offshore Suriname. Reclassifications to wells, facilities and equipment based on the determination of proved reserves resulted from the sanction of the Yellowtail Field development project, the fourth sanctioned project on the Stabroek Block. At September 30, 2022, exploratory well costs capitalized for greater than one year following completion of drilling of $497 million was comprised of the following:Guyana: Approximately 90% of the capitalized well costs in excess of one year relate to successful exploration wells where hydrocarbons were encountered on the Stabroek Block.  The operator plans further appraisal drilling on the Block and is conducting pre-development planning for additional phases of development.Joint Development Area (JDA):  Approximately 8% of the capitalized well costs in excess of one year relates to the JDA (Hess 50%) in the Gulf of Thailand, where hydrocarbons were encountered in three successful exploration wells drilled in the western part of Block A-18. The operator has submitted a development plan concept to the regulator to facilitate ongoing commercial negotiations for an extension of the existing gas sales contract to include development of the western part of the Block.Malaysia:  Approximately 2% of the capitalized well costs in excess of one year relate to the North Malay Basin (Hess 50%), offshore Peninsular Malaysia, where hydrocarbons were encountered in one successful exploration well.

SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY AND NET INCOME PER SHARE2020 Public Equity OfferingIn June 2020, the Company completed the underwritten public offering of approximately 15.1 million ordinary shares at a price of $75.91 per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $1,115 million, after deducting expenses and the underwriters’ discount of $35 million. Simultaneously, the Company completed the underwritten public offering of 11.5 million 5.50% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Shares, Series A, $0.01 par value per share (the “MCPS”) with a liquidation preference of $100 per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $1,115 million, after deducting expenses and the underwriters’ discount of $35 million.Each share of MCPS will mandatorily convert on the mandatory conversion date of June 15, 2023, into between 1.0754 and 1.3173 shares of the Company’s ordinary shares, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, and further adjustment if there are any accumulated and unpaid MCPS dividends at the conversion date. The number of the Company’s ordinary shares issuable upon conversion will be determined based on the volume-weighted average price per share of the Company’s ordinary shares over the 20 consecutive trading day period beginning on, and including the 21st scheduled trading day immediately before June 15, 2023. Subject to certain exceptions, at any time prior to June 15, 2023, holders of the MCPS may elect to convert each share into 1.0754 ordinary shares, subject to further anti-dilution adjustments. In the event of a fundamental change, the MCPS will convert at the fundamental change rates specified in the statement of rights, and the holders of the MCPS would be entitled to a fundamental change make-whole dividend.Holders of the MCPS will be entitled to receive, when and if declared by the Company’s Board of Directors, cumulative dividends at the annual rate of 5.50% of the liquidation preference of $100 per share (equivalent to $5.50 annually per share), payable in cash or, subject to certain limitations, by delivery of the Company’s ordinary shares or any combination of cash and the Company’s ordinary shares, at the Company’s election. If declared, dividends on the MCPS will be payable quarterly on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year (commencing on September 15, 2020 to, and including June 15, 2023), to the holders of record of the MCPS as they appear on the Company’s share register at the close of business on the immediately preceding March 1, June 1, September 1 or December 1, respectively.Net Income Per ShareBasic net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share reflects the weighted average dilutive impact of all potentially dilutive securities from the date of issuance and is computed using the treasury stock and if-converted methods. The if-converted method is used to determine if the impact of the conversion of the MCPS into ordinary shares is more dilutive than the MCPS dividends to net income per share. If so, the MCPS are assumed to have been converted at the later of the beginning of the period or the time of issuance, and the resulting ordinary shares are included in the denominator and the MCPS dividends are added back to the numerator. Unless otherwise noted, share and per share amounts included in these notes are on a diluted basis. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the impact of the MCPS calculated under the if-converted method was anti-dilutive, and as such, 12.37 million ordinary shares underlying the MCPS were excluded from the diluted income per share calculation. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the calculation of net income per share includes the dilutive impacts of the MCPS under the if-converted method. For all periods presented, the calculation of net income per share also contemplates the dilutive impacts, if any, of the Company’s share-based compensation plans. Refer to Note 21. Share-Based Compensation for additional information.99\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

There was no impairment of any capitalized contract acquisition costs during any period presented.Contract BalancesTiming may differ between the satisfaction of performance obligations and the invoicing and collection of amounts related to the Company's contracts with customers. Liabilities are recorded for amounts that the Company has the unconditional right to transfer goods and services under contracts with customers. These liabilities are classified as current and non-current deferred revenue.The table below shows significant movements in the deferred revenue balances (current and noncurrent) for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  | Three months endedDecember 31, |\n|  |  | 2021 |  | 2020 |\n| Balance, beginning of period |  | $ | 1,489,842  |  |  | $ | 1,272,632  |  |\n| Amounts added but not recognized as revenues |  | 441,591  |  |  | 421,918  |  |\n| Deferred revenue acquired through acquisition of businesses |  | 10,591  |  |  | —  |  |\n| Revenues recognized related to the opening balance of deferred revenue |  | (365,525) |  |  | (335,725) |  |\n| Balance, end of period |  | $ | 1,576,499  |  |  | $ | 1,358,825  |  |\n\nRemaining Performance ObligationsRemaining performance obligations represent the amount of the transaction price under contracts with customers that are attributable to performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially satisfied at the reporting date. As of December 31, 2021, the total non-cancelable remaining performance obligations under the Company's contracts with customers was approximately $1.6 billion and the Company expects to recognize revenues on approximately 65.9% of these remaining performance obligations over the next 12 months, 21.1% in year two, and the remaining balance thereafter.See Note 13, Segment Information, for disaggregated revenue by significant customer and geographic region, as well as disaggregated product revenue by systems and software.3. Fair Value MeasurementsIn accordance with the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements and disclosure under GAAP, the Company determines fair value using a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity, and the reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances and expands disclosure about fair value measurements.Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, essentially the exit price.10\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

Substantially all of the performance obligations associated with our Components are satisfied at a point in time, which typically occurs at shipment of our products. Terms of direct and distributor orders are generally Freight on Board (“FOB”) shipping point for U.S. orders or Free Carrier (“FCA”) shipping point for international orders. For certain sales transactions, control transfers at delivery of the product to the customer.In cases where our free-of-charge software, mobile applications and updates are deemed to be separate performance obligations, revenue is recognized over time on a ratable basis over the estimated life of the related Reusable Hardware component.Our sales of Components include an assurance-type warranty.Contract BalancesContract balances represent amounts presented in our consolidated balance sheets when either we have transferred goods or services to the customer or the customer has paid consideration to us under the contract. These contract balances include accounts receivable and deferred revenue. Payment terms vary by contract type and type of customer and generally range from 30 to 90 days.Accounts receivable as of September 30, 2022 included unbilled accounts receivable of $8.7 million. We expect to invoice and collect all unbilled accounts receivable within twelve months.We record deferred revenue when we have entered into a contract with a customer and cash payments are received or due prior to transfer of control or satisfaction of the related performance obligation.Our performance obligations are generally satisfied within twelve months of the initial contract date. The deferred revenue balances related to performance obligations that will be satisfied after twelve months was $23.6 million as of September 30, 2022 and $16.1 million as of December 31, 2021. These balances are included in other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Revenue recognized in the period from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods was not material for the periods presented.Deferred Cost of SalesDeferred cost of sales are associated with transactions for which revenue recognition criteria are not met but product has shipped and released from inventory. Deferred cost of sales are included in prepaid and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets.Incentive Compensation CostsWe generally expense incentive compensation associated with our internal sales force when incurred because the amortization period for such costs, if capitalized, would have been one year or less. We record these costs in selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Senior Convertible Notes |\n\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, which simplifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments, amends the guidance on derivative scope exceptions for contracts in an entity’s own equity, and modifies the guidance on diluted earnings per share calculations.We previously followed in Accounting Standard Codification, or ASC, 470-20, which required us to separate each of our convertible debt instruments at issuance into two units of accounting, a liability component, based on our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at issuance, and an equity component. Under ASU 2020-06, we now account for each of our convertible debt instruments as a single unit of accounting, a liability, because we concluded that there were no material conversion features that require bifurcation as a derivative under ASC 815-15 and our convertible debt instruments were not issued at a substantial premium. Since we adopted ASU 2020-06 using the full retrospective approach, we were required to apply the guidance to all convertible debt instruments we had outstanding as of January 1, 2020.Upon adoption of ASU 2020-06 as of January 1, 2020, we recognized $67.8 million cumulative-effect adjustment to increase retained earnings for the decrease in interest expense and $242.3 million decrease in additional paid in capital for the elimination of the equity component. We have updated these financial statements to reflect the cumulative adjustment for the periods presented. We have labeled our prior period financial statements and related notes “As Adjusted” to indicate the change required under the new accounting guidance.13\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

These standby letters of credit are renewed annually and were undrawn as of December 31, 2021.NOTE 5: INCOME TAXESC.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc., and its 80 percent (or more) owned U.S. subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. We file unitary or separate state returns based on state filing requirements. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to audits of U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax returns before 2014. We are currently under an Internal Revenue Service audit for the 2015-2017 tax years.In 2019, we removed our assertion that the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries were permanently reinvested with limited exceptions. If we repatriated all foreign earnings that are still considered to be permanently reinvested, the estimated effect on income taxes payable would be an increase of approximately $2.0 million as of December 31, 2021. On March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act allows for a deferral of the employer share of federal payroll taxes otherwise due through December 31, 2020. Under the act, 50 percent of the deferred amount was due December 31, 2021, and the remaining 50 percent is due December 31, 2022. This provision allows us to defer certain federal payroll deposits and invest this cash back into the business without any interest cost. The CARES Act also provides for a tax credit of up to $5,000 related to wages and health benefits provided to an employee whose work from March 17, 2020, through December 31, 2020, was impacted by COVID-19. Through December 31, 2021, we have recognized a payroll deferral and tax credit of $14.7 million and $0.7 million, respectively, under the CARES Act. On December 28, 2021, the Treasury Department released final regulations on determining the foreign tax credit, and allocating and apportioning deductions, under the Internal Revenue Code. The impact of this finalized guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our results.

We do not expect any material impact related to open tax years; however, actual settlements may differ from amounts accrued.As of December 31, 2021, we had $42.9 million of unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties, all of which would affect our effective tax rate if recognized. In the unlikely event these unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties were recognized fully in 2021, the impact to the annual effective tax rate would have been 4.2 percent. We are not aware of any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefit will significantly increase or decrease in the next 12 months. The total liability for unrecognized tax benefits is expected to decrease by approximately $5.9 million in the next 12 months due to lapsing of statutes. 52\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

Stock-based compensation expense is recognized ratably over the vesting term. The vesting of certain restricted stock grants is subject to attainment of specified performance criteria. Each fiscal quarter, Cadence estimates the probability of the achievement of these performance goals and recognizes any related stock-based compensation expense using the graded-vesting method. The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized in any one period can vary based on the attainment or expected attainment of the various performance goals. If such performance goals are not ultimately met, no compensation expense is recognized and any previously recognized compensation expense is reversed. Certain long-term, market-based performance stock awards granted to executives vest over three to five years and are subject to certain market conditions and the executive’s continuing service to Cadence. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized straight-line over the vesting term. If the market-based performance conditions are not ultimately met, compensation expense previously recognized is not reversed. As of January 1, 2022, Cadence had 1.3 million shares of unvested long-term, market-based performance stock awards outstanding.

{"question": "Zero or negative carrying amount of goodwill", "answer": "352", "task": "SEC-NUM", "context": "\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)Finite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names and customer relationships acquired in business combinations. Amortization is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. The Company evaluates for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. When indicators are noted, the Company then compares estimated future cash flows, undiscounted, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is recorded.In December 2021, the Company approved a capital plan which included the planned rebranding of certain of our properties, which is expected to be substantially complete by December 31, 2022. The Company utilized an income approach to determine the fair value of the trademarks subject to rebranding based on their expected future cash flows, which resulted in an impairment charge of $102 million. The adjusted carrying values of these trademarks, previously considered to have indefinite lives, have begun to be amortized over their respective remaining useful lives.During 2020, the Company recognized impairment charges in our Regional segment related to goodwill and trade names totaling $100 million and $16 million, respectively, due to declines in recent performance and the expected impact on future cash flows as a result of COVID-19. When assets are deemed to be held for sale, any associated intangible assets, including goodwill, are reclassified to Assets held for sale on our Balance Sheets (see Note 4).\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Changes in Carrying Value of Goodwill by Segment |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| (In millions) | Las Vegas |  | Regional |  | Caesars Digital |  | Managed and Branded |  | CEI Total |\n| Gross Goodwill: |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Balance as of January 1, 2020 | $ | —  |  |  | $ | 922  |  |  | $ | —  |  |  | $ | —  |  |  | $ | 922  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Transferred to assets held for sale | —  |  |  | (18) |  |  | —  |  |  | —  |  |  | (18) |  |\n| Acquired (a) | 6,873  |  |  | 2,141  |  |  | 50  |  |  | —  |  |  | 9,064  |  |\n| Balance as of December 31, 2020 | 6,873  |  |  | 3,045  |  |  | 50  |  |  | —  |  |  | 9,968  |  |\n| Accumulated Impairment: |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Balance as of January 1, 2020 | —  |  |  | (12) |  |  | —  |  |  | —  |  |  | (12) |  |\n| Impairment | —  |  |  | (100) |  |  | —  |  |  | —  |  |  | (100) |  |\n| Transferred to assets held for sale | —  |  |  | 8  |  |  | —  |  |  | —  |  |  | 8  |  |\n| Balance as of December 31, 2020 | —  |  |  | (104) |  |  | —  |  |  | —  |  |  | (104) |  |\n| Net carrying value, as of December 31, 2020  | $ | 6,873  |  |  | $ | 2,941  |  |  | $ | 50  |  |  | $ | —  |  |  | $ | 9,864  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Gross Goodwill: |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Balance as of January 1, 2021 | $ | 6,873  |  |  | $ | 3,045  |  |  | $ | 50  |  |  | $ | —  |  |  | $ | 9,968  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Acquired (a) | —  |  |  | 63  |  |  | 1,148  |  |  | —  |  |  | 1,211  |  |\n| Other  | 16  |  |  | (15) |  |  | —  |  |  | —  |  |  | 1  |  |\n| Balance as of December 31, 2021 | 6,889  |  |  | 3,093  |  |  | 1,198  |  |  | —  |  |  | 11,180  |  |\n| Accumulated Impairment: |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Balance as of January 1, 2021 | —  |  |  | (104) |  |  | —  |  |  | —  |  |  | (104) |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Balance as of December 31, 2021 | —  |  |  | (104) |  |  | —  |  |  | —  |  |  | (104) |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Net carrying value, as of December 31, 2021 (b) | $ | 6,889  |  |  | $ | 2,989  |  |  | $ | 1,198  |  |  | $ | —  |  |  | $ | 11,076  |  |\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_(a)See Note 3 for further detail.(b)$352 million of goodwill within our Regional segment is associated with reporting units with zero or negative carrying value.[Table of Contents](#i37dfc5eabc12461dbfc5ef573d80947e_7)86\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

The 2016 Repurchase program was terminated effective December 9, 2021. The 2021 Repurchase Program permits the Company to effect repurchases from time to time through a combination of open market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) transactions, and/or other derivative transactions. The 2021 Repurchase Program can be modified or terminated by the Board at any time.  \nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company did not repurchase any shares of common stock pursuant to the 2016 or 2021 Repurchase Programs.  \nPursuant to the authorization under the 2021 Repurchase Program, the Company entered into a $1.5 billion fixed dollar ASR with Barclays Bank PLC (“Barclays”). Upon payment of the $1.5 billion purchase price on January 4, 2022, the Company received a number of shares of CVS Health Corporation’s common stock equal to 80% of the $1.5 billion notional amount of the ASR or approximately 11.6 million shares at a price of $103.34 per share, which were placed into treasury stock in January 2022. At the conclusion of the ASR, the Company may receive additional shares equal to the remaining 20% of the $1.5 billion notional amount. The ultimate number of shares the Company may receive will depend on the daily volume-weighted average price of the Company’s stock over an averaging period, less a discount. It is also possible, depending on such weighted average price, that the Company will have an obligation to Barclays which, at the Company’s option, could be settled in additional cash or by issuing shares. Under the terms of the ASR, the maximum number of shares that could be delivered to the Company is 29.0 million.  \nDividends  \nThe quarterly cash dividend declared by the Board was $0.50 per share in 2021 and 2020. In December 2021, the Board authorized a 10% increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.55 per share effective in 2022. CVS Health Corporation has paid cash dividends every quarter since becoming a public company. Future dividend payments will depend on the Company’s earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors considered relevant by the Board.  \nRegulatory Requirements  \nThe Company’s insurance business operations are conducted through subsidiaries that principally consist of health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”) and insurance companies.

The special charges include severance and fringe benefit costs, in accordance with the Company's ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations, one-time termination benefits for the impacted manufacturing, engineering and SMG&A employees and other exit costs. These one-time termination benefits are being recognized over the future service period required for employees to earn these benefits. During fiscal 2021, the Company ceased production at its Hillview wafer fabrication facility located in Milpitas, California and determined that this facility met the held for sale criteria specified in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 360. See Note 6, Property, Plant and Equipment in these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for amounts reclassified.During fiscal 2021, the Company completed the sale of its facility and certain equipment in Singapore, which were previously classified as held for sale, for approximately $35.7 million, which resulted in a gain of $13.6 million. Concurrent with the sale, the Company entered into a short-term lease agreement to leaseback a portion of the facility while it completes its transition of related operations to its facilities in Penang, Malaysia and the Philippines, as well as to its outsourced assembly and test partners. Global Repositioning ActionsThe Company recorded net special charges of $274.1 million on a cumulative basis through January 29, 2022, as a result of organizational initiatives to better align its global workforce with the Company's long-term strategic plan. Special charges of $53.1 million recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 primarily consisted of $61.4 million of severance and benefit costs as well as charges recorded from the acceleration of equity awards in connection with the termination of a limited number of employees as part of the integration of the Acquisition. These charges were partially offset by a gain of $8.3 million recognized upon the sale of a business.Note 6 – Property, Plant and Equipment During fiscal 2021, the Company ceased production at its Hillview wafer fabrication facility located in Milpitas, California and determined that this facility met the held for sale criteria specified in ASC 360.

As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we have recognized a liability for interest and penalties of $3.8 million and $1.6 million, respectively.

Our U.S. federal income tax returns for years 2016 through 2019 are currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service.

FCX subsidiaries are subject to various national, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern emissions of air pollutants; discharges of water pollutants; generation, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, hazardous wastes and other toxic materials; and remediation, restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination. FCX subsidiaries that operate in the U.S. also are subject to potential liabilities arising under CERCLA and similar state laws that impose responsibility on current and previous owners and operators of a facility for the remediation of hazardous substances released from the facility into the environment, including damages to natural resources, in some cases irrespective of when the damage to the environment occurred or who caused it. Remediation liability also extends to persons who arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances or transported the hazardous substances to a disposal site selected by the transporter. These liabilities are often shared on a joint and several basis, meaning that each responsible party is fully responsible for the remediation if some or all of the other historical owners or operators no longer exist, do not have the financial ability to respond or cannot be found. As a result, because of FCX’s acquisition of FMC in 2007, many of the subsidiary companies FCX now owns are responsible for a wide variety of environmental remediation projects throughout the U.S., and FCX expects to spend substantial sums annually for many years to address those remediation issues. Certain FCX subsidiaries have been advised by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of the Interior, the Department of Agriculture and various state agencies that, under CERCLA or similar state laws and regulations, they may be liable for costs of responding to environmental conditions at a number of sites that have been or are being investigated to determine whether releases of hazardous substances have occurred and, if so, to develop and implement remedial actions to address environmental concerns. FCX is also subject to claims where the release of hazardous substances is alleged to have damaged natural resources (NRD) and to litigation by individuals allegedly exposed to hazardous substances. As of December 31, 2021, FCX had more than 100 active remediation projects, including NRD claims, in 24 U.S. states. The aggregate environmental obligation for approximately 60 percent of the active remediation projects totaled less than $20 million at December 31, 2021.  \nA summary of changes in estimated environmental obligations for the years ended December 31 follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|   | 2021 |  | 2020 |  | 2019 |\n| Balance at beginning of year | $ | 1,584  |  |  | $ | 1,561  |  |  | $ | 1,511  |  |\n| Accretion expensea | 104  |  |  | 102  |  |  | 102  |  |\n| Additionsb | 60  |  |  | 38  |  |  | 23  |  |\n| Reductionsb | (20) |  |  | (58) |  |  | (1) |  |\n| Spending | (64) |  |  | (59) |  |  | (74) |  |\n| Balance at end of year | 1,664  |  |  | 1,584  |  |  | 1,561  |  |\n| Less current portion | (64) |  |  | (83) |  |  | (106) |  |\n| Long-term portion | $ | 1,600  |  |  | $ | 1,501  |  |  | $ | 1,455  |  |\n\na.Represents accretion of the fair value of environmental obligations assumed in the 2007 acquisition of FMC, which were determined on a discounted cash flow basis.b.Adjustments to environmental obligations that do not provide future economic benefits are charged to operating income. Adjustments primarily reflect revisions for changes in the anticipated scope and timing of projects and other noncash adjustments.  \nEstimated future environmental cash payments (on an undiscounted and de-escalated basis) total $89 million in 2022, $80 million in 2023, $105 million in 2024, $98 million in 2025, $100 million in 2026 and $3.2 billion thereafter. The amount and timing of these estimated payments will change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements, changes in scope and timing of remediation activities, the settlement of environmental matters and as actual spending occurs.  \nAt December 31, 2021, FCX’s environmental obligations totaled $1.7 billion, including $1.5 billion recorded on a discounted basis for those obligations assumed in the FMC acquisition at fair value. On an undiscounted and de-escalated basis, these obligations totaled $3.7 billion. FCX estimates it is reasonably possible that these obligations could range between $3.3 billion and $4.2 billion on an undiscounted and de-escalated basis.  \nAt December 31, 2021, the most significant environmental obligations were associated with the Pinal Creek site in Arizona; the Newtown Creek site in New York City; historical smelter sites principally located in Arizona, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, New Jersey, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania; and uranium mining sites in the western U.S. The recorded environmental obligations for these sites totaled $1.4 billion at December 31, 2021.

Although the Company has a diversified loan portfolio, an economic downturn could have an adverse impact on the ability of its debtors to repay their loans. The outstanding balance of commercial mortgage loans range in size from $0.1 million to $9.6 million as of December 31, 2021 and from $0.1 million to $9.9 million as of December 31, 2020. Credit quality indicators for commercial mortgage loans are loan-to-value and debt-service coverage ratios. The loan-to-value ratio compares the principal amount of the loan to the fair value of the underlying property collateralizing the loan, and is commonly expressed as a percentage. The debt-service coverage ratio compares a property’s net operating income to its debt-service payments and is commonly expressed as a ratio. The loan-to-value and debt-service coverage ratios are generally updated annually in the fourth quarter.The following table presents the amortized cost basis of commercial mortgage loans, excluding allowance for credit losses, by origination year for certain key credit quality indicators at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | December 31, 2021 |\n|  | Origination Year |\n|  | 2021 |  | 2020 |  | 2019 |  | 2018 |  | 2017 |  | Prior |  | Total |  | % of Total |\n| Loan to value ratios (1): |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 70% and less | $ | 71.7  |  |  | $ | 5.6  |  |  | $ | —  |  |  | $ | —  |  |  | $ | 4.0  |  |  | $ | 99.8  |  |  | $ | 181.1  |  |  | 70.3  | % |\n| 71% to 80% | 61.8  |  |  | —  |  |  | —  |  |  | 4.7  |  |  | —  |  |  | 1.0  |  |  | 67.5  |  |  | 26.2  | % |\n| 81% to 95% | —  |  |  | —  |  |  | —  |  |  | —  |  |  | —  |  |  | 1.1  |  |  | 1.1  |  |  | 0.4  | % |\n| Greater than 95% | —  |  |  | —  |  |  | —  |  |  | —  |  |  | 5.8  |  |  | 2.1  |  |  | 7.9  |  |  | 3.1  | % |\n| Total | $ | 133.5  |  |  | $ | 5.6  |  |  | $ | —  |  |  | $ | 4.7  |  |  | $ | 9.8  |  |  | $ | 104.0  |  |  | $ | 257.6  |  |  | 100.0  | % |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | December 31, 2021 |\n|  | Origination Year |\n|  | 2021 |  | 2020 |  | 2019 |  | 2018 |  | 2017 |  | Prior |  | Total |  | % of Total |\n| Debt service coverage ratios (2): |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Greater than 2.0 | $ | 59.3  |  |  | $ | 5.6  |  |  | $ | —  |  |  | $ | —  |  |  | $ | —  |  |  | $ | 70.5  |  |  | $ | 135.4  |  |  | 52.6  | % |\n| 1.5 to 2.0 | 34.1  |  |  | —  |  |  | —  |  |  | 4.7  |  |  | 4.0  |  |  | 17.5  |  |  | 60.3  |  |  | 23.4  | % |\n| 1.0 to 1.5 | 40.1  |  |  | —  |  |  | —  |  |  | —  |  |  | —  |  |  | 9.9  |  |  | 50.0  |  |  | 19.4  | % |\n| Less than 1.0 | —  |  |  | —  |  |  | —  |  |  | —  |  |  | 5.8  |  |  | 6.1  |  |  | 11.9  |  |  | 4.6  | % |\n| Total | $ | 133.5  |  |  | $ | 5.6  |  |  | $ | —  |  |  | $ | 4.7  |  |  | $ | 9.8  |  |  | $ | 104.0  |  |  | $ | 257.6  |  |  | 100.0  | % |\n\nF-35\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

These liabilities are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets on a contract-by-contract basis upon commencement of services under the customer contract. These upfront customer payments are recognized as revenue over time as the obligations under the contracts are satisfied. Changes in the contract liability balances during the six months ended June 30, 2022 were not materially impacted by any other factors. The balance of contract liabilities was $35.6 million and $15.2 million as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.4. Performance Bonds and Guaranty Fund ContributionsPerformance Bonds and Guaranty Fund Contributions. CME has been designated as a systemically important financial market utility by the Financial Stability Oversight Council and is authorized to maintain cash accounts at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. At June 30, 2022, CME maintained $128.6 billion within the cash account at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. The cash deposit at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago is included within performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions on the consolidated balance sheets. Clearing House Contract Settlement. The clearing house marks-to-market open positions for all futures and options contracts twice a day (once a day for CME's cleared-only interest rate swap contracts). Based on values derived from the mark-to-market process, the clearing house requires payments from clearing firms whose positions have lost value and makes payments to clearing firms whose positions have gained value. Under the extremely unlikely scenario of simultaneous default by every clearing firm who has open positions with unrealized losses, the maximum exposure related to positions other than cleared-only interest rate swap contracts would be one half day of changes in fair value of all open positions, before considering the clearing house's ability to access defaulting clearing firms' collateral deposits. For CME's cleared-only interest rate swap contracts, the maximum exposure related to CME's guarantee would be one full day of changes in fair value of all open positions, before considering CME's ability to access defaulting clearing firms' collateral. During the first six months of 2022, the clearing house transferred an average of approximately $6.2 billion a day through its clearing systems for settlement from clearing firms whose positions had lost value to clearing firms whose positions had gained 16\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

Providing such access over the length of the tenant contract term represents the Company’s sole performance obligation under its tenant contracts. Site rental revenues from the Company's tenant contracts are recognized on a straight-line, ratable basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the relevant tenant contract, which generally ranges from five to 15 years for wireless tenants and three to 20 years for the Company's fiber solutions tenants (including from organizations with high-bandwidth and multi-location demands), regardless of whether the payments from the tenant are received in equal monthly amounts during the life of the tenant contract. Certain of the Company's tenant contracts contain (1) fixed escalation clauses (such as fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases) or inflation-based escalation clauses (such as those tied to the CPI), (2) multiple renewal periods exercisable at the tenant's option and (3) only limited termination rights at the applicable tenant's option through the current term. If the payment terms call for fixed escalations, upfront payments, or rent-free periods, the revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the agreement. When calculating its straight-line rental revenues, the Company considers all fixed elements of tenant contractual escalation provisions, even if such escalation provisions contain a variable element in addition to a minimum. The Company's assets related to straight-line site rental revenues include current amounts of $105 million included in \"Other current assets\" and non-current amounts of $1.7 billion included in \"Deferred site rental receivables\" as of March 31, 2022. Amounts billed or received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in \"Deferred revenues\" and \"Other long-term liabilities.\" Amounts to which the Company has an unconditional right to payment, which are related to both satisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations, are recorded within \"Receivables, net\" on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet.Services and Other RevenuesAs part of the Company’s effort to provide comprehensive communications infrastructure solutions, as an ancillary business, the Company offers certain services primarily relating to its Towers segment, predominately consisting of (1) site development services and (2) installation services. Upon contract commencement, the Company assesses its services to tenants and identifies performance obligations for each promise to provide a distinct service. The Company may have multiple performance obligations for site development services, which primarily include: structural analysis, zoning, permitting and construction drawings. For each of these performance obligations, services revenues are recognized at completion of the applicable performance obligation, which represents the point at which the Company believes it has transferred goods or services to the tenant. The revenue recognized is based on an allocation of the transaction price among the performance obligations in a respective contract based on estimated standalone selling price. The volume and mix of site development services may vary among contracts and may include a combination of some or all of the above performance obligations. Payments generally are due within 45 to 60 days and generally do not contain variable-consideration provisions. The transaction price for the Company's tower installation services consists of amounts for (1) permanent improvements to the Company's towers that represent a lease component and (2) the performance of the service. Amounts under the Company's tower installation service agreements that represent a lease component are recognized as site rental revenues on a straight-line basis over the length of the associated estimated lease term. For the performance of the installation service, the Company has one performance obligation, which is satisfied at the time of the applicable installation or augmentation and recognized as services and other revenues. Since performance obligations are typically satisfied prior to receiving payment from tenants, the unconditional right to payment is recorded within \"Receivables, net\" on the Company’s 8\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

As a result of the sale, we deconsolidated Egencia, recognized a gain of $401 million within gain (loss) on sale of business, net in the consolidated statement of operations and divested cash and restricted cash of $88 million. We received no cash for this transaction but Expedia Group became an indirect holder of an approximately 19% interest of GBT with an initial fair value of $815 million, and a subsidiary entered into a 10-year lodging supply agreement with GBT. We have elected to account for our investment under the fair value option (see NOTE 3 — Fair Value Measurements). The 19% of indirect interest is subject to changes based on final debt/cash and working capital adjustments and, any such adjustment, would impact our gain on the sale.In addition, during 2020 and 2021, in connection with our efforts to focus on our core businesses and streamline our activities, we committed to plans to divest certain smaller businesses primarily within our Retail segment. As a result, in 2020, we completed the sale of certain smaller businesses, including Bodybuilding.com and SilverRail, which combined resulted in a net losses of $13 million and net cash divested of $21 million. In 2021, we completed additional sales including Classic Vacations and Alice, which combined resulted in net gains of $57 million and net cash received of $27 million. The resulting gains and losses in these transactions were recorded within gain (loss) on sale of business, net in the consolidated statement of operations.None of these dispositions were considered a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations or financial results and they did not represent individually significant components of our business; therefore, they have not been reported as discontinued operations.

The convertible preferred stock issued in January 2018 were considered participating securities since the shares participated in dividends on common stock on an “as-converted” basis. All convertible preferred stock outstanding was converted to common stock during 2019.   \nThe two-class method uses an earnings allocation formula that treats participating securities as having rights to earnings that otherwise would have been available only to common stockholders. Under the two-class method, net income attributable to common stockholders is derived by subtracting the following from income from continuing operations:•preferred stock dividends; •deemed dividends for the amortization of the beneficial conversion feature recognized at issuance of the preferred stock (if any); and •an allocation of undistributed earnings between the common stock and the participating securities (convertible preferred stock) based on their respective rights to receive dividends.   \nNet losses were not allocated to the convertible preferred stock as they did not have a contractual obligation to share in the losses of FirstEnergy. FirstEnergy allocated undistributed earnings based upon income from continuing operations.   \nDiluted EPS reflects the dilutive effect of potential common shares from share-based awards and convertible shares of preferred stock. The dilutive effect of outstanding share-based awards was computed using the treasury stock method, which assumes any proceeds that could be obtained upon the exercise of the award would be used to purchase common stock at the average market price for the period. The dilutive effect of the convertible preferred stock in 2019 was computed using the if-converted method, which assumes conversion of the convertible preferred stock at the beginning of the period, giving income recognition for the add-back of the preferred stock dividends and undistributed earnings allocated to preferred stockholders. \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  | For the Years Ended December 31, |\n| Reconciliation of Basic and Diluted EPS of Common Stock |  | 2021 |  | 2020 |  | 2019 |\n| (In millions, except per share amounts) |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| EPS of Common Stock  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Income from continuing operations |  | $ | 1,239  |  |  | $ | 1,003  |  |  | $ | 904  |  |\n| Less: Preferred dividends  |  | N/A |  | N/A |  | (3) |  |\n| Less: Undistributed earnings allocated to preferred stockholders |  | N/A |  | N/A |  | (1) |  |\n| Income from continuing operations available to common stockholders |  | 1,239  |  |  | 1,003  |  |  | 900  |  |\n| Discontinued operations, net of tax |  | 44  |  |  | 76  |  |  | 8  |  |\n| Less: Undistributed earnings allocated to preferred stockholders |  | N/A |  | N/A |  | —  |  |\n| Income from discontinued operations available to common stockholders |  | 44  |  |  | 76  |  |  | 8  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Income attributable to common stockholders, basic |  | $ | 1,283  |  |  | $ | 1,079  |  |  | $ | 908  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Income allocated to preferred stockholders, preferred dilutive |  | N/A |  | N/A |  | 4 |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Income attributable to common stockholders, dilutive |  | $ | 1,283  |  |  | $ | 1,079  |  |  | $ | 912  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Share Count information: |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Weighted average number of basic shares outstanding |  | 545  |  |  | 542  |  |  | 535  |  |\n| Assumed exercise of dilutive share based awards |  | 1  |  |  | 1  |  |  | 3  |  |\n| Assumed conversion of preferred stock  |  | N/A |  | N/A |  | 4  |  |\n| Weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding |  | 546  |  |  | 543  |  |  | 542  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Income attributable to common stockholders, per common share: |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Income from continuing operations, basic |  | $ | 2.27  |  |  | $ | 1.85  |  |  | $ | 1.69  |  |\n| Discontinued operations, basic  |  | 0.08  |  |  | 0.14  |  |  | 0.01  |  |\n| Income attributable to common stockholders, basic  |  | $ | 2.35  |  |  | $ | 1.99  |  |  | $ | 1.70  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Income from continuing operations, diluted |  | $ | 2.27  |  |  | $ | 1.85  |  |  | $ | 1.67  |  |\n| Discontinued operations, diluted |  | 0.08  |  |  | 0.14  |  |  | 0.01  |  |\n| Income attributable to common stockholders, diluted |  | $ | 2.35  |  |  | $ | 1.99  |  |  | $ | 1.68  |  |\n\n  \n  \n80\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

These amounts primarily included $180 million of income tax benefits related to transformation costs, and acquisition, disposition and other related charges, $157 million of income tax benefits related to releases of foreign valuation allowances, $39 million of income tax benefits related to tax rate changes on deferred taxes, and $32 million of income tax benefits related to the change in pre-Separation tax liabilities, primarily those for which the Company shares joint and several liability with HP Inc. and for which the Company is indemnified by HP Inc. These benefits were partially offset by $337 million of net income tax charges associated with income from the Itanium litigation judgment, against which $244 million of income tax attributes previously subject to a valuation allowance were utilized, resulting in a net tax expense of $93 million.In fiscal 2020, the Company recorded $362 million of net income tax benefits related to items discrete to the year. These amounts primarily included $174 million of income tax benefits related to transformation costs, and acquisition, disposition and other related charges, $66 million of income tax benefits related to the change in pre-Separation tax liabilities, primarily those for which the Company shared joint and several liability with HP Inc. and for which the Company is indemnified by HP Inc., $57 million of income tax benefits related to Indian distribution tax rate changes, and $40 million of income tax benefits related to tax rate changes on deferred taxes. In fiscal 2019, the Company recorded $152 million of net income tax charges related to items discrete to the year. These amounts primarily included $488 million of net income tax charges related to changes in U.S. federal and state valuation allowances primarily as a result of impacts of the Tax Act and $40 million of income tax charges related to future withholding costs on potential intercompany distributions of earnings, the effects of which were partially offset by $274 million of income tax benefits related to the change in pre-Separation tax liabilities for which the Company shared joint and several liability with HP Inc., and $104 million of income tax benefits on transformation costs, and acquisition, disposition and other related charges.As a result of certain employment actions and capital investments the Company has undertaken, income from manufacturing and services in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates through 2037.

The Company made a one-time $100.0 million payment to Abbott in July 2020, and is making quarterly payments in subsequent years.   \n4. SPECIAL CHARGES  \nImpairment of Long-lived Assets  \nIn December 2019, the Company recorded a charge of $40.6 million to fully impair certain in-process research and development assets. These assets were acquired as part of the acquisition of Valtech Cardio Ltd. (\"Valtech\") in 2017. The Company measured the amount of the impairment by calculating the amount by which the carrying values exceeded the estimated fair values, which was based on projected discounted future net cash flows. Based on market and clinical trial developments at the time of the impairment, the Company re-evaluated the clinical development plans for the technologies acquired from Valtech, which resulted in a reduction to the projected near-term discounted future net cash flows related to the acquired mitral and tricuspid technology. The impairment was recorded to the Company’s Rest of World segment.  \nAcquisition of Intellectual Property  \nIn March 2019, the Company recorded a $24.0 million charge related to the acquisition of early-stage transcatheter intellectual property and associated clinical and regulatory experience.  \n5.

The change in fair value of available-for-sale debt securities is primarily a result of movement in interest rates subsequent to the purchase of the security.  \nFor each security in an unrealized loss position, the Company assesses whether it intends to sell the security or if it is more likely than not the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis for reasons such as liquidity, contractual or regulatory purposes. If the security meets this criterion, the decline in fair value is recorded in earnings. The Company does not intend to sell these securities prior to maturity and it is not likely that the Company will be required to sell these securities prior to maturity; therefore, the Company did not record an impairment for these securities.  \nIn addition, the Company monitors available-for-sale debt securities for credit losses. Certain investments have experienced a decline in fair value due to changes in credit quality, market interest rates and/or general economic conditions. The Company recognizes an allowance when evidence demonstrates that the decline in fair value is credit related. Evidence of a credit related loss may include rating agency actions, adverse conditions specifically related to the security, or failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled payments.  \nThe contractual maturities of short-term and long-term debt securities and restricted deposits are as follows ($ in millions):\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|   | March 31, 2022 |  | December 31, 2021 |\n|   | Investments |  | Restricted Deposits |  | Investments |  | Restricted Deposits |\n|   | AmortizedCost |  | FairValue |  | AmortizedCost |  | FairValue |  | AmortizedCost |  | FairValue |  | AmortizedCost |  | FairValue |\n| One year or less | $ | 1,543  |  |  | $ | 1,540  |  |  | $ | 611  |  |  | $ | 609  |  |  | $ | 1,390  |  |  | $ | 1,396  |  |  | $ | 368  |  |  | $ | 368  |  |\n| One year through five years | 6,519  |  |  | 6,327  |  |  | 400  |  |  | 382  |  |  | 6,212  |  |  | 6,294  |  |  | 460  |  |  | 457  |  |\n| Five years through ten years | 3,903  |  |  | 3,665  |  |  | 238  |  |  | 219  |  |  | 3,647  |  |  | 3,681  |  |  | 244  |  |  | 243  |  |\n| Greater than ten years | 93  |  |  | 91  |  |  | —  |  |  | —  |  |  | 73  |  |  | 78  |  |  | —  |  |  | —  |  |\n| Asset-backed securities | 3,166  |  |  | 3,051  |  |  | —  |  |  | —  |  |  | 3,028  |  |  | 3,034  |  |  | —  |  |  | —  |  |\n| Total | $ | 15,224  |  |  | $ | 14,674  |  |  | $ | 1,249  |  |  | $ | 1,210  |  |  | $ | 14,350  |  |  | $ | 14,483  |  |  | $ | 1,072  |  |  | $ | 1,068  |  |\n\n Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities due to call or prepayment options.

These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 22, 2022. The December 31, 2021 consolidated balance sheet data herein was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United States (“U.S.”). The results of operations for the three-month period ended March 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.Interest and financing expenses for the three-month period ended March 31, 2022 includes an expense of $17.5 million for the correction of out of period errors regarding overstated capitalized interest values in prior periods. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, Interest expense was understated by $11.4 million, $5.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively. The Company does not believe these adjustments are material to the consolidated financial statements for any of the prior periods presented or to the three-month period ended March 31, 2022, in which they were corrected.  \nNOTE 2—Acquisitions:On September 30, 2021, the Company signed a definitive agreement to acquire all of the outstanding equity of Guangxi Tianyuan New Energy Materials Co., Ltd. (“Tianyuan”), for approximately $200 million in cash. Tianyuan's operations include a recently constructed lithium processing plant strategically positioned near the Port of Qinzhou in Guangxi. The plant has designed annual conversion capacity of up to 25,000 metric tons of LCE and is capable of producing battery-grade lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide. The plant is currently in the commissioning stage and is expected to begin commercial production in the first half of 2022. The Company expects the transaction, which is subject to customary closing conditions, to close in the third quarter of 2022.  \nNOTE 3—Divestitures:On June 1, 2021, the Company completed the sale of its fine chemistry services (“FCS”) business to W. R. Grace & Co. (“Grace”) for proceeds of approximately $570 million, consisting of $300 million in cash and the issuance to Albemarle of preferred equity of a Grace subsidiary having an aggregate stated value of $270 million. The preferred equity can be redeemed at Grace’s option under certain conditions and will accrue payment-in-kind (“PIK”) dividends at an annual rate of 12% beginning two years after issuance.As part of the transaction, Grace acquired our manufacturing facilities located in South Haven, Michigan and Tyrone, Pennsylvania. The sale of the FCS business reflects the Company’s commitment to investing in its core, growth-oriented business segments. Historical financial statements include results from this business until divested on June 1, 2021.We determined that the FCS business met the assets held for sale criteria in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment during the first quarter of 2021.

The Company recorded equity earnings, net of taxes, of $311 million, $48 million, and $207 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, for Ilim. Foreign exchange gains (losses) included in equity earnings in 2021, were not material and JSC Ilim Group had no U.S. dollar-denominated debt outstanding as of December 31, 2021. Equity earnings includes an after-tax foreign exchange (loss) gain of $(50) million, and $32 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, primarily on the remeasurement of U.S. dollar-denominated net debt. The Company received cash dividends from the joint venture of $154 million, $141 million and $246 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company's investment in Ilim, which is recorded in Investments in the consolidated balance sheet, was $557 million and $393 million, respectively, which was $121 million and $127 million, respectively, more than the Company's proportionate share of the joint venture's underlying net assets.   \nThe differences primarily relate to currency translation adjustments and the basis difference between the fair value of our investment at acquisition and the underlying net assets. Prior to the spin-off of the Printing Papers segment on October 1, 2021, the Company was party to a joint marketing agreement with JSC Ilim Group, a subsidiary of Ilim, under which the Company purchased, marketed and sold paper produced by JSC Ilim Group.

Short-term Borrowings: Under Consumers’ commercial paper program, Consumers may issue, in one or more placements, investment-grade commercial paper notes with maturities of up to 365 days at market interest rates. These issuances are supported by Consumers’ revolving credit facilities and may have an aggregate principal amount outstanding of up to $500 million. While the amount of outstanding commercial paper does not reduce the available capacity of the revolving credit facilities, Consumers does not intend to issue commercial paper in an amount exceeding the available capacity of the facilities. At June 30, 2022, there were $45 million of commercial paper notes outstanding under this program at an interest rate of 1.950 percent, recorded as current notes payable on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ consolidated balance sheets.In December 2021, Consumers renewed a short-term credit agreement with CMS Energy, permitting Consumers to borrow up to $500 million at an interest rate of the prior month’s average one-month LIBOR minus 0.100 percent. At June 30, 2022, outstanding borrowings under the agreement were $32 million bearing an interest rate of 0.825 percent.Dividend Restrictions: At June 30, 2022, payment of dividends by CMS Energy on its common stock was limited to $6.6 billion under provisions of the Michigan Business Corporation Act of 1972.Under the provisions of its articles of incorporation, at June 30, 2022, Consumers had $1.9 billion of unrestricted retained earnings available to pay dividends on its common stock to CMS Energy. Provisions of the Federal Power Act and the Natural Gas Act appear to restrict dividends payable by Consumers to the amount of Consumers’ retained earnings. Several decisions from FERC suggest that, under a variety of circumstances, dividends from Consumers on its common stock would not be limited to amounts in Consumers’ retained earnings. Any decision by Consumers to pay dividends on its common stock in excess of retained earnings would be based on specific facts and circumstances and would be subject to a formal regulatory filing process.During the six months ended June 30, 2022, Consumers paid $433 million in dividends on its common stock to CMS Energy.Issuance of Common Stock: Under an existing equity offering program, CMS Energy may sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate sales price of up to $500 million in privately negotiated transactions, in “at the market” offerings, through forward sales transactions, or otherwise.Presented in the following table are details of CMS Energy’s forward sales contracts under this program at June 30, 2022:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  | Forward Price Per Share |\n| Contract Date | Maturity Date | Number of Shares | Initial | June 30, 2022 |\n| September 15, 2020 | December 31, 2022 | 846,759 |  | $ | 61.04  |  |  | $ | 57.57  |  |\n| December 22, 2020 | December 31, 2023 | 115,595 |  | 61.81  |  |  | 58.72  |  |\n\nThese contracts allow CMS Energy to either physically settle the contracts by issuing shares of its common stock at the then-applicable forward sale price specified by the agreement or net settle the contracts through the delivery or receipt of cash or shares.

The net impact of these changes in our preliminary valuations was a $102 million increase to property and equipment, net, a $63 million increase to goodwill, a $188 million decrease to intangible assets, a $47 million increase to other noncurrent assets, and a $24 million increase in other long-term liabilities. The effect of these revisions during the quarter did not have a material impact on our Statements of Operations.The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were determined using the market, income, and cost approaches, or a combination. Valuation methodologies under both a market and income approach used for the identifiable net assets acquired in the Horseshoe Baltimore acquisition make use of Level 3 inputs, such as expected cash flows and projected financial results. The market approach indicates value for a subject asset based on available market pricing for comparable assets.Trade receivables and payables and other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities were valued at the existing carrying values as they represented the estimated fair value of those items at the Horseshoe Baltimore acquisition date.Other personal property assets such as furniture, equipment, computer hardware, and fixtures were valued at the existing carrying values as they closely represented the estimated fair value of those items at the Horseshoe Baltimore acquisition date. The fair value of the buildings and improvements were estimated via the income approach. The remaining estimated useful life of the buildings and improvements is 40 years. The right of use asset and operating lease liability related to a ground lease for the site on which Horseshoe Baltimore is located was recorded at fair value and will be amortized over the estimated remaining useful life due to changes in the underlying fair value and estimated remaining useful life of the building and improvements. Renewal options are considered to be reasonably certain. The income approach was used to determine fair value, based on the estimated present value of the future lease payments over the lease term, including renewal options, using an incremental borrowing rate of approximately 7.6%.Customer relationships are valued using an income approach, comparing the prospective cash flows with and without the customer relationships in place to estimate the fair value of the customer relationships, with the fair value assumed to be equal to the discounted cash flows of the business that would be lost if the customer relationships were not in place and needed to be replaced. We estimate the useful life of these customer relationships to be approximately seven years.The fair value of the gaming rights was determined using the excess earnings method, which is an income approach methodology that estimates the projected cash flows of the business attributable to the gaming license intangible asset, which is net of charges for the use of other identifiable assets of the business including working capital, fixed assets and other intangible assets. The acquired gaming rights are considered to have an indefinite life.The goodwill acquired will generate amortization deductions for income tax purposes.The fair value of long-term debt has been calculated based on market quotes.[Table of Contents](#i37dfc5eabc12461dbfc5ef573d80947e_7)77\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}

Earnings Per ShareBasic earnings per share (“EPS”) amounts are computed by dividing earnings, after the deduction of preferred stock dividends declared, by the average number of common shares outstanding.

On August 18, 2021, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $1,500 of the Company's outstanding common stock. In the quarter ended March 31, 2022, the Company repurchased approximately 5 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $34.00 per share (excluding commissions cost) for $175 in cash. All of the shares repurchased have been retired. After giving effect to the share repurchases made through March 31, 2022, approximately $1,172 Board authorization remains available. Under the Company’s share repurchase programs (the “Share Repurchase Programs”), the Company may repurchase shares by means of trading plans established from time to time in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, block trades, private transactions, open market repurchases and/or accelerated share repurchase agreements or other derivative transactions. There is no stated expiration for the Share Repurchase Programs. Under its Share Repurchase Programs, the Company may repurchase shares from time to time, in amounts, at prices, and at such times as the Company deems appropriate, subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other considerations, including limits under its Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) (see [Note N](#ib58fce0f7c97431fb8cb1c861d028b02_82)). The Company is not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares or to do so at any particular time, and the Share Repurchase Programs may be suspended, modified or terminated at any time without prior notice.The approximately 15 million decrease in average shares outstanding (basic) for the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021 was primarily due to the approximately 19 million shares repurchased during 2021 and 2022. As average shares outstanding are used in the calculation for both basic and diluted EPS, the full impact of share repurchases was not realized in EPS in the first quarter of 2022 as share repurchases occurred at varying points during the quarter.The following shares were excluded from the calculation of average shares outstanding – diluted as their effect was anti-dilutive (shares in millions):\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | First quarter ended |  |  |\n|   | March 31, |  |  |\n|   | 2022 |  | 2021 |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Stock options(1) | —  |  |  | 1  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n(1)There were no anti-dilutive shares as of March 31, 2022.

At December 31, 2021, 5.9 million shares remained available for future issuance under the plans. During 2021, we granted 17,018 shares of common stock to our directors for 2020 board service fees.  Restricted Stock UnitsService-based restricted stock units granted to associates are valued at fair value of the shares on the date of grant less the present value of the dividends that holders of restricted stock units do not receive on the shares underlying the restricted stock units during the vesting period. Service-based restricted stock units generally cliff vest three years after the date of grant. We also grant restricted stock units which vest on a three year ratable vesting schedule. Service-based restricted stock units vested during the year had an intrinsic value of $26 million, $30 million and $25 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  We have performance-based awards that vest on the first day of March after a three-calendar-year performance period. These awards vest according to the level of three-year total shareholder return achieved compared with a peer group over a three-year performance period with payouts ranging from 0% to 200% for awards granted in 2021, 2020 and 2019. Three-year total shareholder return is calculated by using annualized total return of a stock to an investor due to capital gain appreciation plus reinvestment of all dividends.   \nFor the three-year performance period ended December 31, 2021, our total shareholder return exceeded six of our nine peers. We expect payout of these shares at the target level to occur in March of 2022. During 2021, we issued 113,648 shares of performance-based restricted stock units at the maximum-level performance hurdle for the three-year performance period ended December 31, 2020, as our total shareholder return exceeded eight of nine peers in our 2018 peer group. We issued 56,722 shares of performance-based restricted stock units during 2020 at the target-level performance hurdle for the three-year performance period ended December 31, 2019, as our total shareholder return exceeded five of nine peers in our 2017 peer group. Performance-based awards vested during the year had an intrinsic value of $11 million, $5 million and $2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.   \nThese performance-based awards are valued using a Monte-Carlo valuation on the date of grant, which uses a  risk-neutral framework to model future stock price movements based upon the risk-free rate of return, the volatility of each peer and the pairwise correlations of each peer being modeled. Compensation cost is recognized regardless of whether the market-based performance objective has been satisfied. We make assumptions to develop the Monte-Carlo model as follows: •Correlation coefficients are based upon the stock price data used to calculate the historical volatilities. The correlation coefficients are used to model the way the price of each entity's stock tends to move in relation to each other.Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2021 10-K - Page 170\n", "context_type": "string", "options": null, "program": null}
